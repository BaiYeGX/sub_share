1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,057
You were alive after all.

2
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,393
So you know who I am.

3
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:21,438
Kirisame.

4
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:28,737
Is the increase in Reggie deaths
in the last few days your doing?

5
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:34,951
We’ve been given an order to dispose
all Reggies for restructuring.

6
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:35,994
From where?

7
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,749
I got it. Fine.

8
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,334
Troublesome as ever.

9
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:44,252
And?

10
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:50,049
What is it this time?
Can I assume that I’m still worth using?

11
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,427
You really are interesting.

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,721
Mhm, I get that a lot.

13
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,268
I appreciate your hard work.

14
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,770
Thanks a lot.

15
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:07,650
It's true that I was the one
who left signs only you could understand

16
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,819
everywhere you went.

17
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,406
There's no way that Gilbert
in his last stages

18
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,408
could've made such an intricate design.

19
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,162
It was an incredibly
good piece of work, Kirisame.

20
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,500
Keith Kazama.
I’ve been meaning to ask you.

21
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,837
Why do you always show up
even when you know it's a trap?

22
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,215
Call it curiosity.

23
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,096
Those who kill God are to become devils.
Those who kill devils are to become Kings.

24
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,725
Hey, what do you think?

25
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:45,855
Am I the one being fooled by the stone?
Or is it you guys?

26
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:13,007
HANDGUN SUICIDE OF A MAN
WHO LOST HIS SANITY

27
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,687
THE WAY THE BLOOD SPLATTERED

28
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,689
TWO BULLET HOLES

29
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,288
THERE WAS ONE MORE PERSON HERE

30
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,750
THAT PERSON SHOT AND KILLED THE MAN

31
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:56,509
FAINTLY SEEN DISORDERLY FOOTSTEPS

32
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:01,514
ESTIMATING THE POLICE WOULD RETREAT,
AND KEITH ARRIVED.

33
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,018
THEY TOOK HIM

34
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,438
This was a trap.

35
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,695
Koku?

36
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,850
A little more to the right. To the right.

37
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,686
Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right.

38
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,498
No, no.

39
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,292
If you limit us, we can't investigate.

40
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,255
-It's our job.
-Can you take prints here and here?

41
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,090
How troublesome.

42
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,383
It can't be helped.

43
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,428
We need a special permit to perform
an autopsy on the Royal Family.

44
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,764
Then let's get one.

45
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,766
They won't give it to us.

46
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:41,447
We can't investigate
without knowing the victim’s situation.

47
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,825
What’s the cause of death?
The weapon?

48
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,619
How and what
are we supposed to be investigating?

49
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:47,954
Boris.

50
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,123
Don't you think it's strange?

51
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:56,129
Enough already. We can't work like this!

52
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,594
Our job is to remain right here.

53
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,514
Indeed. And after this,
there's an official announcement

54
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,266
from the Royal Bureau.

55
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,230
Any word from Lily?

56
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:15,273
None.

57
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,442
No scheduled contact either?

58
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,277
That's the usual, isn't it?

59
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,988
RCC is the standard.
Report, Communicate, Consult.

60
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,866
-Shut up, shut up, shut up...
-You youngins.

61
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,452
-Shut up, shut up...
-What do I do with you?

62
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,661
Huh?

63
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,474
So you're saying
there’s a possibility that Keith

64
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,351
was kidnapped by this Kirisame.
Is that right?

65
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,394
Yes.

66
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,355
I'm wondering.

67
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,315
Yes?

68
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,903
I think Keith wanted to get kidnapped.

69
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:06,657
He knew that this would happen
and still went there.

70
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,909
What for?

71
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,328
I don't know yet.

72
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:15,541
But he was looking into something
and found the "answer" as he calls it.

73
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,670
And he headed out to the scene
for his "confirmation" like always.

74
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,633
Knowing it was possible he could
be kidnapped during his "confirmation."

75
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,637
He should've said something.

76
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,058
He says useless stuff
like he needs to poop or has diarrhea

77
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,977
or constipation, but never tells me
the important things.

78
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,187
Lily?

79
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,316
That guy never believes anything
unless he sees it himself.

80
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:43,736
He’s smart, but he has
the mentality of a child.

81
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,782
His personality is like
a nasty and stupid fifth grader.

82
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,700
No, third grader!

83
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,746
Seriously, I hope he gets
his guts eaten clean and dies!

84
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,209
Your vocabulary for slander is impressive.

85
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:03,005
Anyway, we have no choice
but to follow the traces.

86
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:46,841
It's not moldy.
Just as I thought, it's here.

87
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,774
For now, let’s look around
and take things with us.

88
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,109
Got it.

89
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,159
Hey, take a look at this.

90
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,745
Is this you, Koku?

91
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,914
Ah, yes.

92
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,665
So cute.

93
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,293
That's Yuna, right?

94
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,799
That's Kirisame.

95
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,972
I wonder what this Kirisame wants to do?

96
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:39,185
There's no meaning to any of this.
He's only making a big fuss.

97
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,147
If he wants to kill the King,
he should just do it.

98
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,984
I don’t get why he's bringing
you and Keith into this.

99
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,654
He’s just adding in extra elements.

100
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,782
He’s endangering his own plan.

101
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,284
I don't get it at all.

102
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,246
I don't think the King’s life
is his objective.

103
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:04,335
I think his aim
is to make me kill the King.

104
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,724
It'd be nice if we could find some clues.

105
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,204
Hey Koku.

106
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,289
What is it?

107
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,873
What's that?

108
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,678
Lily, go!

109
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,047
Go faster!

110
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,798
Flooring it as we speak!

111
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:38,971
Thy form,
it flutters like a startled swan.

112
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,807
Thy beauty,
is as graceful as a playful dragon.

113
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,574
The autumn chrysanthemums of glory...

114
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,160
the bounding spring pines
as reminiscence,

115
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,872
thou art the hidden moon
of the light clouds.

116
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,876
As a flutter, thou art the swirling snow
of the flowing wind.

117
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,768
What should we do now?

118
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,853
Stick to the plan.

119
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,665
Hi.

120
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,709
Who's this?

121
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,378
It's been a while.

122
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:53,295
How’s the leg?

123
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,463
Seriously, who is that?

124
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:57,758
I've gotten quite used to it.

125
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,240
I'm glad.

126
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:30,583
The size is quite different,
so it's hard to find matching shoes.

127
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,253
Well whatever. We don't have time.

128
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,839
Let's go before they catch onto us.

129
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,756
Yeah.

130
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,258
Seriously. Who's this?

131
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,517
Well then, right this way.

132
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,329
Yuna!

133
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,246
Lily.

134
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,707
Thank God. You were safe.

135
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,211
Yes. I'm relieved
that you're safe too, Lily.

136
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:19,298
Ah, you’re so cute! You're so cute!
You're too good for Koku!

137
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,968
-Good girl, good girl, good girl!
-U-Um, please let me go.

138
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,475
Hey, what is this place?

139
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:33,479
It's the office we Market Makers
were using.

140
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:36,815
We won't have to worry
about Kirisame finding us here.

141
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,733
I see.

142
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:43,280
I think it's about time
we confirm the luggage that we collected.

143
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,292
No freaking way!

144
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,797
Wait a second. How are you alive?
I mean, alive and well, Your Majesty.

145
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,800
Wait, what do you even say
in a situation like this?

146
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,303
-Please calm down.
-I-I'll calm down.

147
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,309
Why did you save me?

148
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,932
The person who ordered the raid
on Jaula Blanca...

149
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,726
was me.

150
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,608
That's right. This is a good opportunity.

151
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,026
I wanted to ask you.

152
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,155
Why?

153
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:10,784
Dr. Kazama didn't tell you anything?

154
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,086
There's no point in hiding it.

155
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,548
This is something
I heard directly from him.

156
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,550
From Dr. Kazama?

157
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:33,307
Everything started
when you children were born.

158
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,853
Your body cells can reset and regenerate.

159
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,772
And instantly as well.

160
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,566
That can become a panacea.

161
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,362
But you can only transplant them
to your kind.

162
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,616
If we tried with anyone else, their cells
would turn cancerous within minutes.

163
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:56,080
It's a safety mechanism
to protect you and your kind.

164
00:15:56,705 --> 00:16:00,334
But there's a key to cancel this effect.

165
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:05,130
A neutral-bodied Canon
who has met a special condition.

166
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,051
By choosing you, that Canon
will transform into a female.

167
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,889
She will then turn into a key
to cancel you out.

168
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,643
It'll be possible to transplant
the multiplied cells

169
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:20,688
of the next generation to us humans.

170
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,441
Moreover, the blood will drive us forever.

171
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,070
There'll be no need
to consider compatibility,

172
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,281
and regenerative medicine within minutes
will become possible.

173
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:35,494
Everything will change.
It's like a dream.

174
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,747
Nearly all diseases could be treated.

175
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,545
Enormous interest will occur from this.

176
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:49,466
A generation where only the rich
can buy their lifespan is coming.

177
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,219
If it was just lives, it'd be fine.

178
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:57,224
But your cells can even conquer time.

179
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,978
A semi-eternal life
wouldn't be impossible either.

180
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,773
God's rights can be bought with money.

181
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,779
A dispute over that interest
is unimaginable.

182
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:14,324
This country just recovered
from being a burnt field.

183
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,535
And it has no military power.

184
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,165
You couldn't develop decent weapons
under the Defeated Country Clause.

185
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,085
Therefore, you used human weapons
called Reggies.

186
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:30,049
Reggies are a necessary evil.
Canons are overkill.

187
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,302
So that's your conclusion?

188
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,683
If you disposed of us,
then there'd be no conflict.

189
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:43,312
All in the name of national ethics.

190
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,272
That’s why you ordered the raid?

191
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,861
You tried to protect what you needed to.

192
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,112
But...

193
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:59,620
You didn't acknowledge that
we are also alive just like you.

194
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:07,628
A one-sided justice. That may be true.

195
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:12,382
But what you did was simply murder.

196
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,849
May sentience reincarnate
and be born from the six paths,

197
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,186
and may the wheels be endless.

198
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,650
At this point, it's already too late
to atone for my sins,

199
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,902
but please allow me to help you.

200
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:39,159
After that, I'll leave my life
in your hands once again.

201
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,833
Where's Keith?

202
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,127
What about inside the Royal Palace?

203
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,464
I think he would have a trump card
up his sleeve in times of emergencies.

204
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:56,802
I had the same idea,
but didn't find any signs of that.

205
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,850
Somewhere they won't need to keep nearby,

206
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,977
yet can't be easily snatched away.

207
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,479
They have their own domain.

208
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,148
Most likely.

209
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,984
How about the Amo District?

210
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,738
This area's managed by the military.

211
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:22,995
Since it’s used for military exercises,
it’s off limits for anybody else.

212
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,331
There’s no one there.
It’s like a natural prison.

213
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,875
Sounds like the place to be.

214
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,919
All of you don't understand
Kirisame at all.

215
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,045
What do you mean?

216
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:37,718
The man is a romantic for logic.
Double standard.

217
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,304
You can't think so straight.

218
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:45,893
What kind of fierce insinuation is that?
Sheesh.

219
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,062
Why am I surrounded by all these weirdos?

220
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,733
-Yuna, you're my only ray of hope--
-Lily.

221
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,613
Kirisame wanted to make
Koku commit the assassinations.

222
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,989
Oh.

223
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,369
Now I get it.
He's not simply confining Keith.

224
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,997
There's meaning to having Koku join in.

225
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,250
He's our King.

226
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:14,421
Kirisame believed in Jet Black
more than anyone else.

227
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,636
How many ancient ruins exist?

228
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:25,224
There's a lot.
There's no time to go to each one.

229
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,725
We have to narrow them down.

230
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,227
Then, shouldn't it be a place where it has

231
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,897
the deepest connection
to the Black-winged King?

232
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,357
Kazan.

233
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,985
He said he was having him rest
in a special place.

234
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,612
A good place.

235
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:43,242
Near the ocean,
and a paradise if he had wings.

236
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,451
A paradise?

237
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,787
That's what he said.

238
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:54,461
The Four Towers built to protect
Jet Black's North, South, East, and West.

239
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,966
I heard it was a holy place connected
to the Black-winged King.

240
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,593
What about there?

241
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:32,494
