1
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,828
What are you trying to make me do?

2
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,830
You're gonna help me with a job.

3
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,332
A job?

4
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,335
I refuse.

5
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,463
You’re fine with something happening
to Keith Flick?

6
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,590
Leave me alone.

7
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,343
Fine, but if he dies...

8
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,305
I’ll go after Yuna next.

9
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,598
Don't mock me!

10
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,601
If you don’t accept,
then I’ll kill Canopus.

11
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,354
He'll die in four days anyway
if you leave him be.

12
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:49,818
Next is Yuna.
Then Lily Hoshina. Her family.

13
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:54,072
Everyone you know will die.

14
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,157
Koku.

15
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,411
I’m going to have you kill God.

16
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,163
God?

17
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,500
A symbol that anyone can imagine.

18
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,296
The details of the operation are in there.

19
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,590
We're going to assign you some people,

20
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,969
and you'll have to eliminate them
within 48 hours.

21
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,472
Get it done and we'll release Keith Flick.

22
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,307
You don't, we reset the timer.

23
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,935
We'll kill someone else.

24
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,187
For example...

25
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,731
Scary.

26
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,734
Even if you kill us, you can't save Yuna.

27
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:38,449
It's your role to save her. Always.

28
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,747
What’s wrong? Aren’t you going to kill me?

29
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:51,087
Oh Canon of Jaula Blanca,
may you swing down your blade.

30
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:55,758
I've been prepared since that day
I sent out those orders for the raid.

31
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:59,304
But I shall not become ash.

32
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,621
What should I do?

33
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,470
He hasn't changed.

34
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,889
I told you, didn't I?

35
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:46,476
Reality won't hit him
until he kills someone first.

36
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,771
He's mocking us.

37
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:55,026
You're soft and weak...

38
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,778
In the end...

39
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,238
you'll throw us away.

40
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,097
Your Majesty!

41
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,349
Please explain!

42
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,897
You have to explain to us!

43
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,482
Take responsibility!

44
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,276
Stop human experiments!

45
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,610
Don't run away!

46
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,949
Where’s Zachary?

47
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,909
The thing is, there's still nothing.

48
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:49,038
Not even a declaration of crime
or a demand for a ransom.

49
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,873
There wouldn't be.

50
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,085
If that thing
is a Jaula Blanca child, that is.

51
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,841
Vengeance, is it?

52
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,471
Your Highness.

53
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,389
Go.

54
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,945
Your Highness.

55
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,158
The people, no,
the world is becoming aware.

56
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,662
Perhaps it's time
we put in a more advanced system.

57
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,875
This country was in ruins,
and recovered thanks to Zachary

58
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:37,086
and Dr. Albert Ross' achievements.

59
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,963
You should know that.

60
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,631
But...

61
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,052
Sudden changes will provoke chaos.

62
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,763
I'm saying that I need time.

63
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,222
However...

64
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:52,977
That coup d'etat commotion the other day.
You're the one who sparked it, right?

65
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:05,281
Gilbert Ross running wild and the Reggie
becoming history are both facts.

66
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:10,286
Knowing everything that I know,
I don't plan to deny any of your actions.

67
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,332
But it’s also true that the fear
the Reggies create

68
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:18,711
maintains the authority
of the Royal Palace.

69
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,380
That's a convenient interpretation.

70
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,966
By being persistent, it's also possible

71
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,302
that it would put the nation
in a tough spot.

72
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,054
It's fine already.

73
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:33,351
Make it a reality in your generation.
It's a future that's not too far away.

74
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:36,062
But for now, it's my country.

75
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,273
That's true.

76
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,321
What?

77
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,033
Your Highness.

78
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,911
Zachary has been found.

79
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:02,964
<i>We're broadcasting live</i>
where Senator Zachary's body was found.

80
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:08,010
<i>Killer B, who has been laying low</i>
for a while, left a mark at the scene.

81
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,388
<i>There are also people voicing their fears</i>

82
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:13,349
<i>regarding the dangers</i>
of the serial murders starting again.

83
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,517
Look at this.

84
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:19,021
<i>There's been an unconfirmed witness report</i>
that the victim was attacked

85
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,398
<i>by a monster with wings.</i>

86
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,108
Mother of God.

87
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,443
They even uploaded images of the body.

88
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,445
It got leaked.

89
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,906
Mario, Boris, come with me.

90
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,116
I'll talk to the boss.

91
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,492
-Roger.
-Got it.

92
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:36,038
Kaela, Bran. Look into
where they got the information from.

93
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,457
Illegal sources okay?

94
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,083
I'll leave it to you!

95
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,210
Lily! Please find Keith!

96
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,714
Only you would know. Please!

97
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,174
Ah, y-yes!

98
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,593
And this one.

99
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,513
Bran! I'm headed to my cubicle,
so take over.

100
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,973
Got it!

101
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,393
Hold on.

102
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,729
What’s the security code?

103
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,397
My measurements!

104
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,482
Still the same?

105
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,525
Gained two cm. on my waist!

106
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,111
Too much booze and carbs.

107
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,905
Currently constipated!

108
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,439
Is there a problem?

109
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,944
Everything is under control.
Please do not worry.

110
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,988
Otherwise, how were things
on your end?

111
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,074
He turned me down.

112
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:57,036
He won't accept the harsh truth
of moving on from the past.

113
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,454
I see.

114
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:04,168
We’re proceeding as planned.
We can't wait any longer.

115
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,881
We need to begin the second generation
research as soon as possible.

116
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:13,844
I got intel that the Eastern powers will
invest heavily for the Canon Project.

117
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,514
That land is the Tiger of the East.

118
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,016
If we hesitate, they'll soon catch up...

119
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,144
and all of our interests
will be monopolized.

120
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,689
We can't waste any time.

121
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,858
It seems so.

122
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,418
That was close.

123
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,298
Getting dehydrated...

124
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,217
At best I've got 12 more hours.

125
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,972
Huh?

126
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,932
Rain?

127
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,283
I see, so it comes up to even here, huh.

128
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,586
Are you sure about this?

129
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,090
Going to the public
when a killer is still out there.

130
00:11:56,674 --> 00:12:00,302
I'm prepared to face death
every time I appear in public.

131
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:04,348
I'll always live as a proud King
and die as such.

132
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,394
That's a monarch's fate.

133
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,939
I learned that from my father,
who ruled before me.

134
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,452
Your Majesty.

135
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,796
What’s going on?

136
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,756
A trespasser inside the palace.

137
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,468
We believe it’s the same thing
that attacked Sir Zachary.

138
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,762
Impossible! From where?

139
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,848
We must take you to a safe place.

140
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,099
Let’s go.

141
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,100
No.

142
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,643
We're going to proceed as is.

143
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:59,523
I understand how you feel,
but the attendees are in danger.

144
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,901
We must suspend the ceremony
and evacuate everyone.

145
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,196
Your Highness, you should go
to a safe place as well.

146
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,906
Your Majesty!

147
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,373
Is it a bomb?

148
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,137
Come with me.

149
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:54,930
What?

150
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,767
Until a certain issue is resolved,
I'm going to have you hide.

151
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,187
If you obey me calmly,

152
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,189
I will ensure your safety.

153
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:09,111
Y-You’re telling me to believe you?
The one who killed Zachary?

154
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,237
It wasn't me!

155
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,493
It's too bad,
but Kirisame was right, huh?

156
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,750
It seems you're not determined
to join our side.

157
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,002
What are you talking about?

158
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,629
The plan is already in motion.

159
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:31,175
We don't have time,
so we'll force things forward.

160
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,987
Why are you protecting him?

161
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,698
Kirisame ordered you
to kill him, right?

162
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,753
As expected, it was just like you said.

163
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:56,051
Yes, I understand.
No problem, I'll do it myself.

164
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,049
Koku.

165
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,563
You're...

166
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,034
No need to go after him.

167
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:42,110
