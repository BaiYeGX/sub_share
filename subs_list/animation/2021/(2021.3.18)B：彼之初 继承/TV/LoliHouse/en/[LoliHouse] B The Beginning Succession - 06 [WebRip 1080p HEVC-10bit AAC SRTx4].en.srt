1
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,581
I screwed up.

2
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,460
I was supposed to be able to go
a little bit further.

3
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,088
Guess it wasn't strong enough after all.

4
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,516
I suppose it's a matter of time now.

5
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,668
Geez, where did you go?

6
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,424
Koku? What's wrong?

7
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,301
<i>I found Keith.</i>

8
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,679
Really? What a relief.

9
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,473
Then I'll leave him to you.

10
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,642
There's a lot happening here and...

11
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,394
<i>Please come now.</i>

12
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,940
What, but you saved him, didn't you?

13
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,400
<i>About that...</i>

14
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,447
He's breathing,
but he won't open his eyes.

15
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,449
His temperature is too low.

16
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,827
<i>What about an ambulance?</i>

17
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,412
I called one.

18
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,746
-Isn't it okay?
-But...

19
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,749
<i>At this rate, he might...</i>

20
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,339
Got it. I'll head there right away.

21
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,386
Until then, tell me the specifics.

22
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,351
I'm glad to see you're safe.

23
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,353
How insolent.

24
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,355
Any issues?

25
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,608
A few police officials spotted us,

26
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,652
but there's no need to worry.

27
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,403
I see.

28
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:03,618
With this, I suppose
you can finally dispose of me secretly.

29
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,870
Correct.

30
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,457
I had the trajectory corrected
to fit my scenario.

31
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,461
Nicely done, Kirisame.

32
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,674
He's my excellent vassal.

33
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,677
Everything is exactly as you predicted.

34
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,638
Please leave the rest to me.

35
00:04:57,296 --> 00:04:58,756
You finally woke up.

36
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:17,567
<i>The King has been missing</i>
since the attack several days ago...

37
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,986
-So that's how it is.
-Huh?

38
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,698
Hey now, wouldn't you want to freak out

39
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,327
and say things like, "Where am I?"
"What happened?"

40
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,746
<i>After the attack, the suspects fled...</i>

41
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,663
Why?

42
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,081
Roger dodger.

43
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,708
How do you feel?

44
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,755
<i>The King is...</i>

45
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,173
Like shit.

46
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,632
I bet.

47
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,472
Here you go.

48
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:48,931
What's this?

49
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:52,518
I promised you, remember?
That we'll eat together next time.

50
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,353
It's super good.

51
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,315
There's no way I can eat this.

52
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,150
I'm a patient.

53
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,860
I'll eat it tomorrow.

54
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,487
Eat it now.

55
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:10,787
Well?

56
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,664
Super good.

57
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,208
Right?

58
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,298
Solo investigations
are prohibited from now on!

59
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,133
Hmph.

60
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,303
Geez.

61
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:33,309
<i>Just now, we were able to confirm</i>
the car carrying His Majesty.

62
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,692
We were worried,
but I'm glad everything's fine now.

63
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:42,944
It's totally not.

64
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,147
Let me out of here!

65
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,694
This isn't what you promised.

66
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:25,903
Promised?

67
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:32,118
You vowed to destroy the Reggies
and use the Canons to support my reign!

68
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,203
Ah, that was a lie.

69
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:39,709
We'll continue to use the Reggies
as we always have.

70
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,171
You understand nothing.

71
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,340
Governing the nation through madness
is archaic.

72
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,717
It's time for reformation!

73
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,178
You're the one who understands nothing.

74
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,722
Canons and Reggies are both necessities.

75
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:59,979
Eradicating something to make reform
is just a childish idea.

76
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:04,233
Even between conflicting entities,
a symbiotic relationship exists.

77
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,781
A wise King tolerates both good and evil.

78
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,828
So put your heart at ease.

79
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:19,749
I'll accept you as well. I won't kill you.

80
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,835
Instead, we shall have you atone

81
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,796
for your sins as a traitor
towards the King.

82
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,551
The mastermind who attempted

83
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,429
to assassinate His Majesty
by using Killer B.

84
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:36,807
Cut the crap.
What part of that is "accepting" me?

85
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,269
That's right.

86
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,147
If you eliminate me,
the Royal Family will end.

87
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,315
You're okay with that?

88
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,737
Just how foolish can you be?

89
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,032
You can't lay a hand on me.

90
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:01,207
Hey, are you listening, you traitor?

91
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,585
Hey! Wait! Let me out of here!

92
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,839
No way.

93
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:13,094
The King and Kirisame
are working together.

94
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,180
They've been manipulating us.

95
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,643
What should we do now?

96
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,271
Well...

97
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:29,193
For now, there's nothing we can do.

98
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:34,865
Well, you say that, but Koku
and the others might get targeted again.

99
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,831
I'm worried.

100
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,125
Where's Koku?

101
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,211
He's laying low for now.

102
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:51,465
They're chasing Killer B, not Koku, right?

103
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,219
I said they wouldn't learn
and tried to stop him, but...

104
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,222
He worried about a lot
involving this case.

105
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,849
How very like him.

106
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:04,437
We have to address the false charge
for the raid on the Royal Palace.

107
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:20,202
Oh, got it. I'll let everyone know.

108
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,287
Bye.

109
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,081
What do you do with this?

110
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,044
It seems Genie
has regained consciousness.

111
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:32,673
The King is also safe,
so isn't everything settled?

112
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,133
All's well that ends well.

113
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,051
<i>Bran.</i>

114
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,637
The crucial Killer B
is still on the loose.

115
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,556
Don't slack
until we arrest him.

116
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,184
<i>Sir, yes, sir.</i>

117
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,853
It's fine being haughty and all,

118
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,064
but the investigation's stalled,
you know?

119
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,611
<i>There's no progress,</i>

120
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,905
<i>so it's no wonder</i>
we're on other cases.

121
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,450
Weird cases have been on the rise, too.

122
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,493
Am I wrong?

123
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,579
Recently, the incidence of heinous crimes

124
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,248
has been on the rise.
And unnaturally, too.

125
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,250
There isn't even time to date.

126
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,253
Say that after you find someone.

127
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,595
There he is!

128
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:20,930
That's him, huh?

129
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,473
All right, let's go.

130
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,445
Mario, he went your way.

131
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,365
<i>I can see him from here.</i>
We'll sandwich him.

132
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,324
Roger.

133
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,344
Stop!

134
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,851
There. East of Brandon's direction,
30 meters ahead.

135
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,866
Whoa, whoa.

136
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,579
What's going on?

137
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,208
Hey, that's...

138
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,027
Here they come swarming in.
Just like bugs.

139
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:31,453
It's true the results are excellent,
but don't you know any other way?

140
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,332
You're so tactless.

141
00:14:38,877 --> 00:14:42,006
Hey, are you really okay with this?

142
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,809
Koku.

143
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:58,606
<i>At the crime scene, a large symbol</i>
of Killer B is visible on the wall.

144
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,900
<i>Police haven't made a statement...</i>

145
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,859
Wow.

146
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:06,697
<i>Unconfirmed reports say the victim</i>
is a man in his 30s or 40s...

147
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,617
Why would he do something like that?

148
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,785
I wonder if he's getting desperate.

149
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,580
Maybe we cornered him a bit too much.

150
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,332
You need to take this seriously.

151
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,916
Yeah, yeah.

152
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,793
What do you think?

153
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,892
<i>We're at Dante Street in Old Town.</i>

154
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,895
<i>Judging by the method</i>
and the "B" symbol left behind,

155
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:44,151
<i>the Royal Police declared that this crime</i>
was committed by the infamous Killer B.

156
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,444
Where are you going?

157
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,448
He's calling out to me.

158
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,012
I got your message.

159
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,056
The one that said, "I'm right here."

160
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,830
I have something to say to you myself.

161
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,543
I finally understand your power.

162
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:28,881
In a sense,
Yukikaze's hypothesis was correct.

163
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:37,389
No matter what threat you face,
you always manage to survive.

164
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,981
You weren't supposed to win
against Asagiri.

165
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:50,903
She's a next-gen model born
from the research at Jaula Blanca.

166
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,697
Her performance specs are way above us.

167
00:17:58,494 --> 00:17:59,953
Yet, why?

168
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:09,338
Your body cells instantly adapt
to any environment,

169
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,048
and then evolve.

170
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:13,258
Regardless of your will.

171
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,848
Therefore, the data itself is variable
and measurement has no meaning.

172
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,352
Even if you fight a Canon
who's stronger than you,

173
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,354
you would easily prevail.

174
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,857
The time it takes to adapt
is so astoundingly fast.

175
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,653
I'm not talking about just combat.

176
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:35,656
If you have that power,
you can do anything.

177
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,536
It's the one and only peerless power.

178
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,665
You truly are our King.

179
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,671
Koku, we need you.
Can you come with me?

180
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,688
