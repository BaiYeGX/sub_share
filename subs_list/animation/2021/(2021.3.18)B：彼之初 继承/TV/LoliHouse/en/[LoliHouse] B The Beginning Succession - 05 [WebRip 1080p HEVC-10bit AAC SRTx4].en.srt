1
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,326
Too bad.

2
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,620
This was the wrong place.

3
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,833
He's probably dead just about now.

4
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,672
Just like Kirisame said.

5
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,510
That Koku would definitely
choose the wrong one.

6
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:37,055
It seems like you've always been that way.

7
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,769
Since you've come all this way,
why don't you play with me a bit?

8
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,854
I don't have time to keep you company.

9
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,655
Even if you don't have time, I do!

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,417
Are you stupid?

11
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,253
Don't get in my way.

12
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,424
They say you're a really good person.

13
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,595
When Kirisame and Yukikaze talk about you,

14
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,140
they show kind eyes
they usually never show.

15
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:23,935
Nostalgia, is it called?
They sometimes laugh, too.

16
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,937
I hate that.

17
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:31,985
I really hate it. When they talk about
something I don't know.

18
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,530
I always feel that it's really disgusting.

19
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:39,284
I think about how I'd hate it
if this feeling continued.

20
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,572
I'll kill you!

21
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,847
That's...

22
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,248
I finally found you.

23
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,750
Kazan.

24
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:21,219
Not even a greeting, huh?

25
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,888
So cold as usual.

26
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,099
There's no need for that.

27
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,934
Have I ever given you one?

28
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,436
You're right.

29
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,855
And? What do you want?

30
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,441
We're in a hurry here.

31
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,819
Don't be like that.

32
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,863
I thought we could play
around like old times.

33
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,491
Be nostalgic about the past.

34
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,327
We're friends, aren't we?

35
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,496
Playing is fine.

36
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,500
But you couldn't do anything
unless you formed a faction.

37
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,294
Are you sure you're
okay by yourself?

38
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,548
What an honor, my Queen.

39
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,050
You haven't changed
a bit from back then.

40
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,262
In fact, you've become
more beautiful than before--

41
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,639
And you're the same weakling
just like before.

42
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:15,356
That part of you has always pissed me off.

43
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,078
I've copied you.

44
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,416
The reason I fought you a few times before
was to determine your abilities.

45
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,588
Yukikaze copied your abilities to me.

46
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,133
In other words, I've surpassed you.

47
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,098
Do you know what this means?

48
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,607
It means Kirisame has no
use for you anymore!

49
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,166
How futile.

50
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,130
You have no chance of winning!

51
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,423
Give up!

52
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,525
Why?

53
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:46,424
No. Impossible!

54
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,736
Why?

55
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,115
Why?

56
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,950
Why?

57
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,994
Why?

58
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,230
Why?

59
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,148
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

60
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,692
I was...

61
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,078
Do it!

62
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,462
Tell Kirisame to never
come near me again.

63
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,967
If he comes any closer,
I'll show no more mercy.

64
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,641
Whoops.

65
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,143
Sorry, but that's all the time
we have for today.

66
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,896
See you later, ladies.

67
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,525
The next time we meet,
I'll kill you for sure.

68
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,830
Izanami.

69
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,126
That was completely just to buy time.

70
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:14,674
Call it a hunch, but I think something
is happening at the other towers as well.

71
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,927
Let's hurry.

72
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,037
We're being followed.

73
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,457
Could they be the people targeting you,
Your Majesty?

74
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,501
Recognize them?

75
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,544
No.

76
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,839
But if we think
of the situation right now,

77
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,091
they're likely not here
to help us, either.

78
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,300
Most likely.

79
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,052
Let's shake them off our tail.

80
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,470
Can you do it?

81
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,806
Please hold on tight.

82
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,975
And sorry if you get motion sickness.

83
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,681
It's gonna get bumpy!

84
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,869
Aw yeah! Your Majesty,
it went absolutely perfectly well!

85
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,469
That was close.

86
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,263
Crap!

87
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,233
Your Majesty, get off!

88
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,293
The Royal Police?

89
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,810
-Wait a second. Listen to me!
-Lily!

90
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,979
Boris!

91
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,564
You're the suspect?

92
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,692
Quit joking around and get these off me!

93
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:24,613
She's one of our investigators.
Would you mind letting her go?

94
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,324
I'm afraid we can't. Excuse me.

95
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,619
Don't be like that.
You have my word.

96
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,621
Lily, where's your badge?

97
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,872
In my pocket.

98
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,251
-Here?
-Don't touch my boob, old man!

99
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,253
It's a force majeure.

100
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,386
Understood.

101
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,388
We got a confirmation.

102
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:55,978
Ow, what is all this?

103
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,230
That's what I want to know.

104
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,148
Huh?

105
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:05,487
H-His Majesty, the King!
So you are the suspect!

106
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,364
I'm telling you, I'm not!

107
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,084
This way, Your Majesty.

108
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,470
What is the meaning of this?

109
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,807
Please tell us what's going on already.

110
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,228
It's not necessary for you to know.

111
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,481
All you need to do
is obey me and move.

112
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,482
Wha...

113
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,868
I understand.

114
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,793
I don't have time to be doing something
like this. Let me out of here!

115
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,796
If I don't hurry,
Keith will be in trouble!

116
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,548
Even if you say so...

117
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,634
Another Keith-related thing, huh?

118
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:13,305
Trouble always has
his name stamped on it.

119
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,558
What in the world is going on?

120
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:22,189
We were sent out without being told
any details as well.

121
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:26,610
We even just found out moments ago
that the King was safe.

122
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,155
Rather, would you tell us
what's going on?

123
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,865
Keith's been kidnapped.

124
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,575
What?

125
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:39,748
I was on the way to the location
where we believe Keith is being confined.

126
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,126
I'll tell you details on that later.

127
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,628
Got it.

128
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,089
We'll help you as well.

129
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,092
But it seems
we can't move out immediately.

130
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,136
Boris, if you please.

131
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,345
Right.

132
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:58,892
Hey.

133
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,521
What'll happen to the King?

134
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:04,982
He'll be all right.

135
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,568
A team with the Royal Bureau is on it.

136
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,822
I trust he'll be returning
to the Palace safely from here.

137
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,866
I see.

138
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,339
Your Majesty,
I'm so glad that you're safe.

139
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:35,596
Let us go.
His Highness is expecting us.

140
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,412
Who's that?

141
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,290
Hey, hurry and let's get going.

142
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,418
Do you know who he is?

143
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,171
I feel like I've seen him
somewhere before.

144
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:13,008
Yeah, he's a guy who reports directly
to the Royal Family.

145
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,760
He barged into our place suddenly

146
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:17,930
and boastfully started ordering us
to do this and that.

147
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,598
What's his name?

148
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:23,811
Name? His name was, you know, that.
He had a unique name and...

149
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,106
Ah, it's on the tip of my tongue, but...

150
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,158
Kirisame!

151
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,160
Right, Kirisame!

152
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,664
Crap!

153
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:45,916
Hey, Lily!

154
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,492
There's no mistaking it. He was here.

155
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,876
That's...

156
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,555
I see.

157
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,958
<i>The wind should take me up there.</i>

158
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,252
<i>Please make it in time.</i>

159
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:36,897
