1
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,025
-Congratulations!
-Beautiful!

2
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,485
-Have a happy life!
-Congratulations!

3
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,654
-This is great.
-Congratulations!

4
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:36,703
<i>Hey.</i>

5
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:40,206
Was it really necessary
for us to be called out, too?

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,625
He's a major contributor

7
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,378
to the recovery
of this country after the war.

8
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:50,425
As an MP, he negotiated
the Venice Treaty and the EG Alliance.

9
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:55,054
After his retirement, he’s been active
as a consultant to the current King.

10
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,725
A staunch non-radical
and the most trusted person

11
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,852
living outside of the Royal Pala...

12
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,520
There’s just a lot to it.

13
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,615
<i>Quit your whining, ya rookie!</i>

14
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,244
So says Mr. Grumpus next to me.

15
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,162
Wh...

16
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:22,791
-On the inside.
-Hey!

17
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:27,337
I really don’t think I’m suited
for this kind of stuff.

18
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,632
Stop complaining. It's part of the job.

19
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:33,802
Boris, you said
that standing work is terrible.

20
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,721
Only I get to say whatever I want.

21
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,847
The hell is that?

22
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,099
More importantly,

23
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:43,561
that beard-spectacles is AWOL
while we're slogging away.

24
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,731
Now that you mention it,
I haven’t seen him lately.

25
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,900
What did he do this time?

26
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,528
He’s currently investigating
another case alone.

27
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,785
What do you mean by that?

28
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,205
A different case.

29
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,541
You have no idea, do you?

30
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,088
Well, whatever.

31
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,511
<i>Professor Genie is currently</i>
acting on his own without permission.

32
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,932
<i>I would like to ask the current members</i>
here to carry out their duties promptly.

33
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,644
<i>That's Genie for you, like always.</i>

34
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,147
<i>Huh, wonder where he went?</i>

35
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,566
<i>What? Seriously, no one knows?</i>

36
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,277
All of you, just shut your traps already.

37
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,296
Up in the sky, something's coming!

38
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,556
Start the car!

39
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,853
Wh-Who the hell are you?!

40
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,912
Wh-What is that?

41
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,288
Keep your head low!

42
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,708
It can’t be...

43
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,742
Mr. Zachary, are you alright?

44
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,786
Ugh, yeah.

45
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,625
Halt!

46
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,265
W-Wait.

47
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,685
Help me!

48
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,813
TWO DAYS EARLIER

49
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,858
How’s school?

50
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,862
It’s fun. Koku, is your repair job fun?

51
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,158
It’s not something
you would call fun, or whatever.

52
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,285
But it’s worth doing?

53
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,037
You could say that.

54
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,124
I’m off!

55
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,710
Hey Yuna, mornin’!

56
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,627
Morning!

57
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:40,298
Yuna, you did your homework, right?
Show me! Please!

58
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,259
No can do. You gotta do it yourself.

59
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,219
See? She sure told you.

60
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,813
Oh crap!

61
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,815
Oh crap!

62
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:58,983
Good morning.

63
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,234
-Morning!
-Bread?

64
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,487
Sorry! I’m running late!

65
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,790
Mom! Mom! I forgot my ID!

66
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,836
<i>What are you doing, you idiot!</i>

67
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,589
ROYAL POLICE - SEASIDE BRANCH

68
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,342
Good morning!

69
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,227
Still gone.

70
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,616
Kaela! I’ll treat you to lunch so...

71
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,120
Nope! Do that much by yourself, you moron!

72
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,122
Damn it!

73
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,749
Where’s Keith?

74
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,919
You’re late again.
Write a letter of apology.

75
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,921
Huh? But I made it on time.

76
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,799
Underlings must arrive
five minutes early. Idiot.

77
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,804
Are you nuts?

78
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,932
I finally made it halfway!

79
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,100
Where’s Keith?

80
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,935
Beats me.

81
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,014
Koku?

82
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:53,931
Yes?

83
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:57,727
Could you get me some cocobolo
from the storage room?

84
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,353
There should still be some left.

85
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,313
Yes.

86
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,615
Koku.

87
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,664
No way...

88
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,960
I told you we’d see each other
again soon, didn’t I, Koku?

89
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,379
Kirisame?

90
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:29,884
I’ve been searching for you all this time.
I’ve finally found you, Koku.

91
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,221
No... Killer B.

92
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,232
You were alive?

93
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,281
You saved me, didn’t you?

94
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,535
Then everyone else too?

95
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,544
What did he tell you?

96
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,254
Dr. Kazama.

97
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:12,009
<i>As he was dying, he said</i>
that if I exchanged a part of my body,

98
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,928
<i>I'd be able to save my friends.</i>

99
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,598
<i>That by saving my friends,</i>
I'd become stronger.

100
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,769
<i>That I'd get stronger and could protect</i>
my friends once more.

101
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,940
<i>He said that was my power and my mission.</i>

102
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,610
<i>And he handed you the note</i>
telling you which part to exchange.

103
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,113
But, no one woke up.

104
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,826
At that time, it would've taken more than
a week for the adhesion to regenerate.

105
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,372
Had you stayed by my side the whole time,
even with the resonance phenomena,

106
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,708
I might have been able to wake up sooner.

107
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,962
Koku.

108
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,674
Don’t you want to be together
with everyone again?

109
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,134
Like the old days?

110
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:01,058
We’re working at this national institute.

111
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,394
So we can create a new world.

112
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,358
It’s a future
where we can coexist with humans.

113
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,613
For that reason, first we need
to eliminate all those who are attached

114
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:18,117
to outdated technology like the Reggie.

115
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:23,331
It’s the New World.
In order to start it, we need to destroy.

116
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:29,295
Koku, we need your blade and your power.

117
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,423
Come with me. Let’s fight together.

118
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,718
A national institute?

119
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,929
Are you fretting over Gilbert Ross’s case?

120
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,182
Then you misunderstand.

121
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,434
That wasn’t the nation’s will.

122
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:49,607
Rather, it was part of a project
to make wild runaways destroy themselves.

123
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,737
In simple terms,
they only aided in Gilbert’s suicide.

124
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,950
You need a fire to stop a fire.

125
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,329
The quickest way to stop a runaway

126
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,457
is to make them pick up speed
and destroy themselves.

127
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:13,005
You and Keith Flick did more work
for us than I could’ve ever imagined.

128
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,800
You used me and Keith?

129
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,551
As a result.

130
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,054
But you reunited with Yuna, didn’t you?

131
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,768
I’m sorry.

132
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,398
To know that everyone is alive
is a joy beyond anything else.

133
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:35,653
I really am happy,
but my fight is already over.

134
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,614
I’ll return the blade. I can’t help you.

135
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,543
Koku.

136
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,214
Do you think the reason we were born
was because of Dr. Kazama’s will?

137
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:01,637
What would you do if the Black-winged King
was leading Dr. Kazama?

138
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,517
Koku, no one can run from their fate.

139
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,937
Not you, or us.

140
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,064
Kirisame.

141
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,449
Yukikaze. That’s Koku?

142
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,659
Don’t ever take your eyes off him.

143
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:26,162
Copy all his movements.

144
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,247
Even these ordinary ones?

145
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,206
What's the point?

146
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,500
Everything has meaning.

147
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,920
I don’t get it.
We should just kill him now.

148
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,965
You can’t. Not with how you are now.

149
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,050
Asagiri.

150
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:45,473
If you misjudge his progress then
he’ll become impossible for us to handle.

151
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,934
You’ll be making a real devil out of him.

152
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,564
The source of all failures in any era
is always carelessness.

153
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:58,027
And we definitely cannot afford to fail.

154
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,623
That’s what he said!

155
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:17,963
See you later!

156
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,215
-Buh-bye!
-Bye-bye!

157
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,037
Get back!

158
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,376
Where’s the ampoule?
This isn’t what they promised!

159
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,672
Damn it!

160
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,131
Has he made any demands?

161
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,592
-No, not yet.
-Hurry up, damn it!

162
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,178
They’re just sometimes shooting a gun.

163
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,682
Persuasion is meaningless, huh?

164
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,517
The assault team?

165
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,060
Arriving in five minutes.

166
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,937
Desire for recognition.

167
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,987
I’m done for. Hurry up and hand it over!

168
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,283
He’s seeking help from us.

169
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,244
Why are you barging in here like that?

170
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,787
Well, I’m a detective too.

171
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,997
Just get out of here!

172
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,124
Ah, behind you.

173
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,503
Aw geez.

174
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,522
Who had a shootout with who?

175
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,775
Nice to meet you, Keith Kazama.

176
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,077
Hey!

177
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,080
Lily! Huh?

178
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:18,751
A pretty young gal was walking about
so I picked her up.

179
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,628
I got picked up.

180
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,513
Weird crimes have been on the rise lately.

181
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,433
Lovely ladies like you
must be careful, Yuna.

182
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,935
Is something wrong?

183
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,436
Nothing's wrong.

184
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,104
Then something is wrong.

185
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,655
You were alive after all.

186
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,074
So you know who I am.

187
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,910
Kirisame.

188
00:15:54,745 --> 00:16:00,167
Is the increase in Reggie deaths
in the last few days your doing?

189
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:06,173
We’ve been given an order to dispose
all Reggies for restructuring.

190
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,424
From where?

191
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,179
I got it. Fine.

192
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,723
Troublesome as ever.

193
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,683
And?

194
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:21,480
What is it this time?
Can I assume that I’m still worth using?

195
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,816
You really are interesting.

196
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,276
Mhm, I get that a lot.

197
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,615
I appreciated your hard work every time.

198
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,242
Thanks a lot.

199
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:39,373
It’s true that I was the one
who left signs only you could understand

200
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,208
everywhere you went.

201
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,377
There's no way that Gilbert

202
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,588
in his last stages could've made
such an intricate design.

203
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,300
It was an incredibly
good piece of work, Kirisame.

204
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,680
Keith Kazama.
I’ve been meaning to ask you.

205
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,268
Why do you always show up
even when you know it's a trap?

206
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,645
Call it curiosity.

207
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:08,610
Those who kill God are to become devils.
Those who kill devils are to become Kings.

208
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:12,072
Hey, what do you think?

209
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:17,327
Am I the one being fooled by the stone?
Or is it you guys?

210
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,874
I think killing you
would be really regrettable.

211
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,333
It's no flattery.

212
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,836
But you will.

213
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,839
Who knows? Will I?

214
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:36,805
And when I was leaving my home,
I wasn’t wearing any pants.

215
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,224
So I backed up and went back home.

216
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,934
I noticed I was laying on my bed.

217
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,020
Of course I refused.

218
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,646
We’re not with them anymore.

219
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,565
You're really okay?

220
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:47,566
Yeah.

221
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,944
Be careful, Koku.

222
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,196
Yeah. You too, Yuna.

223
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,238
Right?

224
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,865
Isn't that funny?

225
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,118
Huh?

226
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,370
Hey, were you even listening?

227
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,539
I wasn't listening to a single word.

228
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,333
Huh?

229
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,045
Huh, when did you get one?

230
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,506
Wasn't it your policy not to have one?

231
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,965
A lot happened.

232
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,801
Hey, let’s exchange LINEs.

233
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,969
P-Please watch the road in front of you.

234
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,597
-It’s fine. I’ve three eyes--
-Watch out!

235
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,723
Lily!

236
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:30,484
There’s no water or food here.
It’s up to you when you die.

237
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,153
You say that with such ease.

238
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,949
I'd like you to accept that
as a sign of hostility.

239
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,703
I’ll tell you this now,
but he won’t make a move for my sake.

240
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:49,461
I’ve finally found something
you don’t comprehend.

241
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:56,677
To Koku, you’re Canopus.
An existence more important than Yuna.

242
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,429
There’s no way he won’t make a move.

243
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,934
The mechanism of love is the one thing
you really don’t seem to understand.

244
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:07,187
Pardon.

245
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:44,284
Wow, you're amazing.
You're more than what the rumors said.

246
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,245
I can’t imagine you’re that Koku.

247
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,624
Hey, long time no see.

248
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,501
Kazan.

249
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,711
Yukikaze.

250
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,631
It’s an honor that you remembered me.

251
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,882
Where’s Keith?

252
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,052
I’m having him rest in a special place.

253
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,389
It’s a great spot. Excellent ocean view.

254
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,517
If he had wings, it’d be a paradise.

255
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,560
What are you trying to make me do?

256
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,312
You're gonna help me with a job.

257
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,981
Job?

258
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,817
I refuse.

259
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,987
You’re fine with something happening
to Keith Flick?

260
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,072
Leave me alone.

261
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:24,866
Fine, but if he dies...

262
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:28,620
I’ll go after Yuna next.

263
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,542
-If you lay a hand on Yuna--
-Well, that's up to you.

264
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,876
Don't mock me!

265
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,921
If you don't accept,
then I'll kill Canopus.

266
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,632
He'll die in four days anyway
if you leave him be.

267
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:45,846
Next is Yuna.
Then Lily Hoshina. Her family.

268
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:50,267
Everyone you know will die.

269
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,352
Koku.

270
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:56,440
I’m going to have you kill God.

271
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:53,765
