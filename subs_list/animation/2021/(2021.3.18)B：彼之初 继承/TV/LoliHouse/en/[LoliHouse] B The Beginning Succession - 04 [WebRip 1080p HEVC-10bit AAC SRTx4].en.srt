1
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:16,683
How many ancient ruins exist?

2
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,312
There's a lot.
There's no time to go to each one.

3
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,772
We have to narrow them down.

4
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:25,275
Then, shouldn't it be a place where it has

5
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,986
the deepest connection
to the Black-winged King?

6
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,446
Kazan.

7
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:33,074
He said he was having him rest
in a special place.

8
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:34,617
A good place.

9
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:39,247
Near the ocean,
and a paradise if he had wings.

10
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,498
A paradise?

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,001
That's what he said.

12
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:50,508
The Four Towers built to protect
Jet Black's North, South, East, and West.

13
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:55,013
I heard it was a holy place connected
to the Black-winged King.

14
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,599
What about there?

15
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,897
It's that time already, huh?

16
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,286
There's brilliantly nothing here.

17
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,665
I guess it's no use after all.

18
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,543
I see. Kirisame's clever.

19
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,711
Hey.

20
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,966
Hey.

21
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:17,679
Hey! I know you can hear me, Keith Flick.

22
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,533
So I've stooped down to Gilbert's level.

23
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,744
It's come to that, huh?

24
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,165
Keith.

25
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,959
You haven't changed.

26
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,339
If my subconscious
is projecting an illusion,

27
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,551
this must be the endorphins
being released right before death.

28
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,177
Oh, well.

29
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,430
Are you okay?

30
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,265
Do I look okay?

31
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,267
Ouch.

32
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,271
Don't ignore me.

33
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,525
You're the same as ever.

34
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:16,821
Just give up.

35
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,330
I've dropped down to your level.

36
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,584
You finally answered me.

37
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,252
Shut up.

38
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,172
You still can't forgive me?

39
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,384
I thought that killing me
would make you feel better.

40
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,429
It feels like crap.

41
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,892
So, the one you can't forgive
is yourself, isn't it?

42
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,853
I was the one who killed Erika.

43
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,106
But the person who created the reason
behind that was you.

44
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,654
How troublesome.

45
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,155
What is?

46
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,824
You're my illusion, aren't you?

47
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,034
You could say that.

48
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,744
So you are me.

49
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,120
No doubt.

50
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,791
That would mean the you
who’s blaming me is me.

51
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:11,167
That's correct.

52
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,172
I'm an image of the shadow
from the deepest part of you.

53
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,758
That is what's troublesome.

54
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,178
Come on, after all these years.
You knew, didn't you?

55
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,349
You always did.

56
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,187
Keith.

57
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:36,234
There's something
I've always wanted to ask you.

58
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,235
Huh?

59
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,282
The reason you quit the research facility
and entered the police force.

60
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:46,286
Was it to distance yourself from me?

61
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,664
That's not the only reason.

62
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:53,251
But it was one of the reasons.

63
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,502
Yeah.

64
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,671
You could say that.

65
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,464
Why?

66
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,466
You understand, don't you?

67
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:07,849
I still remember the time you said you
were going to join the research facility.

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,352
That's when I realized.

69
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:15,148
That my feelings for her were growing.

70
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,403
No, I didn't realize.

71
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,825
And I had thought that she liked Gilbert.

72
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:36,044
You realized Erika's feelings for you,
yet you ran away.

73
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,341
You left the research facility
to keep yourself away from her.

74
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,221
That's right.

75
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:52,393
If I hadn't run away,
Erika would be alive.

76
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,649
The three of us might have
solved the case by now.

77
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,783
Not a chance. I'm done talking to you.
Hurry up and disappear.

78
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,662
That's up to you.

79
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:15,958
Your heart still yearns
for you to be condemned.

80
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:25,718
You wish to be tried for a sin
that no one knows about.

81
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,763
You can't erase those feelings of guilt.

82
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:40,650
You accept that this current situation
is an appropriate punishment.

83
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,570
Maybe you're right.

84
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,824
Then you shouldn't be allowed
to die, right?

85
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,538
If it's Keith Flick,

86
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:59,210
he'll use his head and think of a way
to get out of this place, right?

87
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,049
No use. There’s a limit to all things.

88
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,595
There’s nothing here, is there?

89
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,765
Then will you die in this place?

90
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,979
Will you run away again?

91
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,584
Keith, you're an idiot.

92
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:53,431
You were the only one who'd ever say
I'm an idiot to my face.

93
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,850
Well, I am an idiot.

94
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,395
I couldn't say it either.

95
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,189
We're the same.

96
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,361
Gilbert was kind.

97
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,826
He forgave all of me.

98
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,537
I let him spoil me.

99
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,665
I could talk to him about anything.

100
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,919
That's why I told him.

101
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,588
That I love you, Keith.

102
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:30,092
And I would tell you because
I didn't want to have regrets.

103
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:36,641
That was the only thing
he didn't forgive me for.

104
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,607
Keith. My last words were...

105
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,529
Keith, listen.

106
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,283
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,250
Please disappear.

108
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,506
I won't allow you to run away.

109
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,938
I've etched an indelible code into you.

110
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,275
I'll continue to live alongside you.

111
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,488
We'll always be together.

112
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,910
I know!

113
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:44,375
If I didn't run from myself,
you wouldn't have had to die.

114
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:50,965
I didn't want you to see me
as such a failure!

115
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:55,261
I loved you.

116
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:00,725
I wanted you
to always be smiling at my side.

117
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,107
I knew that I wasn't good
at expressing my emotions either.

118
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,942
But...

119
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:16,532
I was afraid putting it into words
would make everything fall apart!

120
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,828
Because I am your brother!

121
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,833
And an older brother shouldn't...

122
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,213
hold such feelings for his little sister!

123
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,302
They're supposed to protect them...

124
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,474
and they shouldn't have such feelings.

125
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,148
And even though I fell in love with you,
I couldn't even protect you.

126
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,488
I'm...

127
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,407
such a hopeless fool.

128
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,661
Keith.

129
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,624
If I just die,
will I be able to see you again?

130
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,960
Could I stay with you forever?

131
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:15,549
Keith, don't forget your promise.

132
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,218
Promise?

133
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:24,016
<i>-Keith... Keith... Keith...</i>
-Keith... Keith... Keith...

134
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,523
<i>-Keith... Keith... Keith...</i>
-Keith... Keith... Keith...

135
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,608
<i>Keith.</i>

136
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:38,572
Keith, I found a devastatingly
good bakery! Let's go next week!

137
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,205
Crap, I forgot.

138
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,504
How troublesome.

139
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:02,596
I forgot that I had to be alive
next Tuesday.

140
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,975
Keith is in one of these.

141
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,270
But which one?

142
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,533
I guess I can't hope for any more
information to narrow it down.

143
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:23,659
Lily.

144
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,660
Oh well.

145
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,038
All we can do now
is go there and confirm.

146
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,210
We'll keep in touch as we continue
to gather information.

147
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:38,132
Usually, we'd go to the Royal Palace,
but right now...

148
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,676
Don't be so courteous. I'll go with you.

149
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,720
That would be dangerous.

150
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,431
Let me see this through to the end.

151
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,310
Understood.

152
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:54,190
Everyone will split up
and investigate the four towers.

153
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:57,526
Koku, you'll go to these two areas.

154
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:01,614
Yuna and Izanami, you'll go here.

155
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:08,412
And I'll take this last one.

156
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,291
Your Majesty, please come with me.

157
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,170
I think it's dangerous to split up.

158
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:20,132
Got any quicker ways to confirm?

159
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,260
Roger.

160
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,763
All right. Let's go!

161
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,706
Well, good enough.

162
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,475
I'll be able to buy half a day with this.

163
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,521
Now then.

164
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,235
Let's get to it.

165
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,531
Now then.

166
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,784
Everyone! Be careful out there!

167
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,048
Koku and the others are on the move.

168
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,717
Finally.

169
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,553
Where's Asagiri?

170
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,392
All movements have already been captured.
It's completely finished.

171
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,730
That means she's become
more powerful than him.

172
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,861
Numerically speaking, yes.

173
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,366
If it's correct, the probability is high.

174
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,952
We'll let her attack
and watch the results.

175
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,914
Aw, man. I wanted to see it.

176
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:15,915
Kazan.

177
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,125
Yeah, yeah, I know.

178
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,295
Hurry it up.

179
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:24,131
We should just keep RIS waiting.

180
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,925
Don't say that.

181
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,260
They're our important comrades, too.

182
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,887
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,033
This is bad.

184
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,744
My head's all muddled up.

185
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:59,708
If I'm wrong, I'll die for sure.

186
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,547
I guess I can't help that either.

187
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,349
Is there a problem?

188
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,977
It's too slow.

189
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,146
What should we do?

190
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,191
Do you mind if we use a shortcut?

191
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:25,651
Not at all.

192
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,903
Well then.

193
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,495
Are you all right, Your Majesty?

194
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,873
I'm going to speed up a little.

195
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,599
That one looks good.

196
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,189
Is it all right to just use it?

197
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,275
I'm sure it's fine.

198
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,487
Can you drive it?

199
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,530
Probably.

200
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,451
I'm happy to see you again.

201
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,870
What's with you all of a sudden?

202
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,542
Because I never got to tell you.

203
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,593
W-Were you in contact with Koku?

204
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,636
Somewhat.

205
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,351
I got to see him sometimes.

206
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,854
What? Really?

207
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:47,066
What? He didn't tell you?

208
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,110
No. Can you tell me more details?

209
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,112
Perhaps another time.

210
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,989
Hey!

211
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,450
That much with that thing, huh?

212
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,620
The problem doesn't seem to be the size.

213
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,455
It's how fast it flies out.

214
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,168
Now then.

215
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,671
The falling speed. Insufficient.

216
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,507
I send down the rope.
There's not enough distance.

217
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,009
I'll use a pulley. Don't have one.

218
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,011
Something I can use as a substitute.

219
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,685
There's loads of them.

220
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:17,739
Next.

221
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,340
We're almost at our destination.

222
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,340
Finally found you.

223
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,301
Kazan.

224
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,313
That must be it.

225
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,496
