1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,224
Psychic Beast!

2
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,644
She's been hypnotized
into opening the door!

3
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,773
-Hold it off, Raiga.
-On it.

4
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,775
-Edgar, the walls!
-Roger that.

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>Rayloca sladseld.</i>

6
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,583
Magic sealers!

7
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:44,544
Kuroki can't use magic
until we take them down!

8
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,962
If we lose track of them, it's over!

9
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,589
Get them!

10
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,382
I'll leave this to you.

11
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,427
-Wow.
-Wow.

12
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,429
It's not looking good, Uncle.

13
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,141
You're right about that.
Without magical enhancements,

14
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:02,729
<i>I score two or three in gym class.</i>
<i>I'm basically a useless log.</i>

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,649
<i>Two or three out of what?</i>

16
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,445
<i>The teachers saw his efforts</i>
<i>and spared him the lowest grade.</i>

17
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,614
<i>Things sure change, Edgar.</i>

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,951
We're no longer those crybabies
in need of his cuddles.

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,665
The man's got a scary face,
but we trained to be strong like him.

20
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,834
That's--

21
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,295
-They're talking about you!
-What?

22
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,172
They really admire you!

23
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,174
Huh? What? Really?

24
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,843
His strength is unmatched.

25
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,264
Oh, cut it out--

26
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,434
<i>Gigant hunter Doldor Rexdor!</i>

27
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,361
Sorry, wrong guy.

28
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,238
I'm so sorry, Uncle.

29
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,161
I need to go use the restroom.

30
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,915
You two keep watching.

31
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,504
<i>Also, we can't let Kuroki</i>
<i>outperform us again.</i>

32
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,299
<i>You got that right.</i>
<i>Kuroki is a great fighter too.</i>

33
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,717
<i>He's a bit odd though.</i>

34
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,470
Uncle!

35
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,180
Hey, Uncle! They're praising you--

36
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,182
Enough!

37
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,434
Watch without me!

38
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:26,938
-<i>Uncle!</i>
-<i>I'm so sorry, Uncle.</i>

39
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,232
{\an8}UNCLE:
YOU'RE FINE THE WAY YOU ARE

40
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,140
GET HOME

41
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,396
SOLD CHEAPER THAN A SCOURING PAD

42
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,910
He won't come out.

43
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,286
Will he be okay?

44
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,789
I believe in him.

45
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,375
He'll get through it.

46
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,834
You're right.

47
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,671
So let's believe in him and keep watching!

48
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:18,132
Hurry, start it. What happens next?

49
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,217
You…

50
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:34,065
Let's see, wind, fire and ice.
Let's go with this order.

51
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,618
{\an8}DEAD?

52
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,788
-<i>Uncle!</i>
-<i>He's alive!</i>

53
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,789
<i>Good one.</i>

54
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,378
-Uncle!
-That's gotta hurt!

55
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,350
<i>He's fine.</i>

56
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,436
Who was behind the attack?

57
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,105
-That was Elf.
-Uncle.

58
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,024
Are you better already?

59
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,567
Of course I am.

60
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,111
That was Elf's newest weapon.

61
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,363
The scabbard she left in a hurry to grab.

62
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,906
Wait, the scabbard?

63
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,828
Heavy projectile mode.

64
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,998
How useful.

65
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,420
Glasses! Ponytail!

66
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,505
The scabbard is cool, but why the glasses?

67
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,382
They're an ancient magical relic too.

68
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:47,388
Not that way, orc face. Over there.

69
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,015
Dummy.

70
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,103
I said this way. He ran off!

71
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,689
-Perhaps because she's royalty…
-<i>Don't run.</i>

72
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,567
-…she hunts humans for sport.
-<i>Crap, I lost you!</i>

73
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,195
-Elf is being unkind.
-<i>You sneaky little--</i>

74
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,614
-So, what's the deal with those birds?
-<i>Don't do this to me.</i>

75
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,075
Being able to block magic
is quite a power.

76
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,243
They told me this later.

77
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,621
<i>Those birds' breath</i>

78
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:15,416
<i>contains magical properties</i>
<i>that inhibit the spirits' activities.</i>

79
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,585
<i>Wow, so that's how it works.</i>

80
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,504
<i>Suits the fantasy setting.</i>

81
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,756
<i>No. The spirits are more like,</i>

82
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,676
<i>"Smelly birds! Don't put us to work."</i>

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,470
I see.

84
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,013
They have halitosis.

85
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,974
<i>Regsuuid zaldohna.</i>

86
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,190
The spirits are saying,
"It's still stinky! Nope, not gonna work!"

87
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,859
<i>Those birds have</i>
<i>a terrible case of halitosis.</i>

88
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,028
<i>Spirits are pretty stubborn.</i>

89
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,908
<i>After that, I joined Alicia</i>
<i>and the others.</i>

90
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,868
No!

91
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,457
<i>Everyone's hypnotized!</i>

92
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,598
-Alicia.
-Kuroki!

93
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,975
You got burned!

94
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,269
Lord, grant us healing light!

95
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,353
Thanks.

96
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,151
Can't your wand undo the hypnotism?

97
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,360
Not possible!

98
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:28,865
The wand may be powerful, but divine magic
is for healing the body and spirit!

99
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,994
It's ineffective against overwhelming
brute force. I said so!

100
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,288
There's no activation button on it?

101
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,623
Elf's sword has a special function.

102
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,250
There's no button.

103
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,127
What if we twist this part?

104
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,045
What?

105
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,687
Kuroki, what are you--

106
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,899
This light-- It's harmless.

107
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,401
Looks like it, yeah.

108
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,613
Is this the wand's area of effectiveness?

109
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,949
Alicia, try to undo the hypnotism again.

110
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,201
Okay, I'll try.

111
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,079
It's just, this magic--

112
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:22,293
It cures altered states by synching
my tranquil mind with the targets'.

113
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,962
What? I can't hear you.

114
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:29,050
Please don't stare at me so closely.

115
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,218
Oh, sorry.

116
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,637
You can't cast magic like this.

117
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,731
Oh, Lord.

118
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,318
Let the hearts of those
who wander in darkness

119
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,111
become one with mine.

120
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,332
What was I doing?

121
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:02,833
Hypnotized…

122
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,669
We did it, Kuroki!

123
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,547
Alicia!

124
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,009
Ashura Steel Fist!

125
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,305
That's my skill!

126
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,273
-Alicia!
-Are you hurt?

127
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,191
Huh? What did I…

128
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,694
Uncle. What just happened?

129
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,738
The wand enhanced Alicia's spell
and gave her additional powers.

130
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,242
Alicia can now use the abilities
of her synched allies.

131
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:42,498
Something about divine powers
boosts skills even more.

132
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,583
No way.

133
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,334
She's turning into a real hero.

134
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,841
You won't get away.

135
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,935
This is bad. Flaming Hell Beasts!

136
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:04,645
We're outnumbered.

137
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,488
They're easy to trap.
They charge headfirst.

138
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:20,411
Good grief. Finally.

139
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,040
<i>Rayloca mivald bagl hild.</i>

140
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:33,591
The spirit of water here
is boiling with rage.

141
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,926
Brace yourselves.

142
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,363
<i>Bagluuid.</i>

143
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,038
What?

144
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:14,715
Great.

145
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,926
We did it!

146
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,138
I can't thank you enough.

147
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,475
-That was incredible, great hero!
-It was nothing.

148
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,560
-Train from the basics again.
-Yeah.

149
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,522
Mister!

150
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,650
Sorry I got scared of you earlier.

151
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,946
It really was nothing--

152
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,615
I patched up the holes in the walls
with a barrier for now.

153
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,742
Make sure the baths look good.

154
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,999
An impressive open view.

155
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,045
A "have a drink while watching the sunset"
package will make us rich!

156
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,797
Fantastic! We'll be filthy rich!

157
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,009
Man, this barrier is crazy strong.

158
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,387
How'd you manage to cast
something this powerful?

159
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,889
I put up a huge barrier once.

160
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,100
That experience came in handy.

161
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:11,564
Yes! Finally, a competitive edge
to our outdated and boring inn!

162
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,940
That's terrible, Lenia.

163
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,611
That's what you think about our inn!

164
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,656
You're not wrong, Lenia.

165
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,909
And that's a wrap for this incident.

166
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,079
It all worked out in the end. I'm glad.

167
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:32,543
Wait. I thought you got in trouble
for erasing memories.

168
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,712
Oh, right.

169
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:39,592
After the battle, I went for another soak.

170
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,927
-Skip it.
-Skip it.

171
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,220
Oh, okay.

172
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,931
<i>Hello.</i>

173
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,854
<i>I forgot to tell you I was coming in.</i>

174
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:56,358
The beasts burned down the fencing
separating the men's and women's springs.

175
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,943
Back to fast-forwarding.

176
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,403
-Don't!
-Don't!

177
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,907
STRIKING WATER SERPENTS

178
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,452
Kuroki.

179
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,121
I'm covered.

180
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,585
Oh, good.

181
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,256
What, you thought I'd join you naked?

182
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,844
It's a hot spring, so yeah.

183
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,805
No way.

184
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,309
<i>Icuras cuora.</i>

185
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,685
-That was fast!
-That was fast!

186
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,646
-Uncle?
-Uncle?

187
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,941
No, I wasn't looking at anything dirty…

188
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,360
I know. Your memory must've flashed back.

189
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,197
No one in real life suffers nosebleeds
after seeing a dirty image.

190
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,493
Thanks. I was caught off guard.

191
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:52,081
The memory I erased
was about seeing Alicia's naked body.

192
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,877
Sorry. You didn't want to see that.

193
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,798
What? Well…

194
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,385
Yeah, I know.

195
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:08,264
You wouldn't be interested
in a young girl like me.

196
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,308
Are you that young? I'm 20.

197
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,978
Are you, now. What?

198
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,982
We're the same age?
You're not in your thirties?

199
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,901
I only just turned 20.

200
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,407
When's your birthday?
I was an August baby.

201
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,616
I was born in November.

202
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,206
I'm older?

203
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,335
<i>Alicia is older than Uncle.</i>

204
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,796
<i>I'm with her.</i>
<i>I wouldn't believe it either.</i>

205
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,800
But I may have been born in another month.

206
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,385
What do you mean?

207
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:53,267
I can't remember anything
from before I turned nine.

208
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,689
Kuroki, can you project my memory?

209
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,775
-August, 11 years ago.
-Yeah.

210
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:03,903
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

211
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:11,744
<i>My first memories are</i>
<i>of seeing blood and a carriage.</i>

212
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,957
<i>I was getting taken away</i>
<i>in a carriage by goblins.</i>

213
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,629
<i>I was saved by knights from the village</i>
<i>Edgar and Raiga are from.</i>

214
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:27,968
<i>Maybe because I hit my head,</i>
<i>I can't recall anything from before then.</i>

215
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,136
WE LOVE YOU
HAPPY 10TH BIRTHDAY

216
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,555
<i>All I had was this piece of paper.</i>

217
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,392
<i>We never found my family.</i>

218
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,229
<i>They were most likely</i>
<i>killed by the goblins.</i>

219
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,985
<i>I was named Alicia by the priestess</i>
<i>in charge of Edelcia's outskirts.</i>

220
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,446
<i>They took me in and raised me.</i>

221
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,532
And here we are now.

222
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:57,790
So my birthday may not be in August.

223
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,043
Alicia, are memories important to you?

224
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,671
Huh? Of course they are.

225
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,341
Since I can't recall any of my childhood,
I've treasured all my experiences since!

226
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:10,344
I erased your memory. Twice.

227
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,973
Huh? Are you trying to be funny?

228
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,852
I can cast <i>icuras cuora</i>.
It's a memory obliteration spell.

229
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,896
Memory

230
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,357
obliteration.

231
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,368
Why? I--

232
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,542
Kuroki, which of my memories
did you erase?

233
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,877
Be warned, you'll get nosebleeds.

234
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:44,962
Nosebleeds?

235
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,506
The first memory I erased

236
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,843
was when we won against
the goblin horde on Mount Dordo.

237
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:56,682
The second time was when we attacked
the Labyrinth of Depths via the back door.

238
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,188
So the goblin mission,

239
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,025
becoming a crusader,
earning my title as a hero--

240
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,068
That was all you, Kuroki. Not me.

241
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,529
I'm nothing special.

242
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:14,366
At the Sealed City, you fixed the barrier
and didn't tell a soul!

243
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,620
These are all actions of a legendary hero!

244
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,456
You saw me do that?

245
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,625
You can disclose the truth.
I'll go somewhere far away.

246
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,003
What are you saying? I don't understand.

247
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,214
It was I who undid that barrier.

248
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:37,389
Why would you do such a thing?

249
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,308
It was out of curiosity.

250
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,101
Kuroki,

251
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,190
you wouldn't risk people's lives
without a sound reason.

252
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,612
I come from a different world.

253
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:56,992
I'm from Japan Bahamal.
Murayama came from the same place.

254
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,452
You're from there too?

255
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,454
My goal is to go back to my world.

256
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,415
That's why
I slammed my strongest offensive magic

257
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,459
<i>against the thick barrier wall.</i>

258
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,215
<i>I was looking for clues in the time warp</i>
<i>caused by the impact.</i>

259
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,302
I ended up only shattering that barrier.

260
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,306
You wanted to do what Psychic Beast did.

261
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,851
You tried to create a tunnel
between your world and ours.

262
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,978
In essence, yes.

263
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:30,025
You erased only those two memories, right?

264
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,568
Yeah. No more.

265
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,989
Don't ever cast this spell again!

266
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,574
On yourself or others!

267
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,494
It's for survival's sake.
If I need to, I'll use it.

268
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:41,912
Kuroki!

269
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,459
I don't want to forget you!

270
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:50,671
And I don't want you to forget me!

271
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,225
All right.

272
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,396
I won't use the memory obliteration spell
on you ever again.

273
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,856
That's not enough.

274
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,609
I won't erase my memories of you either.

275
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,319
Happy now?

276
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,490
It's a promise, got that?

277
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,992
Okay.

278
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,912
Great.

279
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,248
Let's shake on it.

280
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh, but--

281
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,918
What is it now?

282
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:33,172
This explains why you were scribbling
and mumbling just now.

283
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,050
Again? Did I erase another memory?
What was it?

284
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,011
It's nothing. Just my nake--

285
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,846
I'll recall it. Show me what you did.

286
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,057
It wasn't a big deal. It's fine!

287
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,310
No! We made a promise.

288
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,437
I won't erase any of my memories of you.

289
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,315
-It was only a glance.
-Glance? What did I get a glance of?

290
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,276
Oh, well, fine.

291
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,653
Can you keep your eyes closed?

292
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,738
Huh? All right.

293
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,551
What?

294
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,721
Unbelievable.
She shot through this barrier!

295
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,270
Kuroki!

296
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,156
He's younger than me.

297
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:46,620
Beasts attacked, Alicia grew furious
and Elf tried to hunt me down.

298
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,749
More like Hell Springs
than Purgatory Springs. Good heavens.

299
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,669
<i>What do I call him?</i>

300
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,381
<i>Tenma? Or do I keep calling him Kuroki?</i>

301
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,845
I wonder if Uncle's got screws loose
from getting rid of too many memories.

302
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,930
I know.

303
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,475
Uncle, go easy on erasing your memories.

304
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,396
Yeah. Earlier, you erased one again
in the bathroom.

305
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,273
-No, I didn't.
-What?

306
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,985
But you looked oddly refreshed.

307
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,946
You're misunderstanding.
That wasn't magic.

308
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,864
It was a technique
for killing my emotions.

309
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,412
Say what?

310
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,081
Theoretically speaking,
even if you go through hell,

311
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,209
nothing can bother you
if you don't feel the pain.

312
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,544
That's what I was doing.

313
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:38,255
I killed off my feelings
before things took a toll.

314
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,758
You'll have many chances to do the same
when you hit middle age,

315
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,261
so take the time to practice
while you're young.

316
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:46,471
No, thanks. Right, Takafumi?

317
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,057
He's right. If I don't feel a thing…

318
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,476
Good.

319
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,979
-Good. It's working.
-Stop!

320
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,188
<i>The Great Recession.</i>

321
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,898
-Good start.
-<i>Lost 20 years.</i>

322
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,651
-Now, empty your heart even more.
-<i>I've had my fair share of troubles.</i>

323
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,986
It's a handy skill.

324
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,404
Takafumi, stop!

325
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,740
<i>No matter what happens to me from now on…</i>

326
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,908
-Stop! Don't do this!
-<i>…I think I can overcome it…</i>

327
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,453
-Come back to us, Takafumi!
-<i>…with this skill.</i>

328
