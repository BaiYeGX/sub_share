1
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:08,341
{\an8}I am the destined hero,
the Shining Crusader.

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,429
Alicia Edelcia, a divine hero.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,893
{\an8}Ouch! What's that for?

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,397
{\an8}Don't stick the sword in the ground.
We just bought it.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,481
{\an8}Sorry.

6
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,442
Oh, no! It's nicked!

7
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,988
{\an8}My Hellshredder Zwei!

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,240
{\an8}You liked it so much
that you gave it a name?

9
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,616
I am so sorry, Edgar!

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,536
That's the legendary hero and her party.

11
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,620
<i>She's groveling.</i>

12
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,540
<i>I didn't want to see the hero</i>
<i>groveling on the ground.</i>

13
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,668
<i>So you guys are the heroes.</i>

14
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,504
<i>Have you been heroes</i>
<i>since the Overwinter Festival?</i>

15
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:50,508
<i>No. We are new to adventuring.</i>
<i>We've been out for less than six months.</i>

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,260
What? They are beginners!

17
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,388
Such rookies!
How can they call themselves heroes?

18
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:56,973
May I?

19
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,684
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

20
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:07,150
<i>Who slayed the goblin hordes?</i>

21
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:12,155
<i>Who smote the forces</i>
<i>threatening our kingdom?</i>

22
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,365
<i>Yes! Praise be!</i>

23
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:17,243
<i>Witness the birth of legendary heroes!</i>

24
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,455
<i>But I don't even…</i>

25
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,916
<i>Remember a thing from then.</i>

26
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:26,002
<i>Our heroes, give us a word!</i>

27
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:27,337
<i>Well…</i>

28
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,257
<i>-Let the Lord's hand guide your path.</i>
<i>-The hell?</i>

29
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:36,012
Alicia's party got credit,
though Uncle defeated the monsters.

30
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,599
It feels weird watching a screen
within a screen, though.

31
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,602
I see. That's why
you were ordained as heroes.

32
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,187
What is this magic?

33
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,732
Excuse me.

34
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,576
Kuroki, it was you who resealed
the barrier in Luvaldram, the Sealed City…

35
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,495
ALICIA'S ARC - FIN

36
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,663
<i>No.</i>

37
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,957
<i>It wasn't you, was it?</i>

38
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,795
I know the trouble that comes
with unwanted fame.

39
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,005
It's our little secret, okay?

40
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:17,178
<i>And that's how I ended up joining</i>
<i>Alicia's party for a while.</i>

41
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,680
Found it!

42
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,557
The Labyrinth of Depths!

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,851
Finally, I can keep my childhood promise.

44
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,895
This dungeon's that special to you?

45
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:29,065
Yes. Since we were suddenly
ordained as heroes,

46
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,486
the Adventurer Guild granted us permission
to delve into this A-level dungeon.

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,196
-Let me see your memory.
-Hey!

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,698
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

49
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,534
<i>Oh, no! My Sparkling Wand!</i>

50
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,994
<i>Don't cry, Alicia.</i>

51
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,289
<i>I promise I'll get you</i>
<i>the legendary Wand of Salvation someday.</i>

52
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,668
<i>Yes. We'll find it in</i>
<i>the Labyrinth of Depths when we are older.</i>

53
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,672
Wow! What's this? We're adorable!

54
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,674
-Shut--
-Up.

55
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,760
Ouch! That hurt!

56
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,305
I'm older than you guys.

57
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,683
Back then, both of you followed me around
like baby ducks!

58
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,686
You were so reckless,
we couldn't leave you unsupervised.

59
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:09,981
You'd wander into bears' dens
and almost fall off cliffs.

60
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:13,109
Without us, you'd be dead twice over.

61
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,485
How rude!

62
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,778
<i>I see.</i>

63
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,495
-Hold it.
-What is it?

64
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,789
<i>Bahamalion slad larch.</i>

65
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,380
<i>Regsuuld stagga.</i>

66
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,592
<i>Stagga magna.</i>

67
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,566
Oh, is that it?

68
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,654
Looks like this route goes
straight to the end of the dungeon.

69
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,241
Here you are. Lucky you.

70
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,909
Oh, thanks.

71
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,495
-Yay.
-Hooray.

72
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,207
Oops. My bad.

73
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,084
<i>Icuras cuora.</i>

74
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,887
Why are you doing this?

75
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,431
<i>Icuras cuora.</i>

76
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,850
Wait, Uncle.

77
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,560
Seriously, what was that for?

78
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:34,816
These three wanted to clear the dungeon
and obtain the wand fair and square.

79
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:39,195
But what I did was like using
a cheat code to spoil the ending.

80
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,863
<i>Why are you dragging them?</i>

81
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:45,076
<i>And so, the four of us started over</i>
<i>and explored the dungeon properly.</i>

82
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,040
The Wand of Salvation, at last!

83
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:56,462
That turned out great.

84
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:00,174
I got nervous
when Uncle deleted their memory.

85
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,637
Wait!

86
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,056
Why are you trying to erase
their memory again?

87
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,979
I thought their true ending should've been
that they got the wand without help.

88
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,691
I tried to erase the memory
of my assistance.

89
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,152
It's beautiful.

90
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,240
Thank you.

91
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,160
Edgar, Raiga and…

92
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,538
Kuroki.

93
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,378
What the four of us accomplished today,

94
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,506
I'll never forget it as long as I live.

95
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,633
You are right.

96
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,261
It was quite the adventure, wasn't it?

97
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,015
I see.

98
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,811
Hey, where are you going?

99
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,565
I have business in the king's capital.
I have to get going.

100
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:01,069
Really? We haven't even split the reward
for hunting down that hedgehog yet.

101
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,779
I'll get my share next time.

102
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,572
Huh? The next time?

103
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,574
Then at least please keep these.

104
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,162
These are healing spell cards.

105
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,626
Just thought we'd share.

106
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,463
Oh, yeah? These will be helpful.

107
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:22,965
Thank you.

108
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,557
So it went like that.

109
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,314
That was kinda cool.

110
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,233
Uncle, you were so cool!

111
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:45,071
Yes. You have to be cool as a cucumber
when you're a professional fighter.

112
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,992
I learned that
from <i>Shinrei Jusatsushi TAROMARU</i>.

113
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,786
<i>Here you go again.</i>

114
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,163
<i>He'd be much cooler if he didn't do this.</i>

115
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,543
Don't you think it's hotter than usual?

116
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,044
The sun's glaring too.

117
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,879
You think so?

118
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:07,051
It's true that I haven't been in a room
without AC in the summer for a long time.

119
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:11,973
But junior high and high school classrooms
don't even have fans installed.

120
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,226
Huh? We had ACs in my classroom.

121
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,310
{\an8}VARIES BY REGION

122
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,812
{\an8}-Right?
-Yeah.

123
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,731
{\an8}Seriously? When I was a young man…

124
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:25,945
I didn't expect you to be complaining
about "kids nowadays."

125
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,114
You probably got corporal punishment
back then too.

126
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,825
Yes. Every day,
some kid was beaten by the teachers.

127
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:31,909
That often?

128
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:36,789
Now teachers can still intimidate you
without even putting hands on you.

129
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,963
Enough depressing talk. Tell us
about your journey to the royal capital.

130
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:45,381
Oh, you want me to?

131
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,675
Then <i>icuras elran</i>.

132
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,093
Here we go!

133
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,430
<i>Takafumi may be using these stories</i>
<i>from Another World as an escape.</i>

134
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,184

<i>like his parents' divorce in 10th grade.</i>

135
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,186
{\an8}THANK YOU FOR WATCHING

136
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,398
Vile orc!
You won't get anything out of me!

137
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,861
I've no business with you.

138
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,780
<i>Icuras slad larch.</i>

139
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,867
Captain!

140
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,494
I see.

141
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,206
It's the Church
that has the power to ordain heroes.

142
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,210
It's Bishop Zernegan who decides
who's nominated for ordination.

143
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:26,881
At this moment, he's in a furtive meeting
with the commander of the royal army.

144
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,884
You knave!

145
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,428
Thanks for the tip-off.

146
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,639
<i>War-grent sladseld.</i>

147
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:47,944
-Why did you go to the king's capital?
-To discuss Alicia's party's situation.

153

{\an8}But--

154
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:09,257
In times of crisis, the military budget
increases. Take the money from there.

155
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,468
{\an8}And we are in a crisis
that's cost heroes their lives.

{\an8}When I heard reports about the heroes
delving into that dangerous dungeon,

157

{\an8}<i>So that's it?</i>

159

Incite a crisis and feather your own nest
with the increase to the defense budget.

161

<i>Adventurers?</i>

<i>Yes, but they are novices</i>
<i>and lack the experience for this mission.</i>

169
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,966
<i>Send an official order</i>
<i>to those three adventurers:</i>

170
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,802
<i>"Defeat ten goblins."</i>

171
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,431
I see.

172
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,392
From the beginning, you intended on
sacrificing them as pawns.

173
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:05,771
They became adventurers of their own will,
risking their own lives.

174
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,900
I merely had them perform their duties.
Is there a problem with that?

175
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,737
Who is he to act so indignant?

176
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:17,366
Indeed, they are adventurers
who put their lives on the line.

177
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,746
But since they survived, he tried
to throw them right back into danger.

178
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,083
It's an insult to the spirit of people
willing to lay down their lives.

179
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,377
And that's something I cannot forgive.

180
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,757
<i>This must be</i>

181
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,051
<i>the unrivaled power of modern morality!</i>

182
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,138
<i>A one-sided beatdown</i>
<i>using modern moral concepts to teach</i>

183
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:43,184
<i>the people of Another World a lesson</i>
<i>about their medieval idea of civil rights!</i>

184
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,146
<i>This is… something worth fighting for!</i>

185
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,607
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>"Is there a problem with that"?</i>

186
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,110
<i>Well-- It's just-- It's not fair, I think.</i>

187
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,362
Uncle!

188
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,865
I was barely 20
and never even held a part-time job.

189
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:02,119
How was I supposed to hold out against
an adult with such an executive-like aura?

190
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,412
<i>Commander!</i>

191
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,705
<i>Blasted orc!</i>

192
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,040
To the commander's aid!

193
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:07,833
Capture him!

194
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,295
<i>Zacktorla katluf.</i>

195
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,426
This is--

196
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,053
-A protean magic.
-Move back!

197
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,764
The situation was more
than I could handle.

198
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,226
I got through it by transforming
into the most powerful being I know.

199
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,229
<i>The most powerful? What could it be?</i>

200
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,074
-<i>Huh?</i>
-<i>Who's that?</i>

201
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,575
-Huh?
-Who's that?

202
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,328
Don't panic.

203
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,372
It's just another orc variant.

204
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,838
Watch your trap, twerp!

205
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,217
Seriously, who is he?

206
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,554
It's Mr. Tabuchi,
my eighth-grade homeroom teacher.

207
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,013
How should we know that?

208
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,558
Mr. Tabuchi's debate skill was undefeated.

209
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,727
<i>He was a terrifying monster,</i>
<i>so I borrowed his power.</i>

210
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,939
What are you--

211
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,442
Stop this farce--

212
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,987
<i>Zip it and listen up!</i>

213
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,156
Yes, sir.

214
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,616
-See, totally out-debated.
-Out-debated?

215
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,827
Enough!

216
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,371
Indeed, the commander acted cruelly.

217
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,124
You see, 11 years ago,
there was a village--

218
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:35,087
-No more, Grayler.
-No. My homeland was destroyed by goblins.

219
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:40,050
<i>I said, shut it and listen up!</i>

220
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,011
Yes, sir.

221
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,388
And just like that,
it shut them up immediately.

222
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,140
<i>Ultimate rhetorical power.</i>

223
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,476
<i>This is the power of '90s schoolteachers.</i>

224
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,352
Are you satisfied?

225
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:54,106
This doesn't change the fact that
our kingdom requires a bigger war chest.

226
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:57,860
Starting from the slaying
of the venom dragon three years ago,

227
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,738
bizarre incidents have arisen
in various regions.

228
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:05,659
Even the Blaze Dragon was defeated,
and Luvaldram was almost destroyed.

229
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,745
And now, this mass-scale
goblin horde advancement.

230
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:12,500
An unknown entity must be plotting
to upend the order of this world.

231
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,668
<i>-We have no other way!</i>
-He's talking about you, Uncle.

232
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,171
You've caused this mess.

233
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,339
Yeah, I know.

234
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:23,219
<i>Even with Mr. Tabuchi's violent ways,</i>
<i>I couldn't manage another slap.</i>

235
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:28,682
She's here!

236
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:31,477
The protector and torchbearer
told in legends.

237
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,189
The god-freezing sleeping beauty,
Mabel Rayveil.

238
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:39,610
Drown in the icy blade and sleep.

239
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,327
Go home!

240
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,955
THE GRAND EARTH
RUN AND STRIDE WITH HASTE

241
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,502
Sorry to interrupt. Show me the rest.

242
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,170
All righty.

243
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,468
<i>Raybelio yuul elran!</i>

244
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,429
<i>Raybelio yuul elran.</i>

245
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,241
What speed! Give it to him, Mabel!

246
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,576
Guardian knight!

247
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,332
Two friends drawing swords
against one another.

248
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,251
That's the reality of Another World.

249
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,628
Not exactly. We're right over here.

250
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,881
-<i>Go, Wolf.</i>
-<i>That's it, Mabel!</i>

251
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,216
-What?
-Then who's fighting?

252
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,177
It's illusion magic that uses ice.

253
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,139
When Mabel cast the spell,
I instantly copied it.

254
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,725
Wild Talker is seriously incredible.

255
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,770
<i>Why are you here, by the way?</i>

256
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,440
<i>I was officially appointed</i>
<i>as the kingdom's royal knight.</i>

257
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,734
Wow! That's great.

258
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:05,779
Yeah. The salary and benefits are good.

259
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,157
An adventurer's pay is garbage
compared to mine.

260
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:14,204
Adventuring is a waste of time
if you consider your future.

261
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:18,667
Wolf, become a royal knight with me.
I'm waiting for you to join me.

262
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,835
<i>She's bragging.</i>

263
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,713
<i>She's like a bum who looks down on others</i>
<i>as soon as he finds a job.</i>

264
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,925
<i>Mabel, may I ask how you were appointed?</i>

265
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,384
Why so polite?

266
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,637
<i>I was sleeping on a field</i>
<i>in a beast's robe.</i>

267
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,681
<i>I was almost hunted down</i>
<i>by the royal knights on a patrol.</i>

268
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:36,727
<i>I did them in with my sword instead.</i>
<i>They recognized my skills and hired me.</i>

269
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,397
I don't know if you are ready
for this kind of responsibility, Wolf.

270
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:41,690
Wow!

271
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,568
What should we do about this?

272
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,447
Let me win, and I'll keep you
as my subordinate.

273
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,909
My salary will go up,
and you will be appointed a royal knight.

274
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,328
-If we do this--
-Are you asking me to throw the fight?

275
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:58,040
Well, this is just a formality,
more like a game.

276
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,418
A game? Far from it.
You've got to take it seriously.

277
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,048
I've lost to you twice in the past.

278
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,509
So let's do it.

279
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,886
Why do you want to beat me so badly?

280
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,516
We spent a night in the same bed!

281
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,602
Don't you think I'm cute?
Not even a little bit?

282
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,188
Of course you're cute, Mabel.

283
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,023
What?

284
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,608
I see.

285
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,694
But the illusion!

286
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,612
You thought we wouldn't catch on?

287
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,870
You, the evil orc's henchman,
infiltrated our stronghold.

288
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,163
What? That's not it--

289
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,582
Then explain why a descendant
of the famed ice clan

290
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,378
was sleeping on a field like a vagrant.

291
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,506
<i>She's unemployed.</i>

292
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,800
If you have no answers, then…

293
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,019
-What's going on now?
-They're fighting each other?

294
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,611
Raffald!

295
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,907
-What are you doing?
-Commander, it's too dangerous!

296
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,119
<i>Kulosha l'gid riolran.</i>

297
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,512
What was I doing?

298
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,766
The power to control the body and soul
of a living being--

299
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,267
that's divine magic.

300
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,396
Bishop, you manipulated Mabel's mind.

301
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:50,110
You, who can break my superior magic,
must truly be a dark orc!

302
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,322
What were you going to do
with Mabel under your control?

303
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,491
Isn't it obvious?
You know too much. You must die--

304
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,993
You were going to do
perverted things to her!

305
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,872
Like licking the cheek
of a girl who can't fight back!

306
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,543
-<i>That's old-fashioned perversion.</i>
-<i>What is that?</i>

307
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,295
Hey, stay with us.

308
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,548
This is a healing-spell card.

309
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:16,303
Commander, are you sure you want to
join forces with a pervert like him?

310
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,139
No! I wanted to protect my country
from monsters

311
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,433
-and bring salvation to the land!
-How you willingly

312
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,394
get dragged through dirt for
the sake of your kingdom is commendable.

313
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,563
But there must be another way.

314
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,358
Why don't you

315
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,612
trust the power of the people
who love and respect you?

316
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:40,160
Commander, we mustn't stoop this low.

317
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,079
Yes, let's stop this.

318
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,456
You've become unbearable to watch,
Commander.

319
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,500
Everything's gone wrong
since the hero's ordination.

320
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,419
-This isn't like you, Commander.
-No!

321
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,504
Please don't do this.

322
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,005
My men…

323
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:57,719
I turned into a monster the moment
I used those three heroes as my pawns.

324
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,431
They may have survived,
but it's too late to change what happened.

325
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,145
It's not too late!

326
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,648
Let's turn back, Commander!

327
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,406
Yes, sir.

328
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:19,366
-Hooray!
-Commander!

329
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,536
-The power of education.
-Education is amazing.

330
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,580
What foolishness.

331
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,082
How can we protect our kingdom
without military funds?

332
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,292
I'll help you.

333
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,004
When you are threatened,
face the skies and say my name.

334
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,257
Spirits will carry your message.
My name is--

335
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,341
Hold it.

336
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,470
I am Ricardo Markfeld.

337
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,976
I'm Mansaku Kamegashira.

338
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,603
Wolfgunblood?

339
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,188
I'm Wolfgunblood.

340
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,522
<i>That was too close!</i>

341
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,817
<i>He was about to have people shouting</i>
<i>a ridiculous name to the skies.</i>

342
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:59,990
Commander, you have become soft.
What help will this orc be to us?

343
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,867
<i>Zacktorla katluf.</i>

344
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,288
More protean magic? Enough pretense!

345
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,915
You think I'd fall for--

346
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,380
Blaze dragon.

347
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,802
Commander Markfeld.

348
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,264
Apologize to the three heroes
the next time you see them.

349
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,391
They may forgive you.

350
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,240
Giant dragon protean magic.

351
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,745
Uncle!

352
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:47,955
This part's awesome.

353
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:51,083
It was especially cool when you said,
"Don't you trust your men?"

354
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:55,045
When in a pinch, you need to put
the undead hero in berserk mode,

355
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,506
-or activate parasite bomb.
<i>-It's really just video game talk.</i>

356
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,508
Teamwork is the only way to win.

357
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,594
Well, anyhow, all's well that ends well.

358
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,596
TERMINATION NOTICE -
MABEL RAYVEIL

359
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,557
<i>Mabel.</i>

360
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,728
<i>The spirit of memory can even translate</i>
<i>on-screen texts.</i>

361
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,522
<i>I feel like I'm watching</i>
<i>a foreign cartoon.</i>

362
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,068
What a refreshing breeze.

363
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:20,153
But don't you think the sun is glaring?

364
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,863
Hold it, Takafumi.

365
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,033
Wow!

366
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,910
Wait. Why?

367
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,372
You look affected by magic.

368
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,457
Any idea what it might be?

369
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,251
Magic. Let's see.

370
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,338
<i>The only time I used magic was on campus.</i>

371
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,007
Oh, did you know this?

372
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,218
You can recite magic in abbreviations!

373
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,221
Instantaneous when fighting against
humans, and its power multiplies!

374
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,681
-That's it.
-What?

375
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,642
You've barely met the spirits,
but you showed no respect.

376
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,896
You basically said "ASAP THX BRO."
Of course they're mad.

377
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,858
The spirit of wind blows harder.

378
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,485
The spirit of light shines brighter.

379
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,448
The spirit of figure transforms humans
into dragons.

380
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:07,242
Isn't the spirit of figure being
too harsh?

381
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,952
Don't worry, Fujimiya.

382
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,246
<i>Zacktorla katluf.</i>
