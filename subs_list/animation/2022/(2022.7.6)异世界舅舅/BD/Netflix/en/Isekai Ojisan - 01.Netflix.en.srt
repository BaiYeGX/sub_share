00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:31,966
Sorry about that.

12
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:36,971
I just came back from spending
17 years in Granbahamal.

00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,894

You must be Takafumi, my sister's kid.

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,256
You've grown up.

00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,591
Where is everyone?

21
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,470
After you fell into a coma,

22
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:23,434
the family fought bitterly over
what to do with you until it fell apart.

23
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,605

my mom would rather not see you.

It's true.

46
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:56,027
Anyway, were you about to hit me
with harsh reality just now?

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,488
-Nope.
-You sure?

48
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,906
What did you do just now?

49
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,367
Magic.

That's amazing! How do you do that?

52
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:08,957
Never mind it.

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,626
Who's winning the Console War? Is it SEGA?

54
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,752
What?

55
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,588
<i>SEGA? Nowadays?</i>

56
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,593
In Japan, Sony and Nintendo
dominate the industry.

00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,345
What? What about SEGA?

58
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,139
-Is that something you need to know--
-What about SEGA?

59
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,102
Well… it gave up making consoles
a good while ago.

This spell erases memories.

63
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,410

<i>Is SEGA's decline such a big shock to him?</i>

65
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:51,249
The other world was fraught
with difficulties.

66
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,709
Want to take a look?

67
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,210
Oh, sure.

68
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,349

I shouldn't say this, since I'm crashing,
but isn't this unit too big for just you?

81
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,240
Yeah, I used to share this room
with someone else,

82
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,492
but I had troubles with them.

83
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,494
A roommate? Was it a girlfriend?

84
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,912
Well, no…

85
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,038
Wow…

86
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,459
No, it's called a room share!
Haven't you heard of it?

87
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,502
No.

Wow, you looked that up in seconds.

91
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,803
Electronic dictionaries sure have evolved.

92
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,597
Yep… Wait, what?

93
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,059
Little Takafumi…

94
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,897
is old enough to recruit friends
and live with them.

95
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:10,656
What were your friends like
in the other world?

96
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,912
I basically played solo for 17 years.

97
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,712
Is that right…

98
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,431
Everyone over there is good-looking.

99
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,892
They're all handsome men
and beautiful women.

100
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,852
That's great.

101
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,438
I must have looked ugly…

102
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:54,742
I was hunted down as an orc variant.

103
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,827
Uncle, hold on.

104
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,704
-Then--
-It's too heavy!

105
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,917
I don't want to hear this
while washing the dishes.

106
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:08,089
That's how it usually went,
but some were particularly aggressive.

107
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,674
I told you to wait!

108
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,177
They followed me around every day
and pestered and harassed me.

109
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,181
No matter what I did, they made fun of me
and wouldn't let me be who I am.

110
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,227
How horrible…

111
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,106
So that's the reality
of a parallel world fantasy life.

112
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:29,569
I saved her life when I met her.
She didn't even thank me.

113
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,487
She sounds like the worst.

114
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,738
Right?

115
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:37,577
She said, "No one asked for your help.
Don't touch me!

116
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,539
Don't misinterpret it.
I didn't save you for your sake.

117
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:47,253
I must be the only one who can stand
being with an orc face like you!"

118
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,424
She berated me to no end.

119
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,718
I got rid of her in some city
and took off.

120
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,142
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

121
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:03,894
<i>Don't misinterpret me!</i>

122
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:10,735
<i>I must be the only one who can stand</i>
<i>being with an orc face like you.</i>

123
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,202
<i>The concept of</i> tsundere
<i>became popular around 2004.</i>

124
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,914
<i>Four years after my uncle left</i>
<i>for the other world.</i>

125
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,208
What happened to her afterwards?

126
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,127
What? Who knows?

127
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:35,384
Anyway, my life didn't go well
in the other world, either.

128
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,055
But now I've come back,

129
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,308
there's the Internet, optical fiber,
and even "wii-fii"!

130
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,226
This is great!

131
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,688
With videos, even I can connect
with people from around the world.

132
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,149
What?

133
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,734
EVEN A 5TH GRADER LIKE ME
CAN TELL HOW FAKE THIS IS.

134
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,110

140
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,294

I want this cell phone.

147

It doesn't open up but slides around.

148
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,940
Uncle, that one's a 2G.

149
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,276
Can I buy it through this online auction?

150
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,780
You can't make calls on it
since it uses an outdated radio wave.

151
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,241
That's fine. I don't care about calls.

152
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,327
What about your junior high

That one looks like the cheapest option.

158
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,518
You already researched it.

159
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,646
Those smartphones may be tiny,
but they sure are powerful.

160
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,189
You'll soon get the hang of it.

161

{\an8}"Touch," "swipe," "pinch out"…

162
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:19,864

00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:20,948
Yeah?

164
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:26,787
But the cool ones that open up,
slide, or spin around are all gone.

165
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,915
Technological innovation.
Everyone uses touch panel phones now.

166
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,918
That's 17 years of innovation.

167
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:37,089
Actually, I made a technological
advancement in the other world.

168
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,924
What did you invent?

169
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,721
I created a vase that poured out water
in a drought-stricken village.

170
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,473
Awesome! How did you do that?

171
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,017
I used two spells to…

172
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,312
It'll be easier to show you my memory.

00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,743
These magic-storing cards
are called talismans.

177
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:11,874
I'll forgo the details, but it worked by
reversing the water electrolysis process.

178
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,169
Modern science is undefeated!

179
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,172
Uncle, you dominated the other world.

180
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,091
The people must have sung your praises
and revered you.

181
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:22,593
Not really.

182
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,432
They tried to hang me.

183
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,436
The vase, smashed to smithereens.

184
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,193
It wasn't acceptable in their religion.

185
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,778
<i>Hold it!</i>

186
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,864
Someone came to rescue you.

187
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,200
Yeah, that's the girl
bent on harassing me.

188
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,910
This girl?

189
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:52,164
<i>Yes, he has an evil countenance.</i>
<i>He is more like an orc than a man.</i>

190
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,959
<i>I don't blame you for distrusting him,</i>
<i>however--</i>

191
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,502
<i>War-grent grakka.</i>

192
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,632
<i>That was rough…</i>

193
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,093
That's how it went.

194
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:10,975
Sorry.

195
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,645
It's hard to see
from the first-person view.

196
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,729
That bothers you?

197
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,609
Swipe it like this to turn the camera.

198
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,570
-Here we go.
-How is that possible?

199
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,072
Pinch in to make it smaller.

200
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,700
They almost hunted you down.

201
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,036
Can we see what happened to that girl?

202
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,248
Sure. Let's pinch out to enlarge.

203
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,083
There she is.

204
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,379
<i>That coward…</i>

205
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,506
<i>He ran away.</i>

206
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,429
<i>Goodness…</i>

207
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,682
<i>What a kind girl!</i>
<i>She's also super beautiful!</i>

208
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:54,435
That's right, I'm a coward.

209
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,520
END OF AUCTION NOTIFICATION

210
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,730
Yes, the auction.

211

{\an8}TIME LEFT

{\an8}PLACE A BID

214
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,070
I'm placing a bid!

215
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,572
What's the shipping cost?

216
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,781
What?

217
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,034
AUCTION ENDED -
CONGRATULATIONS! YOU WON!

218
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,118
{\an8}CHECK YOUR TRANSACTION

219
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,412
BID WON - 1,600 YEN,
SHIPMENT FEE - 2,000 YEN

220
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,333
The shipping is 2,000 yen.

221
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,877
It's shipped from a remote island
I've never heard of.

222
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,257
We don't have to pay for shipping
if we pick it up in person.

223
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,897
What?

224
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,359
Uncle!

225
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,156
I'll be back soon.

226
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,247
30 MINUTES LATER

227
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,332
I'm back.

228
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,254
Uncle…

229
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,009
{\an8}How do you like this headphone?

230
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,345
-Where is it auctioned from?
-Kumamoto.

231
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,430
Five minutes tops.

232
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:16,892
How about this couch?

233
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,560
Too heavy to haul around.

234
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,521
I'll give you a shoulder massage
afterward.

235
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,439
Well, okay then.

236
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,986
<i>My uncle learned how to buy online</i>
<i>with free shipping.</i>

237
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,531
{\an8}Thank you.

238
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,827
I could have gone to get it.

239
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,996
This rice was on a special discount
on Amazon.

240
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,205
Can you grab me a knife?

241
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,251
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

242
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,797
What's this? Where'd you get it?

243
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,632
Dimensional storage.

244
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,635
Also, this. It's for slaying dragons,
so handle with caution.

245
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,887
You had that at the hospital.

246
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,974
Do you have anything else
from the other world?

247
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,100
Certainly.

248
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,478
I have this magic sword.

249
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,149
My deposit…

250
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,317
I have precious metals, too.

251
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,405
This crystallization of mermaid's tears
was crafted with magic.

252
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,991
This ring is sculpted from rainbow coral.

253
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,785
This gem alone can pay to build a castle
in the other world.

254
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,078
Let's sell it!

255
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,330
Fifty yen.

256
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,292
I took it to a pawn shop.

257
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,419
It was appraised for 50 yen.

258
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,754
It's a bit too rare.

259
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,550
Our views aren't growing.

260
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,510
We need a breakthrough.

261
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,678
Uncle,

262
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:39,391
did you have this ring because
you meant to gift it to someone?

263
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:42,770
Not really.
Gems are more like memorabilia.

264
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,607
They can only be obtained
after beating challenging dungeons.

265
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,858
Is that so?

266
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,994
You want to talk about relationships?

267
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:03,165
Not really. You don't seem interested in
that kind of thing. So, no thanks.

268
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,502
Cut the nonsense.
I've lived for over 30 years.

269
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,087
That comes with experience.

270
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,092
I met my first love in grade school.

271
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,384
What were they like?

272
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,220
They were Sonic and Tails.

273
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,055
What?

274
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:31,235
{\an8}<i>I stopped by the toy shop's display window</i>
<i>every day and spent hours watching the TV.</i>

275
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:37,116
The title scene was so cute,
I never got tired of it.

276
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,326
Do you have any experience
involving people?

277
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,828
Of course I do.

278
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,790
<i>Kaede Nanase was a good friend of mine.</i>

279
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,960
<i>The enemy group's leader murdered her.</i>

280
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,671
<i>She was then revived as a living machine.</i>

281
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:54,383
They relentlessly attack her to obtain
the salvation weapon Seven Force.

282
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,677
Stage three's boss is the fifth form of…

283
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,305
<i>Does he have any experience</i>
<i>outside of video games in his life?</i>

284
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,225
Did you meet any girls in the other world?

285
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,185
-I did.
-What?

286
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,647
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

287
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,627
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

288
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:05,078
And that's how I saved her from a monster.

289
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,583
<i>More like she offered her life</i>
<i>in exchange for her brothers'.</i>

290
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,460
Wasn't that smooth?

291
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:15,505
Immediately afterward, I was struck
from a blind spot by some goblins.

292
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,759
They threw me off a cliff,
and that was that.

293
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,636
What a disaster.

294
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:27,476
<i>The two brothers snuck behind him</i>
<i>with terrifying looks on their faces.</i>

295
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,853
Let's check how that ambush occurred.

296
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,396
I'm sure they were goblins.

297
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,107
-Yeah?
-Yeah, absolutely!

298
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:39,404
I was on the brink of death
when she stumbled into me.

299
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,282
I hate to say this, but she saved me.

300
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,337
You…

301
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,881
Why did you…

302
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,174
Don't you misunderstand.

303
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,051
You are indebted to me now.

304
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:04,137
Spend the rest of your life bowing to me.

305
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,224
The rest of my life?

306
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,308
What?

307
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,938
That's not what I meant.

308
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,524
I didn't mean "together forever"
or anything.

309
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,112
W-what? Stay away from me!

310
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,031
I'd rather not owe you a huge favor.

311
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,825
-Will this do?
-What?

312
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,995
What?

313
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,832
It's a cosmite ring, said to be
one of the only seven in existence.

314
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,334
What are you doing?

315
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:40,757
How does it fit?

316
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,801
Wait, hold on!

317
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,138
It's too sudden…

318
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,514
Do you not want it?

319
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,355
I do…

320
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,865
<i>My uncle is about to do</i>
<i>something outrageous!</i>

321
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,242
{\an8}Was that okay to do?

322
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:11,830
{\an8}Looks like it means the same in the other
world. Did you take responsibility?

323
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,165
{\an8}Of course I did.

324
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,628
{\an8}I was responsible enough to have it
redeemed at the next town.

325
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,213
Uncle!

326
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:30,390
You said you dodged her in some town.
So it was this one.

327
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,893
No. She kept following me around.

328
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,770
Maybe she got a taste for money.

329
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,190
<i>I deposited it at a bank.</i>
<i>Where are you going next?</i>

330
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,568
<i>What? You'll stay here for now?</i>
<i>What a coincidence. Me, too!</i>

331
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,111
She's resilient.

332
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,198
As you can see,

333
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,701
these kinds of rare items
can be useful on many occasions.

334
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,913
Let's stash that knife in here.

335
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,039
Sure.

336
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,468
{\an8}UNCLE!?

337
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,305
<i>My uncle's new video</i>
