00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,840
<i>August 2018.</i>

2
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:12,470
<i>Record-breaking heat waves</i>
<i>were observed across Japan.</i>

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,558
Weird.

4
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,853
Why isn't it reading my disc?

5
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:24,315
Maybe the heat got to it.

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,276
Or maybe it's just old
and stopped working.

7
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:29,029
What? No! Please say it isn't so!

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,656
-It's okay, Uncle. We can fix this.
-Why isn't it working?

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,743
-I'm sure we can fix it.
-No, no! This can't be happening!

10
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,249
{\an8}UNCLE:
YOU'RE FINE THE WAY YOU ARE

11
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,157
GET HOME

12
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,413
SOLD CHEAPER THAN A SCOURING PAD

13
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,549
I'm surprised.

14
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,968
Messing with the console
in this sweltering heat?

15
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,304
So glad we found the instructions online.

16
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:23,184
<i>Never thought I'd see a 64-bit CPU</i>
<i>in real life.</i>

17
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,021
Still, for my Saturn to just give out
without warning…

18
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,940
Maybe it really is the heat.

19
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,692
Does anyone want ice cream?

20
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,319
-Me!
-I do!

21
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,239
My dad and Chiaki went fishing.

22
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,116
The ice cream is from me.

23
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,245
Hey, what if you used ice magic
to cool off the room?

24
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,247
Wait. What?

25
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,254
-Yes!
-So chill!

26
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,922
She's a genius!

27
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,049
Thank you, Coolermiya!

28
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,343
I'm a what?

29
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,722
How did you not think of this?

30
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,850
I'm sure the heat got to our heads.

31
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,645
Or maybe it was the hour we spent
transformed into dragons

32
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,899
that made it hard to think like people.

33
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,025
That's right.

34
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,111
Dragons don't have to worry
about their future.

35
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,071
Wanna transform again?

36
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,823
Changing form won't solve your problems!

37
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,993
You need to get an AC unit.

38
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:24,829
Trust me, we want to. But we're broke.

39
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,789
Not to mention the spike
in the the power bill.

40
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,208
You need some new YouTube content.

41
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,712
I know. What if you stream
the memories from Another World

42
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,714
we always watch together?

43
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,216
Not a bad idea.

44
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,383
Don't you dare.

45
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,219
Why not?

46
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,805
Uncle, can you project my thoughts?

47
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,392
Hold on. That's <i>icuras yuul elran</i>, so…

48
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,603
Spirit of Memory,

49
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,105
project his thoughts.

50
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:03,451
POOR MINOTAUR, HE HASN'T DONE
A THING - I'M SHAKING WITH RAGE

51
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,119
They'll eat you alive.

52
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,955
Can people be this vicious?

53
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,958
I would. Trolling passes the time.

54
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,043
You sure love the Internet.

55
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,796
So we need another idea that uses magic.

56
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:18,549
Which spirit can I ask for help?

57
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,804
I might be a bit behind.
What are these spirits, anyway?

58
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,473
How do they look?

59
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,143
{\an8}<i>We're talking parallel-world fantasy here.</i>

60
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,188
{\an8}<i>They must take the form</i>
<i>of beautiful girls!</i>

61
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,399
Actually, they don't have human forms.

62
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,566
They don't?

63
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,652
"Spirit" is a loose term.

64
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,446
In reality, they are collections
of concepts and ideas.

65
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,201
I can hear their faint voices
here and there.

66
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,245
But that's…

67
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,372
But you communicate with them, right?

68
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,917
I feel like I do.

69
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,963
I get a vague sense
of what they're trying to convey.

70
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,674
Even now, they are whispering to me.

71
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:05,138
I can hear all sorts of things.

72
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:10,852
Are you sure it's safe to talk to them?

73
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,186
What do you mean?

74
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,564
Doesn't it take a mental toll
to communicate with them?

75
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:19,235
Well, you know, as you can see…

76
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,784
All right. The head of a cow.

77
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,370
Guess I'll go get a cow's head.

78
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,455
What?

79
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,332
{\an8}BUY A WHOLE WAGYU BEEF-GRADE COW

80
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,127
{\an8}You can get a wagyu beef-grade cow
for five million yen online.

81
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,253
{\an8}You can?

82
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,088
Five million yen, huh?

83
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,799
But why do you suddenly want a cow's head?

84
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:46,596
The Spirit of Ice demands a price
for its cooler magic.

85
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,473
You need to pay a price?

86
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:50,016
Duh.

87
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,643
It did us a huge favor
it's not used to doing.

88
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,063
We need to properly thank it with a gift.

89
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,190
What will you do with the cow?

90
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,193
The spirit demands us to build an altar
and offer its head.

91
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,528
<i>This just got super sketchy.</i>

92
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:04,322
<i>What entity are we negotiating with?</i>

93
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:09,535
If we don't, the fields on this planet
will be frozen for ten years.

94
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,288
Ten…

95
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:14,082
Isn't that too big a price?

96
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,584
Our cooler fees will cost all of humanity!

97
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,169
Guess we'll go extinct.

98
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:19,462
God, we messed up.

99
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,134
Anyhow, let's grill the fish
and eat it for lunch.

100
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,888
This might be our last feast for the year.

101
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,434
What?

102
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,478
Oh, really?

103
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,188
I understand. Yes.

104
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,689
Excuse me, then.

105
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,696
The spirit also accepts fish heads.

106
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,783
Do the spirits give a damn
about what happens to humanity?

107
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:53,579
A fish and a cow aren't that different
from the spirits.

108
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:57,834
<i>They consider humankind</i>
<i>as just another living organism.</i>

109
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,962
<i>Doesn't bother them one bit</i>
<i>if we all go extinct, I think.</i>

110
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,005
You think?

111
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,799
How do you stay so calm?

112
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:08,136
Yeah, we were on the brink of extinction!

113
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,097
I'm used to it, I guess.

114
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,392
<i>Many shooting games from the '90s</i>

115
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:18,563
<i>start off with the extinction of humans.</i>

116
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:22,150
There you go, playing games
with hellish background stories.

117
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,028
What grudge were game developers
holding against humanity in the '90s?

118
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,701
Uncle!

119
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:35,163
I'm having flashbacks
to when I turned into a dragon.

120
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,875
Raw fish and meat look so delectable.

121
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,376
-I get that.
-Stop it.

122
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,630
<i>You didn't have to turn yourself</i>
<i>into a dragon.</i>

123
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:49,093
I thought Takafumi might feel lonely
being the only dragon around.

124
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:54,599
<i>I thought you'd stay dragons forever.</i>
<i>I was really scared.</i>

125
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:59,353
It was comforting to have a companion.
Do you want to try being a dragon with us?

126
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,315
-The more, the merrier.
-No way!

127
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,692
Remember, we need to be careful.

128
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,403
Stay transformed too long,

129
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,073
and we won't be able to turn back
to our human forms.

130
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,035
Let me show you. <i>Icuras elran</i>.

131
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:19,707
<i>I stayed in my dragon form for a month</i>
<i>after leaving the capital.</i>

132
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:21,417
-Huh?
-Why?

133
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:26,422
<i>The blaze dragon's instincts took over.</i>
<i>I couldn't turn myself back.</i>

134
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,217
<i>I could've stayed a dragon forever.</i>

135
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,010
That's really bad!

136
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,096
Why did you take such a huge risk
and transform?

137
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,806
<i>Well…</i>

138
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,896
<i>I thought it'd be cooler than walking off.</i>

139
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,273
You did look cool, but…

140
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,108
What a stupid reason.

141
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,195
How were you able to turn back?

142
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,531
Let's see…

143
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,787
I finally found you.

144
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,263
The capital is in turmoil after seeing
an orc transform into a dragon.

145
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,641
The town is in a frenzy.

146
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,563
You've made a big mess.

147
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,026
I can't believe you.

148
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,445
<i>It's Ms. Tsundere!</i>

149
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,906
TRANSFIGURE MY PHYSICAL SHAPE,
SILHOUETTE

150
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,953
Magical flame, eh?

151
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,621
Flame resistance spell card!

152
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,750
How weak.

153
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,921
You're no match for a real one!

154
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:09,025
It's the first time a battle in this
fantasy world actually felt fantastic.

155
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,361
-Yeah.
-I've shown you lots of fights, though.

156
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,697
<i>Usually you either get owned</i>

157
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,907
<i>or win in seconds.</i>

158
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,085
Don't you roar at me!

159
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,055
Dummy. You are…

160
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,437
enough to deal with as an orc.

161
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,419
Look what we have here.

162
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,132
The shape-shifting orc,
just like the rumors say.

163
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,427
I hired these mercenaries to hunt it down,

164
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,430
but it seems like our little guest
beat us to it.

165
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,932
You're from the Regfalgen Company.

166
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,102
I appreciate your business.

167
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,398
Now, hand over the orc alive,
and we'll reward you handsomely.

168
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:35,820
Though it's only a drop
compared to your debt.

169
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,533
May I know when you'll pay us back?

170
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,535
I gave you my word.

171
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,621
We already agreed on a due date.
Are you trying to rush me?

172
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:49,041
The head of the company
ought to show more generosity.

173
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,754
What mighty words, coming from
the daughter of the royal Elga family.

174
00:11:55,548 --> 00:12:00,511
Thank you for your example
of how leaders act.

175
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,598
Take note of her generous words.

176
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:09,353
Okay. "I am the debt-trodden princess.
Heed my words!"

177
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,231
-What?
-Elf is a princess?

178
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,649
Yep.

179
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:16,986
Do you hear that? She's royalty!
A princess!

180
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,113
That's nothing special.

181
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,490
Valgar is a prince too.

182
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,326
Serena may be the last of her people,
but she also hails from royalty.

183
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,370
-That's in a video game!
-Only in the game!

184
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,622
-<i>And?</i>
-<i>"And"?</i>

185
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,125
I see you did some digging.

186
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:34,336
You are our biggest client,
Your Royal Highness.

187
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,088
Do not address me as that.

188
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,717
You ought to be more affable.

189
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,428
Your Royal Highness.

190
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,523
Princess Elf, you mustn't be upset.

191
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,650
The contract spell card of darkness.

192
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,195
We exchanged an oath
under the spirit's name.

193
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,114
You cannot use violence against us.

194
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,534
Pay your debt off and gain your freedom,
or become my betrothed.

195
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,244
Those are your only options.

196
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:12,041
You should've thought twice
before you offered yourself as collateral.

197
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:17,171
A betrothal to an elf royal
will surely lead to our prosperity.

198
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:21,759
My name, Hagen Regfalgen,
shall be known far and wide--

199
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,761
<i>Kulosha l'gid riolran.</i>

200
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:32,019
You're the one who helped
turn me back into a human.

201
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,522
Yeah. It's been a while--

202
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,734
I don't know what's going on,
but we're even now.

203
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,194
What?

204
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,404
See you.

205
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,658
Don't go! Stop!

206
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,160
Why are you like this?

207
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,913
Don't touch me. It's been forever since…

208
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:54,250
-It's been a month!
-I haven't washed up in a month.

209
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,043
You don't stink.

210
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,337
You haven't truly smelled it yet.

211
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,339
I got a good whiff when you were asleep.

212
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,801
Why did you do that?

213
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,511
Don't get me wrong.

214
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,805
I didn't want to smell you.
When I hugged you--

215
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,057
I meant,

216
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,269
I tried to strangle you and got a whiff.

217
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,230
-<i>Terrible.</i>
-<i>Another sorry excuse.</i>

218
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,941
Right. That makes sense.

219
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,443
I was almost done for.

220
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,154
<i>He really thinks she wanted to kill him.</i>

221
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,408
<i>He just doesn't understand tsunderes.</i>

222
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:33,122
You forcibly broke our contract
bound by a spell card?

223
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,457
You've foiled my plans!

224
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,084
You orc filth!

225
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,587
-You owed him money?
-What is your involvement?

226
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,591
-Does it look like we're involved?
-Cut out this farce!

227
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,177
Boss.

228
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,889
Since the contract is in shambles now,

229
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:54,101
can I teach her a lesson?

230
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,604
It's Doldor, the gigant hunter!

231
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:01,567
I came for the dragon's head,
but I get this nonsense instead.

232
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,529
I need to blow off some steam somehow!

233
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,780
That's right!

234
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,868
-Teach that pesky elf a lesson!
-You brought this on yourself.

235
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:15,456
A little pain will teach you your place.

236
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,958
I'm not as kind as the orc.

237
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,169
You are one against many.

238
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,630
I'll end this in a heartbeat.

239
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:33,515
This is a cosmite ring,
said to be one of only seven in existence.

240
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,143
It's invaluable.

241
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,604
No, thanks.

242
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,565
I'm sorry.
I had no idea she owed you money.

243
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,525
-This sets everything straight.
-No…

244
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,778
Please accept this token of my feelings.

245
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,363
What?

246
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,956
I spent all my money buying that back.

247
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,464
<i>Scary.</i>

248
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,886
The ground is collapsing!

249
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,806
Watch out!

250
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,646
-It's a swamp!
-It's muddy!

251
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,401
What do we do now, boss?

252
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,738
Leave them. I've no use for an elf
covered in filthy swamp water.

253
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,200
Damn it!

254
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,661
It's stuck!

255
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:40,165
-Congratulations.
-Congrats!

256
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,168
This is nothing to celebrate,
you buffoons!

257
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,962
We're leaving right now!

258
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,132
The ring was too small.

259
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,011
What are you thinking, going into debt?

260
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,721
I had no other choice.

261
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,932
I had to buy this back somehow.

262
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,269
Wait. That's the ring I gave you.

263
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,896
-But I pawned it for you.
-But…

264
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,691
What a waste.

265
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,485
You don't need jewelry.

266
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,320
Don't lecture me, stupid orc.

267
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,073
You are beautiful without accessories.

268
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,245
What?

269
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,457
You're covered in mud.

270
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,001
Dirty orc! Muddy orc!

271
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,919
You're filthy too.

272
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,967
You're right.

273
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:38,307
Who cares whether we're orcs
or elves at this point.

274
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,105
I've had enough mud for the day.

275
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,399
I need a bath tonight.

276
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,694
This area is volcanic.
There are hot springs around.

277
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,946
Seriously? Where?

278
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,531
Over there.

279
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:59,661
You know, you care about hygiene
more than you let on.

280
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,456
We all need to wash up
at least once a day.

281
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,044
Seasoned adventurers only bathe
once a month with no problem.

282
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,046
-What?
-That's what I--

283
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,968
What's that for?

284
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,679
<i>And that's how…</i>

285
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,933
I got beat up for no reason.

286
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,559
<i>It was your fault.</i>

287
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,645
<i>You're the reason.</i>

288
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,649
I hate to say this, but Elf helped me
turn back into a human.

289
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,029
I didn't know there were hot springs
in Another World.

290
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,989
Yeah. I bathed right after that.

291
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,741
That's nice.

292
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,661
It's freezing. A hot bath would be nice.

293
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,500
It's ten degrees Celsius in mid-August!

294
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,878
It's freezing!
Uncle, stop the cooler magic!

295
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,963
Okay.

296
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,305
Wanna open the window?

297
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,099
No, thanks.

298
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,562
If we accidentally upset
the Spirit of Ice…

299
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,480
We'll lead humanity to extinction!

300
00:19:10,023 --> 00:19:12,985
What kind of species goes extinct
because of an opened window?

301
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,445
Let's buy a proper AC.

302
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,739
I'll help you cover the cost.

303
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,409
It goes against my dignity as a YouTuber.

304
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,162
Shut up, self-proclaimed ad affiliate!

305
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,915
Maybe you can slay the cooled air
with your Shadow Sword.

306
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:30,377
That sword isn't used like that.

307
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,213
Enough magic. Let's buy an AC.

308
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,215
Let me see your phone, Takafumi.

309
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,633
Okay.

310
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,136
Spirit of Darkness,

311
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,723
manifest thyself in the form of a blade.

312
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,476
See?

313
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,520
{\an8}No service.

314
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,274
{\an8}-You shut off cell service and Wi-Fi!
-Wow.

315
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:57,529
My Shadow Sword interrupts energy streams
such as magic and phone signals.

316
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,741
I believe it also cuts off
IR communication.

317
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,869
Where's your IR port?

318
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,788
What? IR communication?

319
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,167
It's Bluetooth!

320
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,837
Then where's the Bluetooth port?

321
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,672
It doesn't need ports.

322
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,926
I know. It's got something to do
with Blu-ray, doesn't it?

323
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,761
Wrong.

324
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:26,642
<i>It was kind of fun to chat away</i>
<i>under the blankets as we froze</i>

325
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,645
<i>in the sweltering heat</i>
<i>of the August weather.</i>

326
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,148
<i>We'll eat fish every day this summer.</i>

327
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,616
This is gruesome.

328
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,077
It's a parasitic species.

329
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,705
Did he catch it from the river fish?

330
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,415
Poor thing.

331
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,792
His stomach doesn't look like a human's.

332
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,169
He said it's a parasite.

333
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,762
-Orc-face, you can't barge into our room.
-This is an emergency.

334
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,647
-Good. You're all clear.
-Hey, I haven't--

335
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,359
There's a parasitic species
going around town.

336
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,946
If you're infected,
symptoms should be visible on the belly.

337
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,075
That's what you are checking for.

338
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,244
Huh? What?

339
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,455
Dummy, let me go!

340
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,922
-Mabel?
-I haven't done a thing!

341
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,174
And you! How dare you…

342
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:14,935
-Something's inside my guts!
-<i>Turn this off!</i>

343
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,146
Uncle, please turn this off.

344
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,820
We planned on eating fish for lunch.

345
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,322
No way. Not touching it.

346
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,950
Then what do you want to eat?

347
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,159
Well…

348
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:40,919
