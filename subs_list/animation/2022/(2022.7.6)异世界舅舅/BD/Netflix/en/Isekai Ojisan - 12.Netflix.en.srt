1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,171
-A recorded warning?
-Right.

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:09,884
If SEGA SATURN discs are accidentally
inserted into a CD player,

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,721
they may very well break the radio's
speaker system.

4
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:16,808
Some games contain a voice recording
that warns people.

5
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,728
Finding those discs
is like looking for treasure.

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,105
Anyways, where's your radio CD player?

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,107
We don't own a CD player.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,608
Neither does my family.

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,735
What?

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:30,989
Don't tell me that kids these days
have never heard the recorded warning?

11
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,451
Was the recorded warning
a cultural phenomenon?

12
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:36,953
Weren't there other things to listen to?

13
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:21,247
{\an8}UNCLE:
YOU'RE FINE THE WAY YOU ARE

14
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,155
GET HOME

15
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:00,411
SOLD CHEAPER THAN A SCOURING PAD

16
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,422
<i>Warning: This disc is for use</i>
<i>with the SEGA SATURN system only.</i>

17
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:15,552
It plays on SATURN.
You don't need a CD player!

18
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,513
Too bad the Internet wasn't around
back in your day.

19
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,474
Is it that risky to insert
a SEGA game into a CD player?

20
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,892
It is.

21
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,729
Try to fast-forward the disc,
and it goes, "Whir!"

22
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,356
It makes a terrifying screech.

23
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,440
You've done it before.

24
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,819
This reminds me,
did I tell you about the song beast?

25
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:33,987
Wait, what's that?

26
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,738
There's a singing beast?

27
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,576
Technically, well… Here, let me show you.

28
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,286
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

29
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,415
This was about a month
after the hot spring incident.

30
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,668
I accepted a mission to hunt a song beast.

31
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,336
-I went into the woods.
-<i>Dordo</i>

32
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,713
-It's huge!
-<i>Of wisdom</i>

33
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:52,797
What is this?

34
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,759
<i>Shareg of prowess</i>

35
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,764
<i>Jato of the divine</i>

36
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,852
<i>Venture into the shrine</i>

37
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,313
-It's actually singing.
-<i>Three</i>

38
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,732
-Is this song about Granbahamal?
-<i>Shrines</i>

39
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:15,445
<i>Overcome their trials</i>

40
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,073
-<i>And God will show you the way</i>
-<i>Regsuuid zaldohna.</i>

41
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:23,328
-<i>Wandering warrior</i>
-<i>Kilighd l'gid riolran.</i>

42
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,550
Ice?

43
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:42,555
Wolfgunblood?

44
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,643
The song beast was you, Mabel.

45
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,978
You were singing just now.

46
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,939
Were you listening?

47
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,649
Give me a break.

48
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,443
What are you doing so deep in these woods?

49
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,570
The beasts here will eat you alive.

50
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,572
I won't get eaten.

51
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,618
This beast robe is enchanted
with an illusion spell.

52
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,536
See?

53
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,458
-Wow. Cute. Can I keep it?
-Don't pet me!

54
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,002
With this robe,

55
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,506
I can camp out anywhere
and never worry about getting eaten!

56
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,549
Camp out?

57
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,970
I thought you were appointed
a knight at the capital.

58
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,809
Think outside of the box.

59
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,229
Mabel, don't tell me.

60
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,564
Did you really quit?
It had such good benefits!

61
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,276
Call it my propensity.

62
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,029
The capital's skies
were not vast enough for me.

63
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,532
You get me?

64
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,575
You're free-spirited!

65
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,660
<i>What a show-off.</i>

66
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,329
<i>Why does Mabel always try to outdo others?</i>

67
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,999
And that's how I ended up

68
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,960
setting up my self-sufficient life
out here in the woods.

69
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,297
The menacing ice structure
keeps people at bay.

70
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,717
I'll spend the rest of my life out here.

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,845
Fine. Then I have to slay you.

72
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,139
What?

73
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:10,643
Back in Jato, I accepted a mission
to slay the song beast.

74
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,398
If you, the song beast, wish to stay here,
then that leaves me no choice.

75
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,859
Fine, I'll leave!

76
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,402
What?

77
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,530
Okay then.

78
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,865
All right, fine.

79
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,035
<i>He seemed disappointed.</i>

80
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,329
<i>He still wants to slay Mabel!</i>

81
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,752
I have to get on the move again.

82
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,046
Where do I go starting tomorrow?

83
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,548
You've got plenty of options.

84
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:42,633
Sell the ring I gave you.

85
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,719
Oh, you already did.

86
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,060
You still have it.

87
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,649
Let's pawn it off in town tomorrow.

88
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,153
This one is to keep. I'm not selling it.

89
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:05,823
You're the type of gamer who holds on
to your bomb until it explodes.

90
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,533
I get that though.

91
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,413
What if you become a troubadour?

92
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,248
You're a great singer.

93
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,667
I'm really not.

94
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:21,047
From what I can tell, you must've
practiced a lot to have a voice like that.

95
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:26,385
That's because I've always sung by myself.

96
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,055
Performing for a crowd is a bit…

97
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,975
Yeah, it's nice to keep yourself company.

98
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,060
I understand.

99
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,191
But it's too bad.

100
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,861
A pretty girl with a beautiful voice
can really…

101
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,948
There you go again.

102
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,991
You always do this to me, Wolf.

103
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,370
You would've been filthy rich
had you been born in Japan.

104
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,958
Filthy rich?

105
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,460
Japan Bahamal, my ass!

106
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,462
-Rest of my life?
-Swimming in cash.

107
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,799
Damn, what a dream!

108
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,301
Take me to your world!

109
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,137
I wish.

110
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,514
How can I return home?

111
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,608
If…

112
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,612
And only if you want me to,

113
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:30,867
I can sing songs from your homeland.

114
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,369
Are you sure?

115
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,122
It makes you feel uncomfortable
to sing in front of others.

116
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,541
But…

117
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,752
You looked like you really miss your home.

118
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:46,174
This is the least I can do.

119
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,678
I appreciate that. You're very kind.

120
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,931
I'm not a good singer,
but I'll do my best. Teach me a song.

121
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,686
And then we practiced. I'm skipping ahead.

122
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,646
Uncle…

123
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,315
What kind of songs do you like?

124
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,567
Just the ones you two would know.

125
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,403
This one is written by a famous composer.

126
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,863
-Really?
-Who?

127
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:10,823
Let's see, here it is.

128
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,153
NEW CLAW MACHINE

129
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,489
Shopping mall?

130
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,823
An excursion?

131
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:56,744
You've heard this song before.
You heard it when you were little.

132
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,455
-The latest claw machine!
-The retro claw machine!

133
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:05,253
It's a rendition
of a <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> BGM.

134
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,421
I knew it, it's SEGA-related!

135
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,715
The composer is the one and only--

136
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,300
Forget it.

137
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,094
We wouldn't know anyway.

138
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,387
Yeah?

139
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,976
How was it, Wolf?

140
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,561
Hey.

141
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,281
Will you return to your world someday?

142
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,201
I want to see your homeland.

143
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,245
What a wondrous world.

144
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,421
What's this song from, Uncle?

145
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,340
It's the ending song
for <i>Nights into Dreams</i>.

146
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,384
This one should've been your first pick.

147
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,138
<i>If we follow Mabel Rayveil,</i>

148
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,515
<i>she will lead us</i>
<i>to the dragon-transforming orc.</i>

149
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,643
-<i>Just as Commander Markfeld foresaw.</i>
-These guys!

150
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,188
The royal knights!

151
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,274
Have they been chasing Uncle?

152
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,818
They're asleep. This is our chance.

153
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,655
Who's there? Don't move!

154
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,261
So it was Elf who saved us.

155
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,100
I guess she has some redeeming qualities.

156
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,894
<i>It's a complete bloodbath!</i>

157
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,687
<i>It's not a laughing matter.</i>

158
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,358
<i>-She's staring right at him!</i>
<i>-I'm scared!</i>

159
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,151
And that's how it went.

160
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:56,155
Do you like video game music?

161
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,281
I do.

162
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,991
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

163
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,746
This song is from <i>Dynamite Headdy</i>.
It's my all-time favorite.

164
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,791
Let's give it a listen.

165
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,006
What's wrong, Uncle?

166
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,091
FINGY

167
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,551
I've always thought the heroine's name

168
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,179
was Fingy with a strong "y" sound.

169
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:23,849
But it's actually Fingy, with a soft "y"!

170
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,267
Really.

171
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,435
I had no idea.

172
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,145
DYNAMITE HEADDY

173
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,441
Uncle?

174
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,581
Expi-uncle-docious! Unclebunga!

175
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,501
Hello everyone!
I'm Uncle from Another World's--

176
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,171
Uncle… from Another World.

177
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,715
What gives me the right?

178
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,720
I, who for decades, never realized
"Fingy" was said with a soft "y"!

179
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,098
Uncle from a nutter world, that's me.

180
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,851
Stop the camera!
Let's be done for the day!

181
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:09,895
Madam Barbar's human form
is the boss of the fifth stage.

182
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,313
Her name is Kyoko Onigoroshi.

183
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,066
-She's a hardened mother with…
-Nothing wrong with misunderstanding

184
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,777
-the pronunciation of a made-up name.
-I agree.

185
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,988
Names are important,

186
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,489
that's what she said.

187
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,824
Who said that?

188
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,033
Elf did.

189
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:27,997
She said that when she told me her real
name the day after the singing incident.

190
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,123
-Really.
-Oh, yeah?

191
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,542
Next game…

192
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,003
-Show us.
-I'm still reading my manuals!

193
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,504
Let's watch it, Uncle.

194
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,471
You're having a blast, orc face.

195
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,683
It's you. I thought I lost you.

196
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,728
You and she are a duo from now on?

197
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,438
In this forest? Forever?

198
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,774
Or is it another steamy bath time
with Ms. Hero?

199
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:56,859
What are you saying?

200
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,319
Mabel and Alicia are just--

201
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,321
There you go again.

202
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:03,199
Mabel, Alicia.

203
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,119
You love saying their names, don't you?

204
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,830
I've known you the longest.

205
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,040
-You don't ever say my name.
<i>-This is bad.</i>

206
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,293
But you haven't even told me your name.

207
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,587
Or will Elga do?

208
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,881
-That's a surname, idiot!
-Idiot?

209
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:24,512
You have no right to talk,
with all your name-calling.

210
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,264
It's because you don't reveal
your real name to anyone!

211
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:28,641
I'm Yousuke Shibazaki.

212
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,017
Huh? Shiba--

213
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,649
You're Shibazaki of the Yousuke clan?

214
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,109
Yousuke of the Shibazaki clan.

215
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,031
How do you write it?

216
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,115
Write it?

217
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,498
YOUSUKE SHIBAZAKI

218
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,084
"Shibazaki" means "the cape of an island."

219
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:59,255
"Yousuke" means
"delighted to help others."

220
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,465
You… su…

221
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,802
This is "yo," "u,"

222
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,720
"su"…

223
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,806
Yousuke.

224
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,651
Why'd you tell me out of the blue?

225
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,946
I didn't know
you cared to know my real name.

226
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,365
Of course I do! Names are important.

227
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,576
I suppose you're right.

228
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:29,660
What's your name?

229
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,162
You know mine now.

230
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,167
I'm…

231
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,673
Suzailgiererzegalnelv-
zegilreagranzelga Elga.

232
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,924
What?

233
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:51,473
I said, Suzailgiererzegalnelv-
zegilreagranzelga Elga.

234
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,394
Suza… i…

235
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,647
It's too long to remember.

236
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,067
That's why I said to call me Elf.

237
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,404
What if I call you "Sui" as a nickname?

238
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:06,822
It's the name of royalty.

239
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,491
How can you be so disrespectful?

240
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,744
So you don't like this one.

241
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,370
Then I'll keep calling you Elf.

242
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,915
This isn't about how I feel.

243
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,669
My clan, no, my kingdom won't allow it.

244
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,131
I'm asking you what you think.

245
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,637
"Sui" means "green"
in Japan Bahamal's language.

246
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,721
HISUI

247
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,599
The same character is used
for a green gem called jade.

248
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,893
"Sui"?

249
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,977
Yes.

250
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:42,066
I came up with this nickname
from your eyes that shine like gems.

251
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,862
I don't… Gems? That's too…

252
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,573
-If you don't like it, I'll call you Elf--
-Yousuke.

253
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,241
What, Sui?

254
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,578
Don't call me that!

255
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,246
All right, then I won't.

256
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,540
Stupid Yousuke.

257
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,543
Don't use my nickname
in front of other people.

258
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,921
I'll keep your name a secret too.

259
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,673
Why mine?

260
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,884
I want it just for myse--

261
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,761
Explain, Sui.

262
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,472
Just because!

263
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,477
YOUSUKE - HISUI

264
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,230
And that's how it went.

265
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,023
Uncle!

266
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,192
That was great!

267
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,947
Wolf, have you found anything to eat?

268
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,824
Elf!

269
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,576
Long time no see, Mabel.

270
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,745
Your ring.

271
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,167
What? What?

272
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,753
So, what were you two doing?

273
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,300
I was on a walk.
I was drawn to those old ruins.

274
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,680
This is Jato's shrine.

275
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,433
It was mentioned in your song.

276
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,101
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

277
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,313
My voice! What's that spell?

278
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,650
This dilapidated thing
is one of the three?

279
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,446
It's been left to crumble!

280
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,614
Even if it's destroyed,

281
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,035
it wouldn't bother anyone
except the wandering warrior.

282
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,912
-The wandering …
-Warrior?

283
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,459
Orc face may be worthy
to challenge its trial.

284
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,502
<i>Baraibhut folg bastohl.</i>

285
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,779
Raging divine magic.

286
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,115
I'm not holding any punches back!

287
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,117
<i>Kilighd l'gid riolran.</i>

288
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,078
<i>Kulosha l'gid riolran.</i>

289
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,039
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

290
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,750
-Pause it, Uncle!
-What?

291
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,960
Destroying the ruin will bring a calamity!

292
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,670
That's why I razed it.

293
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,755
-You meant that to happen?
-You meant that to happen?

294
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,383
Some immensurable power
brought me to another world.

295
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,428
I figured if I upended
the power residing in the ruin,

296
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,973
then, you know, it'd get me somewhere.

297
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:24,561
Is your only option to fight
whatever that's in front of you?

298
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,563
You improvise a little too much.

299
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:30,025
But that's only one shrine out of the way.

300
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,528
Aren't there three of them?

301
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,406
Spirit of memory is doing this by itself.

302
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,117
This place!

303
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,869
This is when you and Alicia
defeated the goblin horde.

304
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,954
DORDO

305
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,705
{\an8}SHAREG

306
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,625
You've already done it!

307
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,753
Uncle, it was you who destroyed
the other two ruins!

308
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,171
I did?

309
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,258
Wish a headline popped up
when a mission is accomplished.

310
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,342
SHRINE BREAK BONUS
100000

311
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,885
<i>He lives inside video games.</i>

312
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,095
<i>He's bonkers.</i>

313
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,930
Let's watch the next part.

314
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,231
Unscathed!

315
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,315
No.

316
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:12,985
The grass…

317
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,320
This abnormal surge in life force.

318
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,365
The divine magic has gathered
and gained a form!

319
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,784
It has no physical form.
Attacks are useless!

320
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,662
But divine magic mainly heals.

321
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,585
The corpses of beasts in the area
are rising!

322
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,336
They're going berserk!

323
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,674
Heavy projectile mode.

324
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,723
Drown in the icy blade and sleep.

325
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,730
Damn it.

326
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,276
It's no use!

327
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,237
I'll close in on it and set it ablaze!

328
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,907
<i>Baraibhut folg…</i>

329
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,875
Wolf.

330
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,044
<i>…bastohl.</i>

331
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,024
Not bad, Mabel Rayveil.

332
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,194
Can't believe you saved me.

333
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,447
The god-freezing sword
isn't any ordinary weapon.

334
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,950
But why did Wolf…

335
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:47,746
Some mind-altering spells
can be used to manipulate the target.

336
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,123
-So he's under a spell.
-Crap.

337
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,878
Ashura Steel Fist!

338
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,925
One orc down!

339
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,301
Are you hurt?

340
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:07,057
We came to slay the song beast.
Leave the rest to us.

341
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,850
-Alicia!
-Huh?

342
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,143
Who are they?

343
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,856
<i>Perfect timing!</i>

344
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,733
<i>The three join the fight!</i>

345
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,318
That's the Elf lady.

346
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,113
So that orc must be…

347
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,156
What? Kuroki!

348
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,325
I'm sorry! Let me tend to your wounds!

349
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,787
Hold on, orc face is under a spell.
It's not safe.

350
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,955
What?

351
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,748
We're not fighting the song beast.

352
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,751
We're against the conglomeration
of freed divine magic!

353
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,548
Physical manipulation!

354
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,925
My wand shall bring him back!

355
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,386
Don't. Divine magic is too powerful!

356
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,098
Let the hearts of those
who wander in darkness

357
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,683
become one with mine.

358
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,538
Kuroki.

359
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,375
{\an8}Alicia, hang in there!

360
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,044
{\an8}I told you!

361
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:22,674
{\an8}I caught a glimpse of his past…
his darkness.

362
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,342
{\an8}His darkness?

363
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,637
{\an8}As a little boy,

364
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:32,476
{\an8}Kuroki would stare at a cold, black box
for hours in a tiny room.

365
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,519
{\an8}I didn't know orc face
had such a dark past.

366
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,354
{\an8}-Sickening.
-I pity him.

367
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,898
{\an8}Why didn't we ever guess?

368
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,608
{\an8}-His darkness is too deep…
-Please don't…

369
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,694
{\an8}-for me to reach.
-make my past sound really tragic.

370
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,904
-What?
-What?

371
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,823
{\an8}You don't even try to understand…

372
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,827
{\an8}what you've never understood.

373
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,205
{\an8}Don't

374
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,791
{\an8}force your way of life

375
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,876
{\an8}on me.

376
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,587
{\an8}Don't make us

377
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,756
{\an8}-play against the soccer club…
-He's still able to form sentences.

378
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,216
{\an8}-…as part of the curriculum.
-Although he's under manipulation.

379
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,300
-Horrific.
-Horrific.

380
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,594
<i>Regsuuld stagga.</i>

381
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,764
<i>Stagga magna.</i>

382
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,438
<i>War-grent gragga.</i>

383
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:24,486
I know that bottle.

384
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,753
The blaze…

385
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,213
Dragon?

386
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,091
{\an8}Orc face, you can't possibly…

387
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,259
{\an8}Yes.

388
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:51,179
{\an8}I'm tired of fighting a formless being.

389
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,764
{\an8}The blaze dragon.

390
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:58,562
{\an8}The dragon will absorb
this being's divine healing magic.

391
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,813
{\an8}Then we strike!
