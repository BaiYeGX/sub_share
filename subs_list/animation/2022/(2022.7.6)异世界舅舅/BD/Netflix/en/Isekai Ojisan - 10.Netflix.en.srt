1
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,759
<i>So this is the sketchy guy's apartment.</i>

2
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:12,262
<i>I have to keep Fujimii safe!</i>

3
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:16,349
Let's see. Takaoka…

4
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:19,811
-Damn. He doesn't have a nameplate.
-Hello, there.

5
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,900
Did you also come to hang out?

6
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,902
No. No.

7
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,988
What are you guys up to?

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,448
Help!

9
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,450
Takafumi! Big Bro!

10
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,952
Thanks for coming over.

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,288
Okay.

12
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,710
Let's go up to your room.

13
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,756
I brought home a crazy-good female
the other day.

14
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,341
I take videos of her
and upload them online.

15
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,427
-Oh, a cute little female.
-Yeah.

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,429
I bet the females
don't excite you anymore.

17
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,183
Yeah. It's about time
I start going after the males.

18
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,271
<i>Fujimii!</i>

19
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,191
{\an8}UNCLE:
YOU'RE FINE THE WAY YOU ARE

20
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,099
GET HOME

21
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,355
SOLD CHEAPER THAN A SCOURING PAD

22
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,406
Thanks for the invite!

23
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:38,700
Welcome in.

24
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,077
Why is Sawa here?

25
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:45,123
Run! I'll take care of this.
You have to leave!

26
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,584
-What do you mean?
-These guys are lowlifes.

27
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,336
They call us girls "females"!

28
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,047
I've only seen men like that
in manga for mature women!

29
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,049
You read some hard-core stuff.

30
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,926
Is Uncle gone?

31
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,261
He's out for a bit.

32
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,142
Fish heads?

33
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,854
Those are our Obon offerings.

34
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,815
Not eggplants or cucumbers?

35
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,611
Uncle won't come flying back, will he?

36
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,571
Don't worry. I put up a flag.

37
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,907
The spirits will let him know.

38
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,576
<i>Flag? Spirits?</i>

39
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,996
It's <i>icuras cuora</i>
if she learns his secret.

40
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,122
I know that.

41
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:29,709
Worst-case scenario, he'll obliterate
her personality along with her memories!

42
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,714
-Let's get out of here, Fujimii.
-What?

43
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,801
-Sawa!
-This is one shady cult!

44
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,553
Hold on!

45
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,141
Oh, Uncle!

46
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,495
I'm sorry to be harsh to a follower,

47
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,914
but keep Fujimiya out of it!

48
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,083
A follower?

49
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:14,295
You're hyping us up.
Did you find us on the Internet?

50
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:17,465
None of what we do is real.
We are a wholesome bunch.

51
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:20,969
SEGA isn't like that. Give me a break!

52
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:26,516
<i>He talks just like Aunt Misako,</i>
<i>who was into MLMs.</i>

53
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,228
-A YouTuber?
-I can't find your videos!

54
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:33,856
-I thought he was a cult leader.
-Where did you get that idea?

55
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,360
Takafumi's uncle is odd, but he's nice.

56
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,696
But why are you with them, Fujimii?

57
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:41,406
Well, you know…

58
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,824
"Expi-uncle-docious"!

59
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,325
"Unclebunga"!

60
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,537
This will go viral!
Go ahead. You can use it!

61
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,914
"Unclebunga" has a nice ring to it.

62
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,792
But I don't know about
a 35-year-old man saying it.

63
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,545
<i>I see.</i>

64
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,755
-Fujimii.
-What?

65
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,591
Can I have some coffee?

66
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,302
I'll go make some.

67
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:07,181
<i>I knew it. She's into Takafumi.</i>
<i>I have to make sure he's all right.</i>

68
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,517
Takafumi!

69
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,937
Fujimii and I went on a girls' trip.
Wanna see some pictures?

70
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,897
Yeah!

71
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,649
<i>He took the bait!</i>

72
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,901
<i>He's too close!</i>

73
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,612
Sit. Let's sit down first.

74
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,290
<i>Ogles her breasts. You're scum!</i>

75
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,462
<i>He didn't even hold back</i>
<i>from enlarging the picture!</i>

76
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,716
-Who's this guy?
-I don't know.

77
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,801
Maybe an employee?

78
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,471
Oh, good.

79
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,765
How do you like this one?

80
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,229
<i>But that's me! Why?</i>

81
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,814
Who's this man?

82
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,691
Huh? How did you even spot him?

83
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,654
You guys have been friends
since grade school, right?

84
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,740
What was Fujimii like?

85
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,117
She was edgier.

86
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,703
But she hasn't changed that much.

87
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,663
Really?

88
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,084
I'd say she was like how Chiaki is now.

89
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,419
Oh, you mean her adorable little brother?

90
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,297
It's been two years since I last saw him.

91
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,840
-He's right here.
-What?

92
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:29,555
Sawa-<i>nee</i>, let's take a video,
since I got to see you.

93
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,101
Don't worry. I won't upload it online.

94
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,439
-Are you filming now?
-Yep.

95
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,275
Oh, crap!

96
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:45,238
-What was that for, Sumi-<i>nee</i>?
-What is it?

97
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,959
Why did you do that, Fujimii?

98
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,710
<i>Had to make sure.</i>

99
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,422
<i>It's not that he swings</i>
<i>the other way, right?</i>

100
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,759
Hey, that's me!

101
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,810
Hey, Takafumi!

102
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,690
I heard you two talking about Fujimiya
as a little girl.

103
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,401
-Did you two meet in high school?
-Yeah.

104
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,486
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

105
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,822
I can show you what she looked like.

106
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,365
Wait. What's this?

107
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,117
Oh, what's that?

108
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,743
Uncle!

109
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,245
Stop!

110
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,705
Oops.

111
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,921
Spirits of memory, deliver unto oblivion.

112
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,799
-Chiaki, Sawa. Run!
-What?

113
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,136
What did he just do, Sumi-<i>nee</i>?

114
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,096
That was a Sony device!

115
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,223
Sony doesn't make devices like that!

116
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,142
Let's get out of here for now!

117
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:04,358
Uncle, you need to tone down the whole
"erasing people's memory" thing.

118
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,776
My bad.

119
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:11,407
Someone said something similar
when I was in the other world.

120
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,242
What did you do?

121
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,828
Right. It was when I was at a hot spring.

122
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,122
A hot spring?

123
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,709
The hot springs you went to
when you turned back to human?

124
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,169
-Yeah.
-What?

125
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,963
How were the hot springs
in the other world?

126
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:29,133
Any eye candy?

127
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,594
Let's see what the spirits say.

128
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,472
No nip slips allowed.

129
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:43,064
The spirit of memory adjusts the view
for the best experience.

130
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,692
It's especially careful about
personal matters like bathing.

131
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,486
Wow, that's next-level care.

132
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,446
What a considerate spirit.

133
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,864
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

134
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:16,973
Where's Elf?

135
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,892
Elf is in the women's tub.
I don't have any footage of her.

136
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,478
This is dragging on.

137
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,606
I hadn't bathed for a whole month.
I was enjoying a long soak.

138
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,067
-Another 20 minutes.
-Skip it.

139
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,528
Got it. Skipping 20 minutes.

140
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,614
-Traditional <i>yukata</i>?
-How?

141
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:36,075
-Oh, I forgot.
-<i>You took forever, orc face.</i>

142
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,868
-Hold on, not rewind.
-<i>Come on slowpoke.</i>

143
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,037
-Fast-rewind it!
-Whatever. Just hurry!

144
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,915
THRUST DOWN - TWIST
OPEN - CLOSE - SHRED

145
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,376
What was that?

146
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:49,171
I can remove armor instantaneously
using the interdimensional storage spell.

147
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,258
-A secret art in the royal Elga family.
-Royalty, huh?

148
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,927
Too late to change your tune.

149
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,055
I like <i>Guardian Heroes</i>'s Valgar

150
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,643
because his Graviton Thunder and
Zerodrive Illusion have great animation.

151
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,854
Not because of his bloodline.

152
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,814
It doesn't change who you are.

153
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,277
Yeah.

154
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,363
Anyhow, the hot spring is far.

155
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,032
We're almost there.

156
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,704
Here we are. This is it.

157
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,749
PURGATORY SPRINGS

158
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,501
It's in Japanese.
Why is there a traditional inn here?

159
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,129
Can you read Japan Bahamal writing?

160
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:33,424
Mabel was right.
Are you actually a transferee?

161
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,468
Japan Bahamal.

162
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,848
A transferee from Japan Bahamal
built this inn 20 years ago.

163
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,558
What?

164
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:44,977
What?

165
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,105
<i>There were transferees</i>
<i>aside from Uncle and Mabel's ancestor!</i>

166
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,817
That means… he's here.

167
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:58,324
Shojiro Murayama,
the transferee from 20 years ago,

168
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,285
only stayed in Granbahamal for ten days.

169
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,079
Murayama?

170
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,039
When he was 88, he passed on.

171
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,583
Is that right?

172
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,714
<i>Rengoku</i> or "Purgatory Springs," huh?

173
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,966
You're actually reading it.

174
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,094
What does "purgatory" mean?

175
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,428
To put it simply,

176
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:23,182
it's an intermediate place
between life and heaven.

177
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,395
He must've thought
he arrived in purgatory.

178
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,647
Wow, Uncle. You know big words.

179
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:30,856
Yeah, I'm impressed.

180
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,024
Well,

181
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:36,445
in the 90's, cartoon characters used
moves with difficult names.

182
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,324
I learned "purgatory" from Hiei's
Wicked King Immolation Purgatory Scorch.

183
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,785
<i>Wicked King Immolation Purgatory Scorch?</i>

184
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,914
<i>We got guests? Welcome to our inn.</i>

185
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:51,085
<i>I'm Grant, the owner and innkeeper</i>
<i>of Purgatory Springs.</i>

186
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,171
<i>You seem to know a lot</i>
<i>about the founder, miss.</i>

187
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,675
<i>Well, yes. Tales of transferees</i>
<i>are popular in my homeland.</i>

188
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:03,180
<i>Still, I'm skeptical that Shojiro built</i>
<i>this inn in ten days without help.</i>

189
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,723
<i>Are you, now?</i>

190
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:09,061
<i>Some theories say the transferee</i>
<i>brought the building from his world.</i>

191
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,688
<i>That's just not possible.</i>

192
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:14,984
<i>Transferees' belongings disappear</i>
<i>along with their bodies when they die.</i>

193
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,153
<i>When the predecessor passed on,</i>

194
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,239
<i>I watched everything</i>
<i>from his body to his shoes vanish.</i>

195
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,907
-Wow!
-New information!

196
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,661
<i>That matches the record of the warrior</i>
<i>who wielded the god-freezing sword.</i>

197
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:31,208
<i>God gifts one power</i>
<i>to transferees from other worlds.</i>

198
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:36,130
<i>My predecessor had the ability</i>
<i>to manipulate objects from nature.</i>

199
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,884
<i>He used his experience as a carpenter</i>
<i>to build this inn.</i>

200
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,803
Is Uncle sorting his inventory?

201
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,097
But they're having
a really important conversation!

202
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,724
SHOULD'VE KEPT
YOUR MOUTHS SHUT AND OBEYED

203
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:50,603
Smash-'em-ups have
long story sequences you can't skip.

204
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,398
I'm used to keeping myself busy
while waiting for it to end.

205
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,566
So that's why.

206
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,651
But that's in video games.

207
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,196
This was our chance to learn
the mysteries of transferring!

208
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,156
Let's go, orc face.

209
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,669
You and your family
are the only ones running this place?

210
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:18,881
Everything gets taken care of just fine.

211
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,051
<i>Was Murayama treated this terribly too?</i>

212
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:27,765
Uncle, when you lived in the other world,
you didn't respect the older people.

213
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,517
Now that you mention it,

214
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,102
<i>back here, he's polite to</i>
<i>even the young part-timers.</i>

215
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,398
Civility only comes
after you're seen as a person.

216
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,400
<i>Those words ring heavy.</i>

217
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:41,445
<i>He got sold off for three bronze coins</i>
<i>when he tried to be polite.</i>

218
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,658
<i>One night, two guests,</i>
<i>will be 400,000 bronze coins.</i>

219
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:48,118
400,000 bronze coins?
Isn't that a rip-off?

220
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:52,414
That's about 40,000 yen converted.
They also have higher currency.

221
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,041
Oh, never mind, then.

222
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:58,128
Wait. So when Uncle got sold off…

223
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,339
I'm worth 30 sen.

224
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,590
<i>Sen?</i>

225
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,551
<i>That's a fraction of a penny.</i>

226
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,678
We're back where we started.

227
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,347
That bath was so relaxing--

228
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,640
Skip it.

229
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,312
You figured out how to put it on.

230
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,525
I did good, didn't I?

231
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,530
I found the instructions on a 400-year-old
chronicle written by a knight.

232
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,324
Wow. You have quite the manuscript.

233
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,243
It's called a kimono, right?

234
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,371
It's a little breezy.

235
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,584
That's the room.

236
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,628
Okay. Where's my room?

237
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,672
You're with me. We're sharing it.

238
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,382
Why?

239
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,595
All the other rooms are booked.

240
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,013
Seriously?

241
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,306
Yeah.

242
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,433
I haven't seen other guests.

243
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:56,770
We have a detached room. It's built
to have privacy from other visitors.

244
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,149
I hate the thought of sharing a room,
but what can we do?

245
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,276
I thought so.

246
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:05,446
There's only one other group
staying the night,

247
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,741
so we can get another room ready… for…

248
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,913
Come on.

249
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,332
Let's go inside.

250
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,375
<i>She was just a child.</i>

251
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,211
<i>This Tsundere doesn't even care anymore.</i>

252
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,089
Wow!

253
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:27,259
We're sleeping on the floor!
How peasant-like!

254
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,597
Tatami mats! These are tatami mats, right?

255
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,600
They have a distinct smell.
Does this bring back memories?

256
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:39,063
No. My room had flooring and a bed,
so not really.

257
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,231
Good night.

258
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,529
What's this weird space in here?

259
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,240
Yeah, I've wondered the same thing.

260
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,243
-It's that weird space!
-Even though they're sharing the room!

261
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,706
I'll sleep here. Feel free
to use the room. Talk to you later.

262
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,130
I spent an entire month
chasing him for this?

263
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,465
Stupid orc.

264
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,473
You tired?

265
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,351
Hey!

266
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,561
Your leg muscles are tense.

267
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,564
I walked for miles looking for you.
So what?

268
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,275
After a bath is the ideal time
for a massage.

269
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,244
I appreciate what you did for me.

270
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,621
Without that kindness radiating
from your heart,

271
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:40,165
I could have stayed a dragon forever.

272
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,671
Ouch! Ouch!

273
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,257
Hey, stop--

274
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,217
That hurt.

275
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,220
-Ouch!
-Stop that!

276
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,188
Stop squirming.
It hurts because your muscles are tense.

277
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,446
It's my fault you're this tired.
Let me loosen you up.

278
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,656
-Ready?
-No, no!

279
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,287
Okay, it feels great!

280
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,915
Enough, you stupid orc!

281
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,252
Stop that!

282
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,879
But I was trying to--

283
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:31,258
Stop! No!

284
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,058
You're heavy. Get off of me.

285
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,481
Orc face. What?

286
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,403
Pause it!

287
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,740
Can we keep watching?
Will this lead to something?

288
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,034
-Nothing like that happens.
-But…

289
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,621
Can you hear me, great spirit of memory?

290
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:04,374
We are all adults.
Go light on the editing.

291
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,169
Skipping to the morning after is cheating.
Please.

292
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,253
Fujimiya.

293
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,880
Playing my memory now.

294
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,014
<i>Regsuuld stagga.</i>

295
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,228
<i>Stagga magna.</i>

296
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,025
What are you guys doing?

297
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,610
It was Alicia.

298
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,946
Alicia wanted to spy on you two.

299
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,366
Hey, now! I only said I'm curious!

300
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,784
The hero and her party!

301
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,870
So they're the other group
staying at the inn!

302
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,873
Kuroki, sorry.

303
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,210
Kuroki, huh?

304
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,255
I'm so sorry!

305
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:54,258
I wanted to know
if there was anything between you two.

306
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,301
What do we look like to you?

307
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,680
You two look like…

308
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,225
Really?

309
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,603
Is that what you think? Oh, no!

310
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,314
-<i>Too easy.</i>
-<i>Good thing she's easy.</i>

311
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:12,901
So you are the hero?

312
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,948
Here's your cut for slaying the hedgehog.

313
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,575
Oh, right.

314
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,201
Make sure there's enough.

315
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,328
-I'm good.
-How's this good?

316
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:29,543
Trust others all you want,
but one day it'll bite you--

317
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,129
You guys. I trust you guys.

318
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,049
Not others.

319
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,265
Wow, Edgar. Too cool!

320
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,517
Shut up, Madness Berserker.

321
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,561
Wait. So you two are like that?

322
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,357
I'll forgo the details, Hero.

323
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,278
The orc face slipped this ring
on my finger.

324
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,323
<i>She skipped all of it!</i>

325
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,450
<i>She intentionally avoided</i>
<i>telling the whole truth!</i>

326
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:05,871
He didn't give you a ring, did he?

327
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,208
Huh? Why would he?

328
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,004
Kuroki's not interested in a girl like me.

329
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,632
-You two.
-Yeah?

330
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,384
Is she a longtime friend of yours?

331
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,388
Yeah, I guess.

332
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:26,683
And which one of you plans on
winning her heart?

333
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:27,768
Elf!

334
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,520
Or should we settle this with a duel?

335
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,482
Hey… What? What?

336
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,150
What?

337
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,696
-No, thanks.
-We have the right to choose.

338
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,032
I knew,
but do they have to say it like that?

339
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,494
<i>Being childhood friends</i>
<i>isn't all that advantageous!</i>

340
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,331
<i>Why are you guys</i>
<i>up in the mountains like this?</i>

341
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:50,540
We're here to train.

342
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,294
The Labyrinth of Depths was a wake-up call
of our powerlessness.

343
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,505
The Labyrinth of Depths?

344
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,840
Thanks for this.

345
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,634
The Wand of Salvation!

346
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:04,554
According to records,
its handle is midnight black.

347
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,807
I painted it cute.

348
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,228
It's an ancient magical relic.

349
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,563
The knowledge to make
it has been lost to time.

350
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,525
There are no Moonstones left in the world.

351
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,777
You don't realize what you've done.

352
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,904
What are you guys working on?

353
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,448
We're refining our arts.

354
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,536
You mages channel spirits
and divine powers to fight.

355
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:31,665
We warriors evolve our arts
through physical training.

356
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,376
You have special techniques?
I want to see them.

357
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,877
No need to cause a scene.

358
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,629
Please!

359
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,214
What are you talking about?

360
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,717
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

361
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,553
That's Kuroki's bogus magic again.

362
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,768
Wow! How dynamic!
It's just like the fighting games!

363
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:53,854
What's that?

364
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,065
Hold on. This sheath!

365
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,402
It was dumped on the ground.
I used it to hang my laundry.

366
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,863
Nothing I can do with just the sheath.

367
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,157
I've had enough!

368
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,005
Where did you find it?

369
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,216
Atop the mountain to the north.

370
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,385
You're going now?

371
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,553
It's pretty far.

372
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,684
Hero.

373
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,022
{\an8}Don't get kidnapped.

374
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,398
{\an8}What?

375
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,618
{\an8}Wait. Why is Elf leaving all of a sudden?

376
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,995
{\an8}She learned the location
of an ancient magical relic.

377
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,121
{\an8}Ancient magical relic?

378
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,374
<i>Powerful magical weapons</i>
<i>of the ancient times.</i>

379
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,711
<i>Elf cherishes the ancient times,</i>
<i>so she collects them.</i>

380
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,297
Wow.

381
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,551
Kuroki, it's not safe for her to go alone.

382
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,470
Elf will be fine.

383
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,306
What are the chances of monsters
attacking this inn?

384
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:15,602
The owner says godly powers
were used to build this place.

385
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,604
{\an8}As long as we don't invite them in,
it's fine.

386
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,272
{\an8}You smell something burning?

387
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,833
This is…

388
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,919
