Well, she is a nice girl.

No, I pasted it into a translation app.

22
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,707

But, Takafumi…

No buts!

53
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:19,550
-Anyway, we are in a tight spot.
-Yes, we've got to figure something out.

54
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:25,014
I haven't been like this
since the Sealed City, Luvaldram.

55
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:29,018
Their defense magic was broken,
and 1,000 legendary beasts were released.

56
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,192
Uncle,

57
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:40,989
why do you mention such a fascinating tale
in a moment of crisis?

58
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,657
Do you want me to tell you?

59
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,701
Of course I do.

60
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,077
In a moment of crisis?

61
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,996
It's your fault!

62
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,331
<i>Icuras elran</i>.

63
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,669
Is this the Sealed City?

64
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,343
What an enormous barrier.

65
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,471
What is it blocking?

66
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,974
You don't know anything, do you?

67
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,644
Do you have the brains of an orc?

68
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,314
An orc?

69
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,857
-Orc.
-It's an orc!

70
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,777
Do not panic.

71
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,654
Yes, he looks exactly like an orc.

72
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,906
But if he were a real orc,

73
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:27,368
he would have perished
the moment he stepped within the barrier.

74
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,121
-That's true.
-Is he still a human?

75
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,622
This world is ending.

76
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,999
I agree.

77
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:39,672
Orc face, you're often in a spot
as if hemmed in by Chu's army.

78
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:40,757
Wait.

79
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,010
Hemmed in by Chu's army?

80
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,220
<i>The Elf girl used an idiom</i>
<i>referencing Chu.</i>

81
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,306
<i>Wasn't Chu an ancient state in China?</i>

82
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,974
<i>It must be the translation.</i>

83
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,935
LANGUAGE MENU
1 JAPANESE - 2 GRANBAHAMAL

84
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,228
<i>Irg zag lar rarla…</i>

85
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:58,483
The verbatim translation is
"Wail of Guben's army on the 10th day."

86
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,402
It doesn't make sense as is,
so the magic adapted Japanese nicely.

87
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,695
What is this interface?

88
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,656
I copied this feature
from your video player.

89
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,534
Don't you want to hide your face?

90
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,620
No.

91
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:17,627
It doesn't make me want to retch anymore
now that I'm used to it.

92
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,922
-I can tolerate…
-Wow, a giant fruit.

93
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,009
It's an <i>equa</i>, a produce of the South.

94
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,677
SEALED CITY LUVALDRAM
THE LAND WHERE BEASTS RISE

95
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,263
<i>This barrier protecting the city</i>
<i>wards off mythical beasts</i>

96
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:33,142
that dwell in the west
of the Land Where Beasts Rise.

97
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:37,230
A barrier of this scale
isn't built in one night.

98
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,524
-<i>Kilighd l'gid riolran…</i>
-The city's been a trading hub…

99
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,235
-<i>…Kulosha l'gid riolran.</i>
-…for local goods,

100
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,070
all thanks to this barrier!

101
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,161
Look at the barrier!

102
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,959
What did you do, Uncle?

103
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,212
I wanted to see if it would work.

104
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,351
-Look!
-Beasts are coming!

105
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,894
The cyclops!

106
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,105
That's a Titan!

107
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,325
Can that be a cloud dragon?

108
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,702
Bring the spell cards!

109
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,953
Which ones?

110
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,329
All of them!

111
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,878
I've only seen such terrifying monsters
in the picture books

112
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,921
from my hometown.

113
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,056
Approximately 1,000 monsters.

114
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,267
What do you think, orc face?

115
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,103
There are too many for us to handle.

116
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,023
We cannot prevent mass casualty.

117
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,608
That's correct.

118
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,964
What an ugly face.

119
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,843
But you don't hide it.

120
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,058
You are so awkward.

121
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,187
Such a fool.

122
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,439
Run.

123
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,212
<i>I put it up again.</i>

124
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,505
What?

125
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:12,176
I asked the barrier-forming spirits
to repair it and they did.

126
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,638
The spirits gave me
a hell of a time for it.

127
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,515
<i>A hell of a time?</i>

128
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,770
We lived!

129
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,855
But what was that?

130
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:27,233
I thought I saw something flashing.

131
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:30,278
Does it mean someone broke the seal?

132
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,946
Was it a beast?

133
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,406
A beast?

134
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,255
You dropped this, Elf girl.

135
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,133
Thank you. It's ancient.

136
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,678
It's a legendary weapon, right?
You've got to handle it carefully.

137
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,222
"Legendary sword" sounds cool,

138
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,142
but, at the end of the day,
it's an antique.

139
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,687
An antique.

140
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,106
The barrier's not so different.

141
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,609
No maintenance was performed
for several centuries.

142
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,819
Some failure is inevitable.

143
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,822
I heard that barrier magic books
are in the king's capital.

144
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,454
What a close call, orc face.

145
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,250
Why don't you tell them
that I broke the barrier?

146
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,382
You owe me dinner.

147
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,385
We'll call it even then.

148
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,230
<i>I took off.</i>

149
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,940
Why the hell you did run?

150
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,818
It's critical to deter
these types of jerks

151
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,655
from extorting on the very first attempt.

152
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,574
<i>Otherwise, you'll be a sucker forever.</i>

153
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,703
All right, orc face.
Next, fetch me some pastries.

154
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,290
<i>His skepticism runs deep.</i>

155
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:12,546
Ask the spirits.

156
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,926
What are you doing?

157
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:21,097
I thought I'd ask my viewers to subscribe.

158
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,681
What?

159
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:27,478
I explained I need them to help
by subscribing to my channel.

160
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,815
What a stupid thing you've done!

161
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,566
You're done if you show your weakness.

162
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,403
Those trolls will start a flame war
and grill you to the bone.

163
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,489
Internet trolls who make money from hating
will come after you.

164
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,408
You are finished!

165
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,618
Uncle, you are so done!

166
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,128
I SUBSCRIBED. KEEP GOING!

167
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,212

00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,585
Sure.

179
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,504
What's going on?

180
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,923
ORC FACE QUICKLY TRANSFORM

181
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:43,387
<i>The aging, unemployed singles</i>
<i>are becoming a serious social problem.</i>

182
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,974
For example, an unemployed uncle
crashing at his nephew's place,

183
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,059
wrecking the young man's life.

184
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,103
Unthinkable, right?

185
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,688
I totally agree.

186
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:57,401
Wow, the new video
already reached 10,000 views.

187
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:02,531
Is being a YouTuber considered a career?

188
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,867
The revenue comes only from ads, right?

189
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,994
Yeah.

190
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,788
That's a commonly asked question.

191
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,375
I'm a pro
collaborating with a corporation,

192
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,461
so I can't disclose the details.

193
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,296
Sorry.

194
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,674
With a roommate…

195
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:27,097
Takafumi can't even consider
living with a girlfriend.

196
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:33,354
Oh, yeah, Fujimiya. You should live here.

197
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,066
Takafumi's room sleeps two.

198
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,526
Wait!

199
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,486
-I don't mind sleeping on the floor.
-Wait!

200
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,988
Having two men in my room is a bit tight.

201
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,533
It's not that spacious.

202
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,617
Really?

203
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,123
Sorry, I need to go out for a bit.

204
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,292
What? Wait!

205
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,087
Sugarless jam, 198 yen.

206
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,050
That Takafumi.

207
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:08,681
Despite a wonderful girl such as you
showing interest in him,

208
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,058
he only sees you as a friend.

209
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,521
Did something happen in the past?

210
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,982
Huh?

211
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,568
-You can talk to me.
-No, thank you.

212
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:25,489
Surely my experience of sacrificing
my love countless times means something.

213
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,241
Kaede, at least go with my hands.

214
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,201
<i>Surely there are things</i>
<i>only I can tell you.</i>

215
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,661
No way!

216
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:34,123
I have nothing to confide to someone whose
experience only comes from video games.

217
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,886
I'm not good enough for you.

218
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,725
<i>He is a weirdo.</i>

219
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:57,980
<i>But he has good intentions</i>
<i>to try to bring us together.</i>

220
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,319
I was too harsh earlier.

221
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,781
What?

222
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,242
Who… are you?

223
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,245
I am Takafumi's aunt.

224
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:14,538
His aunt?

225
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,207
Why is his aunt here?

226
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:21,670
His uncle is here. Why not his aunt?

227
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,257
Where is Uncle?

228
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,425
He's in the bathroom.

229
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,470
Help me, Spirit of Sound.

230
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,848
I'm here.

231
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,351
Okay, let's talk.

232
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,561
-I mean, let's have a chat.
-What?

233
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:41,482
It's time for girl talk.
No need to hold back.

234
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,567
So, tell me, what happened in the past?

235
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,029
Nothing. Seriously, nothing happened.

236
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,658
I'm back.

237
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,584
AND HERE WE ARE NOW

238
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,338
It's Takafumi.

239
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,799
Your aunt wants to give me
relationship advice.

240
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,717
What? My aunt?

241
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,761
<i>Relationship advice?</i>

242
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,351
Uncle?

243
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,936
No, I'm your aunt.

244
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,230
Sonic and Tailz are--

245
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,066
No, it's Tails with an S.

246
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,403
His real name is Miles Prower, but
he goes by "Tails," as he has two tails.

247
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:28,946
-Uncle.
-I'm your aunt.

248
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,702
You could have used this magic to change
your appearance in the other world.

249
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,328
Don't make it sound easy.

250
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,165
The mind gradually changes
to conform to the body.

251
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,712
There is a risk
that I can lose my identity.

252
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,258
Unless absolutely necessary,

253
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,719
this magic is forbidden!

254
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,304
<i>And you are using it for a girl talk.</i>

255
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,931
Well…

256
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,143
Whatever. Let's shoot a YouTube video.

257
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,814
No, now's not the time.

258
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,608
Fujimiya is here,
so we should entertain her.

259
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,944
Let's shoot a gaming video
with Guardian Heroes.

260
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,446
I'll do it!

261
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:13,949
I've been wanting to shoot a gaming video.

262
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,410
Yay!

263
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,496
We don't have time,
so keep your face like that.

264
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,957
All right, let's get started.

265
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,668
What is going on?

266
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,007
All right.
The video is successfully uploaded.

267
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,969
I'm not as good as I once was
but kept an entertaining play style.

268
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,263
I think we'll get tons of likes.

269
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,973
Can I see the video?

270
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,351
Uncle, before we get to that,
we need to entertain Fujimiya.

271
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,270
Right, I forgot.

272
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:45,439
Uncle? Not aunt?

273
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,733
All right.

274
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,779
Let's review Takafumi and Fujimiya's
earliest encounters.

275
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,906
You cut right to the chase, Uncle.

276
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,783
Let's start, Takafumi.

277
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:59,161
Spirit of Memory,
show me a fragment of the recollections.

278
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,501
-What the heck is this?
-It's magic.

279
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,878
Stop kidding me.

280
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,339
Oh, this must be a hologram! Right?

281
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,841
I've seen this in movies.

282
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,096
Yeah.

283
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,681
This Sony machine projects the image here.

284
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,851
So it's by Sony.

285
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,272
That's our elementary school
before it was renovated.

286
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,486
<i>I bet you have erotic magazines</i>
<i>stashed at home!</i>

287
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,488
<i>I don't have them.</i>

288
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,992
Wow, I want one of these devices.

289
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,662
<i>Don't talk back to me!</i>

290
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,873
<i>-Crap bomb punches!</i>
<i>-Ouch, ouch!</i>

291
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,418
Strange. Where is Fujimiya?

292
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,504
There's only a filthy brat.

293
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,339
That's you, Fujimiya.

294
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,842
What?

295
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,309
Oh, I see. Yeah, that makes sense.

296
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:07,604
<i>What? Was I really like this?</i>

297
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,316
<i>I thought we had</i>
<i>a more bittersweet childhood together.</i>

298
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,406
<i>Here's poop.</i>

299
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,824
Wait, what?

300
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,618
Fujimiya, I'm so sorry.

301
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,620
This is hopeless.

302
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,622
Don't watch it!

303
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,585
Incredible of Takafumi to notice you
when he saw you on the street.

304
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,754
Of course I would.

305
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,719
I wouldn't forget Fujimiya.

306
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,476
Yeah, right.

307
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,145
Ouch. What's this for?

308
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,105
I see.

309
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,699
It's not about the appearance.

310
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,704
Had I been able to see that, maybe…

311
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,372
Oh, no.

312
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,292
Is this body affecting my mind?

313
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,045
<i>Please stop, Mr. Fujimiya.</i>

314
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,380
-You called me Mr. Fujimiya.
-<i>Poop, poop!</i>

315
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,425
I seriously thought you were a boy
for a while after we met.

316
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,927
That's horrible!

317
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,724
That's the video we uploaded just now.

318
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,768

<i>I'll play up to obtaining</i>

<i>All right, now…</i>

330
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,676
Wait a minute, Takafumi.

331
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,097
My game's screen isn't shown at all
in the video we just shot.

332
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,640
Why would anyone watch this?
