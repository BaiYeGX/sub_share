1
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,850
The number of views has been declining.

2
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:17,934
{\an8}FIRE VS ICE

3
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,812
{\an8}The latest video, Gas flame vs Ice magic,
seems unpopular.

4
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,399
The comments were harsh, like,
"A pointless waste of resources."

5
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:27,152
We must tighten up our budget from today.

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,239
I will stop bidding on online auctions.

7
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:33,867
-What's that?
-I got it at last.

8
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,957
This magazine listed the final result
of SEGA SATURN readers' choice.

9
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,544
Unfortunately, I hadn't had the chance
to see the results.

10
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,628
{\an8}COLLECTOR'S EDITION

11
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,213
{\an8}I couldn't die without knowing it.

12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:51,634
Maybe this desire kept me alive
in the harsh other world.

13
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,762
<i>Such a silly thing kept you alive?</i>

14
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:54,971
-Takafumi.
-What?

15
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,431
The results are here.

16
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,433
The last page of SEGA SATURN's history is…

17
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,684
SATURN GAMES
ARE THE WORLD'S #1

18
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,102
…in this magazine.

19
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,191
<i>Stunningly, I don't care.</i>

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,152
The very last game
that came in the first place was…

21
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,029
Are you reading it already?

22
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,911
Oh, the winner was a <i>bishojo</i> game
ported from the PC version.

23
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,580
I guess the results weren't
what you hoped for.

24
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,999
No, I'm not complaining.

25
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:26,419
I can agree with the ranking
as I read the reviews.

26
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,840
But I feel sad, as if I were watching
wild, macho high-school boys

27
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,676
<i>getting tamed by girlfriends.</i>

28
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,761
<i>Really?</i>

29
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,805
-Not really.
-What?

30
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:06,376
<i>Guardian Heroes</i> should have been
number one!

31
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:10,964
It adopted the fighting game system into
a side-scroller while maintaining balance.

32
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,800
Its innovation and perfection
has got to be recognized!

33
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,762
197th place? What?

34
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:22,350
197th place?

35
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,232
{\an8}UNCLE:
YOU'RE FINE THE WAY YOU ARE

36
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,140
GET HOME

37
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,396
SOLD CHEAPER THAN A SCOURING PAD

38
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,869
One of the original SATURN RPGs
was placed in second.

39
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,122
I didn't play RPG at all.

40
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,207
What?

41
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,583
The beginning went okay.

42
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,001
YOU NEED SALT TO KILL SLUGS

43
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,420
<i>But I couldn't remember what I did</i>
<i>the day before…</i>

44
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:15,713
WHY DO I NEED SALT?

45
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,048
<i>…and got lost.</i>

46
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,800
Did you?

47
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:23,596
I mean, I had an encounter
like an RPG game in the other world.

48
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,847
What?

49
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,432
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

50
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:31,062
<i>You fucking orc.</i>
<i>I won't lose to a fugly pig like you.</i>

51
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,647
What is this?

52
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,566
This was the time right after I arrived
at the village.

53
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,193
Let's fast-forward it.

54
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,699
<i>Uncle, whenever you got to a village,</i>
<i>you found yourself in a battle.</i>

55
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:46,244
<i>Well, in the flame shrine</i>
<i>at the west end of the village,</i>

56
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:49,247
<i>the legendary blaze dragon has roused.</i>

57
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,542
<i>The village will be burned down</i>
<i>if we don't do anything.</i>

58
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:58,256
<i>The only way to slay the blaze dragon is</i>
<i>using the Ice clan's god freezing sword.</i>

59
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:03,219
However, the descendant of the Ice clan
is a bit of a pain in the neck.

60
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,943
Her name is Mabel.

61
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,821
Unless we melt the ice,
trapping her heart,

62
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,407
we can't break the seal
of the god freezing sword.

63
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,038
When I was little,

64
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:34,042
I saw powa-powa blossoms with my mom
at the top of Mount Marchid.

65
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,004
That was beautiful.

66
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:56,105
I went straight to the shrine of flame
and slew the legendary blaze dragon.

67
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:57,982
<i>How come?</i>

68
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:03,029
Seriously, it was hard. But I killed it
after I got its offensive strategy down.

69
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:07,408
Not like that! You should've gone
to Mount Marchid for powa-powa blossoms.

70
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,077
I couldn't remember that.

71
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,995
It's not that complicated.

72
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,582
<i>What?</i>
<i>You defeated the legendary blaze dragon?</i>

73
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,300
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

74
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,010
They were so grateful.

75
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:28,846
Yeah.

76
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,393
I got it.

77
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,152
<i>SEGA SATURN Console and 20 games.</i>

78
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,781
Takafumi, was that a package delivery?

79
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:50,243
Oh, well… this is…

80
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,208
<i>It was a surprise gift for him,</i>
<i>but he just said we've got to save up.</i>

81
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,718
This…

82
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,803
What?

83
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:15,309
Huh?

84
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,272
<i>Is he happy or furious?</i>

85
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:23,776
It's a bit early,
but happy birthday, Uncle.

86
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,903
Oh, by the way…

87
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,825
I found <i>Guardian Heroes</i>.

88
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,711
Want to play?

89
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,254
<i>I worried in vain.</i>

90
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:48,301
<i>For my uncle, spending money</i>
<i>on a SEGA console can't be a waste.</i>

91
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,235
The town trampled down in <i>Alien Storm</i>
looked like this.

92
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,030
When it is deserted and chilly,

93
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,115
I can feel the tension in the air.

94
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,161
Yeah. It's totally different
from New Year's Eve in the other world.

95
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,455
What? Uncle!

96
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,251
-Do you want to know?
-Yes.

97
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:31,260
"If aliens were to invade the earth now,

98
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:35,640
would you be an ordinary citizen
who runs for your life, or"…

99
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:37,183
That was the tagline of the game.

100
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,645
-Players, as one of the Alien Busters--
-No, not the game!

101
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,107
Is that a comic magazine?

102
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:49,654
Yeah. I haven't spent New Year's Eve
reading a manga in a long time.

103
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,948
Can you follow the story
after a 17-year break?

104
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,408
<i>KochiKame</i> would follow the same plot
all the time.

105
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,035
<i>KochiKame</i>'s serialization is over.

106
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,621
Really? I never thought it would end.

107
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,335
You won't find it.

108
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,881
I'm more interested in the story
of the other world than the manga.

109
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,593
Not on the contents page either.

110
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,844
Seriously?

111
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,597
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

112
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:21,352
It's not a big deal, but it's something
like a New Year's Eve party.

113
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,187
It's a thanksgiving festival

114
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,439
for the gods' protection
against the hardships of winter.

115
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,400
The lord would feed you a splendid dinner.

116
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,484
<i>Cheers!</i>

117
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,486
That's some feast.

118
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,575
The residents of the other world
were pumped up for this festival.

119
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,286
For the festival, I also…

120
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:41,956
<i>All right, we gonna have a great time!</i>

121
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,374
<i>Yeah!</i>

122
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,211
Well, I wish I could be like that.

123
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:59,015
I couldn't be a totally different person
from who I was.

124
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,768
I ate alone and went back to my room.

125
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,690
What?

126
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,319
It was great.
I enjoyed the roasted chicken--

127
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,614
I'm not talking about the food.
Was that all for the festival?

128
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,490
-Yeah.
-Where was she? The <i>tsun--</i>

129
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,825
The bad-mouthing girl?

130
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,412
She was not there,
and nothing happened after that.

131
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,842
Do you wanna play on the SATURN?

132
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,510
Let's do that!

133
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,431
Pew pew!

134
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,433
You'll break the buttons.

135
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:46,646
By the way, Mabel came to my room
after the festival.

136
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,481
The protector of the god freezing sword.

137
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,024
Now, the battle begins!

138
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,610
I want to hear about that!

139
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:56,030
-I thought we finally finished talking--
-Hurry up!

140
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,825
Well… nothing really happened.

141
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,077
See?

142
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,920
MEMORY -
SHOW A PIECE OF YOURSELF

143
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,798
Why are you here?

144
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,551
I wanted you to tell me.

145
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:23,265
You slew the dragon single-handedly.
I want to be strong like you.

146
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:27,812
How can I stop being a coward?

147
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,772
"Stop being a coward"?

148
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,150
Who said that you are a coward?

149
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,903
-What?
-Who said that?

150
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,657
The village mayor.

151
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,119
Live your life the way you want to,

152
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,581
not by someone else's ways.

153
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,382
I believe strength is the power
to carry this through.

154
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,974
<i>Great. That's so cool, Uncle.</i>

155
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,227
<i>Mabel being like this!</i>

156
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:14,316
<i>Like this, Uncle must have gradually built</i>
<i>relationships in the other world.</i>

157
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,403
How have you spent your life until now?

158
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:25,369
I have been a recluse
and closed off my heart.

159
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,831
That's fine.

160
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,208
What? But…

161
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,335
That's completely fine.

162
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,922
No matter what people said,
I never gave up being a SEGA user

163
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,674
and never will.

164
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:44,638
Is your role to be an ordinary citizen
who buys a popular console?

165
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,932
Or…

166
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,272
Are you sure?

167
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,524
Yes, I'm sure.

168
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,117
<i>Incredible!</i>

169
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:09,205
-She chose her life and went back home.
-<i>I'm so happy to stay reclusive.</i>

170
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,332
Oh, she gave me the sword.

171
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:15,044
-<i>Please keep the god freezing sword.</i>
-<i>Thanks, but no thanks. It's cold.</i>

172
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,962
<i>Really?</i>

173
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,672
No, I declined the offer.

174
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:21,050
Well… that's about it.

175
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,764
Uncle, would you care for
a bowl of soba noodles?

176
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,475
That's a good idea. Let's boil the water.

177
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,817
What did you do on New Year's Eve
when you were a student? Play games?

178
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,821
Well, I watched TV. Something like
an <i>It's Okay to Laugh!</i> special episode.

179
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,866
It was a special occasion
as students couldn't watch daytime shows.

180
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,576
That show ended too.

181
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,870
Seriously? How is that possible?

182
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:50,955
<i>Finito.</i>

183
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:54,542
Well, it's been 17 years. No wonder.

184
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,460
But the show was on until three years ago.

185
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,671
It lasted that long? That's awesome!

186
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:01,423
-<i>KochiKame</i> ended last year.
-What?

187
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,801
What kind of shows do you like, Takafumi?

188
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,303
I don't think you've watched it,
but <i>Not Okay to Laugh</i>.

189
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,514
No way! What happened with Tamori?

190
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,683
It's not the sequel.

191
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,310
<i>It seems like he'd watched TV a lot.</i>

192
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,731
<i>Playing games, chatting,</i>
<i>and slurping soba…</i>

193
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,483
<i>and that's how the new year rolled in.</i>

194
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,239
JANUARY, 2018

195
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,378
The breeze you just made was quite sharp.

196
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,632
Let's keep it that way all day today.

197
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,846
No way, you are kidding again.

198
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,182
<i>I should avoid this street from now on.</i>

199
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,350
Fujimiya?

200
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,440
Takafumi?

201
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,067
I thought so!

202
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,611
You can't be this tall!

203
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,323
I hit a growth spurt in high school.
It's been such a long time.

204
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,408
Yeah.

205
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,295
How are you doing these days?

206
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,547
A lot happened, and I'm working part-time.

207
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,966
I see. I'm going to college.

208
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,093
It's chilly.

209
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,305
Do you wanna stop by my place?
It's close by.

210
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,849
Your parents' house?

211
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
No.

212
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,898
I'll come by
after dropping off the groceries.

213
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:43,484
Okay, here is the address.

214
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,528
30 MINUTES LATER

215
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,075
Takafumi?

216
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:55,996
{\an8}TAKAFUMI:
I'M GRABBING SOME SNACKS.

217
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,456
{\an8}GO INSIDE WITHOUT ME.
THE DOOR'S UNLOCKED.

218
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,544
Hi, I'm coming in.

219
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,710
<i>Stonagas resto rarbarum.</i>

220
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,049
<i>Icuras cuora.</i>

221
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,596
<i>Icuras cuora. Icuras cuora.</i>

222
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,973
Gotta use Japanese.

223
00:16:56,056 --> 00:17:01,228
-Spirits of memory, deliver unto oblivion.
-Uncle!

224
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,861
Takafumi, the enemy… She saw it.

225
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,697
Erase-- Erasing her memory faster,

226
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,200
-means less impact on her mind.
-She's my friend!

227
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,914
A… friend?

228
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,626
Thank you for being friends with Takafumi.

229
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,716
-Well, that was…
-I cast in Granbahamal lingo.

230
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,800
Like a dialect?

231
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,388
So, Takafumi is supporting an uncle
who hasn't worked for 17 years.

232
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:39,767
I am a YouTuber.

233
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:43,771
I saw him mumbling to himself out there.

234
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:47,107
Occasionally, I chat with spirits
to sharpen my magic skills.

235
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,359
He's seriously crazy!

236
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,403
Yes, it's crazy.

237
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,407
Because he returned from another world
and does magic.

238
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,327
I practice magic
and my YouTube channel showcases it.

239
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,997
Then do the goddamn magic now!

240
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,085
Well… I can't do it for free.
I'm a YouTuber with two million views.

241
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,377
-Right?
-Yeah.

242
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,838
<i>What is the basis of his professionalism?</i>

243
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:15,177
Anyway, you shouldn't hinder
Takafumi's life anymore.

244
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,388
Oh, I see.

245
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,809
You like Takafumi.

246
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,105
No, no, no, no, no. It's not that.

247
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,482
100% no. We are just friends.

248
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,945
It shouldn't be the case.
I understand mature love.

249
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,908
I watched the entire <i>Evangelion</i> series
when I was in junior high.

250
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,576
You watched <i>Eva</i>?

251
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,162
Yes, I did. Everyone did.

252
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,129
At that time, SEGA was one of the sponsors
of <i>Evangelion.</i>

253
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,089
<i>In the end, it's because of SEGA.</i>

254
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,175
<i>Well, then you know Asuka too?</i>

255
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,927
<i>The girl in the red suit, right?</i>

256
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,015
<i>Oh, shit! Uncle may catch on</i>
<i>to the</i> tsundere <i>concept!</i>

257
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,144
Don't you misunderstand.
You are indebted to me now.

258
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,979
That's not what I meant.

259
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,606
I didn't mean "together forever"
or anything.

260
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,985
<i>He may realize what</i>
<i>that elfin girl really meant.</i>

261
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,070
Did you know?

262
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,283
Actually, Asuka has a crush on Kaji.

263
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,664
Sorry, Takafumi,
you may be too inexperienced

264
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,208
to notice her crush on Kaji.

265
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:30,085
What? Yeah.

266
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,505
{\an8}SO SHALLOW…!!!

267
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,008
Stop fooling around already.

268
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,636
Don't make assumptions
based on an anime's views on love.

269
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,681
You're right. Let's talk about real love.

270
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,643
Her name was Kaede Nanase.

271
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,732
The enemy stole her mind,
and she lost her old self.

272
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:57,779
Her affection soon turned
into lethal intention in battle.

273
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,200
However, after a long battle,
she got a sure response.

274
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:02,743
Joy.

275
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,538
She regained herself
under the bursting flash.

276
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:10,542
"Who did I kill?"

277
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,420
"What did I lose?"

278
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:19,676
There is no such a thing as "too early"
to express your affection.

279
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,970
Oh, my God.

280
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,933
<i>The resolution gap between anime</i>
<i>and games is too big.</i>

281
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:27,601
Hey, Fujimiya.

282
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,852
What?

283
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,355
That was just a story from a video game.

284
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,439
Wow--

285
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,984
-Just a fiction?
-A fiction?

286
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,444
No, I experienced it firsthand.

287
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,655
You, shut your…

288
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,956
Spirits of memory, investigate now.

289
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,378
"Geez, he has a roommate. I feel stupid
for being psyched and changing my outfit."

290
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,672
-What?
-True, you're wearing a different outfit.

291
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,839
No, it's the same one.

292
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,424
You even took a shower.

293
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,926
No, I didn't.

294
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,263
Who is there?

295
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,101
A mind reader, or con man?

296
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,480
What are you?

297
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,528
I am just an uncle…

298
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,780
back from another world--

299
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,241
Mr. Shibazaki, I got a package for you.

300
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,868
-Mr. Shibazaki?
-I'm coming.

301
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:27,953
Mr. Shibazaki?

302
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,080
You've got to cut ties, Takafumi.

303
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,708
Seriously, you need to get out.

304
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,627
If you can't afford the rent,
I will cover it by taking on a job.

305
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,921
-Seriously? Want to be my roommate?
-What?

306
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,341
-I see, that's definitely an option.
-Well, I didn't mean that--

307
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,969
But I've got my uncle with me.

308
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:49,308
What's in there?
This box weighs 15 kilograms.

309
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,768
-It's a bag of rice.
-Rice?

310
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,771
Can you accept my scribbled signature?

311
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,985
<i>One additional person now knows</i>
<i>my uncle in real life.</i>

312
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,947
<i>He looked somewhat more cheerful</i>
<i>than his usual self.</i>

313
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,368
<i>And I'll refrain from buying rice online…</i>

314
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,495
<i>I felt a lethal intent.</i>

315
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:40,919
