1
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,005
The blaze…

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,424
Dragon?

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,385
{\an8}Orc face, you can't possibly…

4
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:11,511
{\an8}Yes.

5
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:15,390
{\an8}I'm tired of fighting a formless being.

6
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,975
The blaze dragon.

7
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:22,856
The dragon will absorb
this being's divine healing magic.

8
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,149
Then we strike!

9
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,400
Say…

10
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:28,862
{\an8}Alicia? Raiga and Edgar too.

11
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,198
{\an8}The blaze dragon revived
by highly concentrated divine magic…

12
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:37,245
{\an8}Not only does its flame negate any attack
and cause instant death,

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,709
if we get too close, the dragon can use
control spells and turn us into puppets.

14
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,502
So, how do we defeat it?

15
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,921
-What?
-Huh?

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,631
Huh?

17
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,509
What?

18
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,267
{\an8}-What?
-What?

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,898
-What do you mean, "What?"
-He didn't even have a plan!

20
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:08,568
How can we possibly defeat the
blaze dragon, imbued with divine power?

21
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:15,033
Don't sweat it. We have Mabel
and her god-freezing sword.

22
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,701
The god-freezing sword?

23
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,038
The one weapon said to be
effective against the blaze dragon?

24
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,920
-Holy cow.
-Get a grip!

25
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,590
You're from the legendary Ice clan,
aren't you?

26
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,884
Hey. Cut that out, you two.

27
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,512
Shut your pie hole.

28
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,722
It's still scary, despite all that.

29
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:40,433
You're sure asking me to shave off
your chicken comb and side part.

30
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,644
Don't you know
I used to be an appointed Knight!

31
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,854
Speak up so they can hear you.

32
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,607
The god-freezing sword
isn't gonna work for us.

33
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,817
Wait, really?

34
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,485
Don't make me the bad guy,

35
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,862
you damn rooster-head.

36
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:56,032
If you want to say something,
speak up, okay?

37
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,034
We're screwed! What do we do now?

38
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,745
Damn it. We can't go up
against a monster that huge--

39
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,830
-We have a chance.
-What?

40
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,919
-Seriously?
-But how?

41
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,003
It's simple.

42
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:12,966
We'll attack with such power and speed
that we surpass its ability to regenerate.

43
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:14,551
-What?
-What?

44
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,344
The sword's an ancient magical relic.

45
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:19,139
It stores pulses of energy
and then releases it at once.

46
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:24,686
Usually, it harnesses the lightning magic
stored in my armor.

47
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,813
Instead, we'll pour

48
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:31,359
orc face's ridiculously destructive magic
power into it, then release all at once.

49
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,070
Shall we call that thing
the evolved blaze dragon?

50
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,073
We can defeat it.

51
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,450
Rest assured.

52
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:44,455
But if we get close to it,
the dragon will put us under its control.

53
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:49,127
No matter. The gem embedded
in my circlet negates such magic.

54
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,088
What about its scales?
They deflect all attacks.

55
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,633
If we attack while being scorched,
we will deal damage.

56
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,344
-Oh, while being scorched…
-Okay, while being scorched…

57
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,723
Nobody can survive that!

58
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,850
That dragon's breath causes instant death,
you know!

59
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,561
We know the solution.

60
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,521
We'll use magic to block its breath.

61
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,606
That's how I beat it.

62
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,983
Yes, he didn't even use
the god-freezing sword.

63
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:16,779
So you two have beaten the blaze dragon
before? Without the god-freezing sword?

64
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,532
Orc face is the one
who slew the actual dragon.

65
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,827
Either way, he didn't use
the god-freezing sword.

66
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,873
Wow, the god-freezing sword is useless.

67
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,876
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

68
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,796
I haven't told Raiga and Edgar

69
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,467
that you're the one who defeated
the goblin horde.

70
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,638
Oh, forget it. Keeping it in the dark
works better for me.

71
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,056
Huh? But…

72
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,101
Never mind that. Remember how
I erased my memory at the hot spring?

73
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,937
Right, I was naked--

74
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,439
No way.

75
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,943
<i>Icuras cuora.</i>

76
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,864
Let me recall what happened.
Will you show me what you did?

77
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,203
-I can't.
-What?

78
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,039
Maybe later, back at the inn--

79
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,875
-Mabel.
-Huh? What?

80
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,463
You still haven't been introduced
to our celebrity friends!

81
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,382
Aren't you a little loud, Elf?

82
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,592
Raiga, Edgar, Alicia.

83
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,928
Their character class is obvious.

84
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,265
Why the half-assed introduction now?
We're in serious danger.

85
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,852
Right, we're in serious danger.
So why were you two fooling around?

86
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,980
You've misunderstood, it's because--

87
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:37,777
I am she who wields and protects
the legendary god-freezing sword.

88
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,906
Mabel Rayveil. That's my name.

89
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,616
-How cool!
-Huh?

90
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,202
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mabel.

91
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,829
-Hey.
-Good to meet you.

92
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,209
Sure. I used to be an appointed
knight of the kingdom,

93
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,422
a rank you vagrant adventurers will never
achieve, not even in a million years!

94
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,882
And with that, it's great to meet you too!

95
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,930
-Great to meet you.
-Pleased to meet you.

96
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,599
Are they actually pleased?

97
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:11,352
Isn't she a homeless bum right now?

98
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,771
<i>It's rising!</i>

99
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,194
-Shall we do this, Elvish lady?
-No, not yet.

100
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,990
Defeat it while it's morphing,
and it may regress to its formless power.

101
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,743
Hold your positions while it regenerates.

102
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,202
-Roger!
-Got it.

103
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:29,954
Now, orc face.

104
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:34,792
What?

105
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,592
I need to save my energy for the fight.

106
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,929
I'd rather die than have you carry me,
but we have no other choice.

107
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,931
Now, get to it.

108
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,949
Give me a break, this is bullshit.

109
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:10,369
You'd hurl a pile of rubbish
with more care.

110
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,705
Finally, we're ready.

111
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:14,832
Does this mean

112
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:18,044
that I don't have to do anything?

113
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,505
Huh?

114
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,215
She's nuts!

115
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,467
What a bright smile.

116
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,595
Well, I'll just stay out of your way.

117
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,273
It's glaring right at her.

118
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,984
The blaze dragon's grudge against
the Ice clan runs deep.

119
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,821
-Mabel, you're the bait.
-What?

120
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,532
This will make the fight much easier.

121
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,993
Don't worry, we'll back you up.

122
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,917
Here it comes!

123
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,547
Whatever, I'll be the bait!

124
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,134
That blaze has got nothing
on my god-freezing sword!

125
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,929
-Rock!
-Leave it to me.

126
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,849
Slash Engage.

127
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,102
Tempest…

128
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,729
Caliber!

129
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,240
I'll protect you.

130
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,951
Mine! That was my skill!

131
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,077
Okay.

132
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,622
Good, they've got the dragon's attention.

133
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,666
-It's coming at us again!
-Leave it to me!

134
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,918
Strike Engage. Ashura Ouga Strike!

135
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,837
That's my skill too!

136
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,966
You're not sure about this, are you?

137
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,555
What happened to your confidence?
Or was that a lie?

138
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,765
Why?

139
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,602
It was the only way…

140
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,814
to not succumb to fear and keep going.

141
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,442
I won't let our friends…

142
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,825
taste the bitter cup of defeat.

143
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,791
I see. I hadn't considered that.

144
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,753
It's coming this way!

145
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,087
Run!

146
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,797
Impulse Caliber!

147
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,383
Did it work?

148
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,136
Yes, it backed off!

149
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,554
You did it, Edgar!

150
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,480
Sorry, but I can't promise we'll win.
What a pinch.

151
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:45,149
I'm trying to come up
with a strategy myself, but…

152
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,484
Hey now!

153
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,196
Don't you mean, "A pinch is a chance"?

154
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,033
"A pinch is a chance."

155
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,078
Isn't that your motto?

156
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:02,375
Elf, I thought you hadn't
cared about anything I had to say.

157
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,221
Shall we do this, Sui?

158
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,099
Back me up, Yousuke.

159
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,767
Pause it, Uncle.

160
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,061
What is it, Takafumi?

161
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,355
Finally…

162
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,777
Finally,
a real parallel-world fantasy battle.

163
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,449
-Care for a coffee?
-Yes.

164
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:40,204
<i>There's not a man in the world who doesn't</i>
<i>like parallel-world fantasy battles.</i>

165
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,872
Oh, I ought to go relieve myself.

166
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,334
<i>I'm not an exception to the rule.</i>
<i>I love 'em!</i>

167
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,920
{\an8}JAPANESE SYLLABARY

168
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,882
<i>Ten months have passed</i>
<i>since Uncle woke up from his coma.</i>

169
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,595
<i>I finally get a taste of the fantasy-world</i>
<i>battle I've been dying to see.</i>

170
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,973
You sure love parallel-world
fantasies, huh?

171
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,767
-Ready? I'm starting.
-Okay!

172
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,982
Shall we do this, Sui?

173
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,860
Back me up, Yousuke.

174
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,621
-Breath!
-We strike first. It's gonna get hot!

175
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,626
<i>Baraibhut zal sherion.</i>

176
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,219
His super attacks are his blazing breath
and tail!

177
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,930
Not to mention its claw strike,
which it does at random!

178
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,390
Wait for its claw!

179
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,642
I know!

180
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,893
Now's our chance!

181
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,479
<i>War-grent sladseld.</i>

182
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,415
Drown in the icy blade and sleep.

183
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,258
<i>Lugardos golet bastohl.</i>

184
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,225
Heavy projectile mode.

185
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,259
Ultra-distance cosmic shot!

186
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,484
Hey, you should've mentioned
you won't have power left to fly!

187
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,280
Boo-hoo, you're panicked!

188
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:04,992
You…

189
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,918
We did it, Yousuke!

190
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,753
What? I can't hear you.

191
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:19,173
-I said we did it, Yousuke!
-What?

192
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,474
We did it…

193
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,105
Yousuke.

194
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,348
You smell like smoke.

195
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,309
Like the incinerators
from back in grade school.

196
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,436
Stop sniffing!

197
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,564
I said stop!

198
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,274
Hey, hold your horses!

199
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,985
What are they doing up there?

200
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,279
-Damn!
-They hit the ground!

201
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:29,785
Jeez.

202
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,788
It's always trouble with you.

203
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,001
Blaze dragon?

204
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,337
It's completely fused
with the unrestrained divine power.

205
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,339
Holding on to it is dangerous.

206
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,467
What if it rises again and fuses
with an even more dangerous power?

207
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,636
-That's exactly what I want.
-What?

208
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,888
Hey!

209
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:52,099
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

210
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,726
You two are still alive.

211
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,853
Yeah, somehow.

212
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,319
Hey, wasn't I a great support?

213
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,155
I did it! Go on, praise me.

214
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,074
-Yeah, you did good.
-What?

215
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,787
Without you guys, I would've spent about
four months to finish off the dragon.

216
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,999
I may have caused some damage
to the surrounding settlements.

217
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,251
It's thanks to all of you.

218
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,923
Thank you.

219
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,719
Especially you, Mabel.

220
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,932
You were scared out of your wits,
but you stayed and fought.

221
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,850
You live up to the legacy of the Ice clan.

222
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,688
Look at that, Mabel. He praised you.

223
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,320
What was that?

224
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,614
"I wish you would carry me
like you did to Elf"?

225
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,158
Wait! Hey, Mabel!

226
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,036
So, Alicia, did you want to fly?

227
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,289
Sorry, but I used up
the spirits' powers for the day.

228
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,458
Yeah, I figured.

229
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,420
-Wait, what--
-No binding spell.

230
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,716
I'm scared!

231
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,344
Kuroki, let me down!

232
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,180
Stop squirming, you're heavy!

233
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,183
I said, put me down!

234
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,143
Oh, enough flying for you?

235
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,771
That's not fair!

236
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,272
Let me fly too!

237
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,233
Okay, let's get both of you in one go.

238
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,068
-Really?
-Mabel!

239
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,320
Mabel?

240
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,949
Awesome!

241
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,660
-I thought…
-I feel queasy.

242
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,870
-…it was supposed to be a joke.
-Get me down, Kuroki!

243
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,207
You two are scaring me.

244
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,501
-I'm gonna puke!
-Get lost!

245
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,671
Before I forget, Mabel,
thanks for last night.

246
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,924
It was an unforgettable night.

247
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:54,513
Your sweet voice still lingers in my ear.

248
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,976
I fell asleep before you.
Did you get enough sleep?

249
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,438
Hey! Don't bring that up
in front of the others.

250
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,690
My god, Wolf…

251
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,191
This is a token of my gratitude.

252
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,029
You already gave me one.

253
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,864
Sell off the other one.

254
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,951
Who knows, it might go up in value.

255
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,911
Guess I'll hold on to it for now.

256
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,833
-Whatever, Yous-- Orc face and I…
-I've been wondering.

257
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,002
-…we're much more than…
-Why do you call him "Wolf"?

258
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,713
-…a ring that can bind two people.
-And why do you call him "Kuroki"?

259
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,758
I go by both names in this world.

260
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,386
But my real name in my world
is Yousuke Shibazaki.

261
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,639
-Shiba…
-Yousu…

262
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,940
Wolfgunblood is way more badass.

263
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,318
I like Tenma Kuroki better too.

264
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:56,158
Right? They're totally badass!

265
00:17:56,241 --> 00:18:00,037
Those names belong to a warrior
I once faced in Japan Bahamal.

266
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,831
So you appreciate them, huh?
I've underestimated you two!

267
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,836
Why did you tell them your name so easily?

268
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,799
You! Dummy!

269
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,262
Oh, no. If this breaks,
we're in for trouble.

270
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,848
What will you do with it?

271
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,559
I noticed this earlier.

272
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:28,023
The moment we slayed the blaze dragon,
two powerful energy bodies collided,

273
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,484
creating a rift in time-space.

274
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,322
Meaning, if I revive this dragon
so that it becomes more powerful

275
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,616
and strike it
with an even stronger attack,

276
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:41,453
I may be able to create a rift so large,
I'd be able to pass through to return--

277
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,789
What's your problem?

278
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,291
I'm going to smash it!

279
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,387
-<i>Elf?</i>
-<i>Tsundere.</i>

280
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,348
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>
<i>Just say you don't want him to leave.</i>

281
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,976
-<i>For God's sake, stop!</i>
-And so,

282
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,313
I finally found a kind of clue
to get back to this world.

283
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,526
So you actually raised that blaze dragon
until it grew so strong,

284
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,696
that you formed a rift large enough for
you to pass through and came back here?

285
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,115
-Yeah, I--
-Hold it!

286
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,244
There's a correct sequence of events.
A lousy retelling won't do.

287
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:26,081
It's going to take him another 14 years!
That's way too long!

288
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,416
Don't worry about that.

289
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:30,294
Solo play is my style.

290
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,713
I don't have many exciting stories left.

291
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,884
Are you sure?

292
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:41,138
There's a discrepancy between reality
and his perception of events.

293
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,023
I'm hungry. Are you?

294
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:54,943
Wanna go eat some ramen again?
I'll cover your tab.

295
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,778
-You will?
-Are you sure, Uncle?

296
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,905
No take-backs.

297
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,281
Hooray!

298
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,787
There's a nice breeze today.

299
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,999
We won't have to ask
the Ice spirit to chill our room.

300
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,710
Setting up fish head offerings
is a pain in the ass too.

301
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,342
SO GOOD!

302
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,056
What if there was an alien invasion
right now?

303
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,433
Fujimiya, what would you do?

304
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,393
I'll set you and your magic on them!

305
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,816
<i>A lot had happened this year.</i>

306
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,527
{\an8}POPS IS RED IN THE FACE

307
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,583
<i>We became live streamers…</i>

308
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,674
<i>and reconnected with a familiar face.</i>

309
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,599
<i>I've gotten used to my life with Uncle.</i>

310
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:13,355
<i>The anxiety I felt on the first day</i>
<i>has disappeared like a dream.</i>

311
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:25,575
But Uncle, your parallel-world life
was going steady.

312
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,160
Yeah, do you think so?

313
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:33,083
You made friends,
and you really hit it off with Elf.

314
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,546
The spirit of memory just…

315
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,468
Uncle!

316
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,805
Uncle, you won't believe what's happening!

317
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,560
Oh, on that day,

318
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,689
they took all my money
and threw me in the dungeon.

319
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,899
Why?

320

<i>My new life with my uncle</i>
