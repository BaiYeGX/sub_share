1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,378
HOTEL

2
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,025
Hey.

3
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,530
How long have you been watching?
I locked the door!

4
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:33,491
It's high time you give back my jacket.

5
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:38,163
You gave it to me, so it's mine.
I don't intend to give it back, ever.

6
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,125
What a greedy little rat.
You leave me no choice.

7
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,626
<i>Regsuuld stagga.</i>

8
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,631
Don't move.

9
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:52,927
What--

10
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,766
I can't believe
I have to pry it off of you.

11
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:01,978
Damn it. My magic is in the way.

12
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,565
Why not release me for a second?

13
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,941
Great idea.

14
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,028
Released.

15
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:18,453
You are so easy to trick!
You brainless idiot, you trusting fool--

16
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:34,886
-Isn't she horrible?
-Yeah.

17
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,889
<i>Why won't he let her have the jacket?</i>

18
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,518
And she's a thief too.

19
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,144
Her greed is bottomless.

20
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:47,816
She kept my jacket,
but she gave me this in exchange.

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,277
But what am I supposed to do
with such a skimpy outfit?

22
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,239
Well, do you know any woman who'd like it?

23
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,288
Why do I have to wear
such a revealing dress?

24
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,541
It looks great on you.

25
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,543
Does it?

26
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,797
Elf wore many dresses in this style.
Sure reminds me of her.

27
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,012
I can't believe
I'm actually missing the other world.

28
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,015
It looks like it costs a fortune.

29
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,475
Does it?

30
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,937
-<i>Then I want to try it on.</i>
-<i>Why?</i>

31
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,231
{\an8}UNCLE:
YOU'RE FINE THE WAY YOU ARE

32
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,139
GET HOME

33
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,395
SOLD CHEAPER THAN A SCOURING PAD

34
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,113
After thorough consideration,

35
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:02,992
the translation ability I acquired
after arriving in Another World

36
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,078
will hereby be known as

37
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,080
{\an8}Wild Talker!

38
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,164
{\an8}ALMIGHTY TALKER

39
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,041
{\an8}Thank you for the suggestion, Takafumi.

40
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,293
{\an8}-Yay.
-Nice going.

41
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,878
{\an8}MULTILINGUAL

42
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,713
<i>At least, we were able to veto his idea.</i>

43
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:18,258
<i>For some reason, I detest his idea.</i>

44
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,428
But what triggers Wild Talker?

45
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,723
This isn't good.

46
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,812
Sorry, I have a few things
to do on campus today.

47
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,981
You have a lecture on a Saturday?

48
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,400
It's more of an errand.

49
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,238
See you.

50
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,455
Look closely. Approach the enemy like so.

51
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,541
See that?

52
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,004
Lure the monster into the pit,
and it dies quickly.

53
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,380
Right.

54
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,091
By the way, Uncle. What's this?

55
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,885
Don't you know SEGA GENESIS?

56
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,972
I bought it
with the ad revenue we've made.

57
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,308
Really.

58
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:14,022
These are the games
that saved me in Another World.

59
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,523
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

60
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,944
A village was about to get pillaged
by a goblin horde.

61
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,238
I joined another group of adventurers

62
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,782
to deal justice to the vile creatures.

63
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,037
How is this a team up?

64
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,665
Hold on, let me fast-forward it.

65
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,585
Don't come near me.

66
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,920
Damn you, mutated goblin!

67
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,130
Alicia, run!

68
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,593
-I'm not a goblin.
-What?

69
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,555
I'm not an orc.

70
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,516
I remember you
from the overwinter thanksgiving festival.

71
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,770
Right, you surrounded me
as soon as I entered the village.

72
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,480
-I'm not an orc.
<i>-Were you there then?</i>

73
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,024
<i>-Yes, though we lost pretty badly.</i>
-But your face…

74
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,320
{\an8}SWORDSMAN, EDGAR - HOLY MAGE,
ALICIA - FIGHTER, RAIGA

75
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,532
Team up with him? Hell no,
he obviously sides with the goblins.

76
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:10,703
Right. He may not be an orc,
but he's closer to a monster than a man.

77
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,121
Excuse us.

78
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,666
We were assigned a mission to save
Dordo Village from a horde of goblins.

79
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,794
Can you lend us a hand? We'll reward you--

80
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,962
-I accept.
-What?

81
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,047
-What?
-What?

82
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,673
Oh, so you will!

83
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,634
Shouldn't we hurry?

84
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,053
<i>Yes!</i>

85
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,146
There's an army of them.

86
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,440
This isn't what we signed up for.

87
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,110
Don't worry.
I've won fights like this many times.

88
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,488
I have an idea. Leave this to me.

89
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,244
Hey, come at me!

90
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,163
Come on! Bring it!

91
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,711
Uncle.

92
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,840
Keep watching. My plan to push them
off the cliff failed for some reason…

93
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,924
For some reason?

94
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,719
In <i>Golden Axe</i>, there's a powerful move
called the Death Stab which can be dealt

95
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,139
by a dash, jump and attack combo.

96
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,641
<i>It's a hard move to land.</i>

97
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,150
-What a leap!
-Is that wind magic?

98
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,074
You missed every single time.

99
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,910
Like I said, it's a hard move to land.

100
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,801
<i>By using a move inspired from</i> Golden Axe<i>,</i>

101
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,762
<i>I eliminated an entire horde of goblins.</i>

102
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,264
That's nonsense!

103
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,309
<i>Golden Axe</i> had nothing to do
with your victory.

104
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,227
If anything, it screwed up the battle.

105
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,939
Takafumi, as you can see,

106
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,776
SEGA games are very helpful in life!

107
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,197
Stop dragging SEGA into this,
you'll cause them problems!

108
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,743
<i>After we won, we headed to the village</i>
<i>to collect our reward.</i>

109
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,870
You aren't half bad!

110
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,164
Are you sure
you only want a fourth of the prize money?

111
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:23,503
Yes. I'd hate to get ambushed again
for being greedy.

112
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,005
Edgar laughed!

113
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,884
<i>Uncle, you made friends!</i>

114
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,931
<i>Sorry to bring this up.</i>

115
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:40,144
But you restructured the barrier
protecting the Sealed City Luvaldram.

116
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,568
So you saw me.

117
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,905
Have you told anyone?

118
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,824
No one would believe me even if I did.

119
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,662
I won't lie
that your appearance strikes fear,

120
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,541
-but you are like the legendary hero--
-<i>Icuras cuora.</i>

121
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,419
What? Why?

122
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,297
-We trusted you!
<i>-Icuras cuora.</i>

123
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,472
Was this the last you saw of them?

124
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,182
No, I ran into them again.

125
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,185
Looking back on it,
on our third encounter,

126
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,313
I was suddenly able to
communicate with a beast.

127
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,815
Really, with a beast?

128
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:30,486
It could be
that something activated Wild Talker.

129
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,031
<i>Divine power, aid my friends!</i>

130
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,283
<i>They aren't beasts!</i>

131
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,451
<i>Don't hold back!</i>

132
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,245
<i>Damn, his shield is too powerful!</i>

133
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,207
-Didn't we just see this?
-Not there. Fast forwarding.

134
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,002
<i>I remember you.</i>

135
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,006
<i>The entire village surrounded you</i>
<i>during the thanksgiving festival,</i>

136
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,216
<i>but we were defeated.</i>

137
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,176
<i>That's right. I'm not an orc.</i>

138
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,721
<i>Is this deja vu?</i>

139
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,599
<i>It's the same conversation</i>
<i>because their memories were erased.</i>

140
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,851
I'm Raiga.

141
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:04,103
-And I'm Alicia.
-Edgar here.

142
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,063
I am Tenma Kuroki.

143
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,315
<i>Good to meet you all.</i>

144
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,525
<i>-Another cringey pseudonym?</i>
<i>-Kuroki?</i>

145
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,776
<i>So what are you doing here?</i>

146
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:14,989
A beast has built a nest
inside the ancient shrine.

147
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:19,619
We're on a quest to slay it,
but it's too ferocious.

148
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,495
What kind of beast is it?

149
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:25,291
It's a deadly quilled beast.
Have you heard of hedgehogs?

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,003
It's a human-sized version of that.

151
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,796
That sounds awfully like Sonic--

152
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,634
It curls up into a spiky ball,
and we can't kill it.

153
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:36,218
Don't kill it!

154
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,303
What?

155
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,681
Why does it fight in the first place?

156
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,225
Find out why it's aggressive,

157
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,270
and you may even
be able to avoid the fight!

158
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,230
Find out why?

159
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,525
Dimwit. It already wreaked havoc,
we don't have any other choice.

160
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,486
There it is!

161
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,945
Sonic!

162
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:04,580
What are you?

163
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:10,211
As you can see, hedgehogs in Another World
look nothing like ours.

164
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,213
They aren't blue, and they are slow.

165
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,214
What?

166
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,215
HEDGEHOG

167
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,008
I'm not sure about that.

168
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,719
And then I began speaking with it.

169
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,599
Beast, why do you prey on humans?

170
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,310
Did they drive you out of your habitat?

171
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,063
Or did they trespass on your territory?

172
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,857
Perhaps you only want
to protect your young.

173
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,193
Did humans kill your family?

174
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,319
Tell me!

175
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,323
I, I don't want to kill you!

176
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,661
-I can understand it.
-What?

177
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,331
I can understand its language!

178
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,376
{\an8}HUMAN MEAT IS DISGUSTING.

179
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,920
{\an8}Then why kill them?

180
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,589
{\an8}I ENJOY INFLICTING PAIN
WITH MY NEEDLES.

181
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,508
Right.

182
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,553
{\an8}THEIR DYING SCREAMS ARE MUSIC
TO MY EARS.

183
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,973
{\an8}I TOYED WITH THEM AS THEY DIED.

184
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,392
<i>Baraibhut folg bastohl.</i>

185
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,284
There you have it, we communicated.

186
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,703
Perhaps Wild Talker activates

187
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,790
when I am genuinely interested
in understanding someone.

188
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:32,168
Right.

189
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,462
<i>Uncle is ruthless</i>
<i>when he's forced to engage.</i>

190
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,923
Wow, this is unbelievable.

191
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,342
So what was the beast saying?

192
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:45,514
Enough about that.
I heard there's a hero near here.

193
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,224
<i>Have you heard anything?</i>

194
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,018
<i>A hero?</i>

195
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,687
<i>Elf mentioned something about a hero</i>
<i>the other day too.</i>

196
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,440
MIFUYU FUJIMIYA - CELL PHONE

197
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:58,235
Fujimiya forgot her phone.
I'll go find her.

198
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,404
Can't it wait till tomorrow?

199
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:05,242
Going out without a phone is like
playing video games without a controller.

200
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,911
That's terrible! Let's go!

201
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,962
Flying feels nice, Uncle!

202
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,047
It sure does.

203
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,258
But the wind stings in the winter.
We'll take the train then.

204
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:27,598
Let's see. She should be around here.

205
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,147
There she is.

206
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,942
{\an8}PHOENIX FIRE ANNIHILATION

207
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:46,909
Takafumi, I'm just going to watch.
You go deal with it.

208
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,035
I know.

209
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,541
I'll go see if he's all right.
She's my friend, after all.

210
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,834
A friend, huh?

211
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,755
-Let me down where no one can see.
-Wait.

212
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:03,759
Let's ask the spirits for a little help.

213
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:08,347
Hello, spirits!
Thanks for all of your help!

214
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,893
I'm Shibazaki. I run the YouTube channel,
Uncle from Another World.

215
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:18,023
Now, you'll be able to cast
the same spells that I can.

216
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,441
At least for the next hour.

217
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,277
Wow! Thanks, Uncle!

218
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:27,157
Takafumi, what if that man
is a decent fellow?

219
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:31,704
If he is, then I'll leave things to her.

220
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,290
-I see.
-If he's scum, I'll obliterate him.

221
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,624
-What?
-His memory, I mean.

222
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,334
Oh, sure.

223
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:42,548
Let's go spend a night at the beach!

224
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,341
No, thanks.

225
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,636
Why not? Remember the trip
to the hot springs last year?

226
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,263
I'm busy.

227
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,349
-You kept me up all night on that trip.
-Fujimiya.

228
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,274
Why are you here?

229
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,067
Who's this guy?

230
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,570
You forgot your phone.

231
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,322
Oh, thanks.

232
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,286
-What's your problem?
-Chiaki?

233
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,334
-Who--
-It's me, Takafumi. Don't you remember me?

234
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,636
Ta…

235
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,347
Takafumi, is that you, bro?

236
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,308
-Yeah.
-How long has it been?

237
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,770
<i>You've grown a ton.</i>
<i>I didn't recognize you at all!</i>

238
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,857
<i>I hit a growth spurt in high school.</i>
<i>You've grown too, Chiaki.</i>

239
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,318
-Are you in fourth grade now?
-Yep!

240
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,947
I'm here to shoot a YouTube video
with my sister!

241
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,616
-Hi, Uncle.
-You have a YouTube channel?

242
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,035
-Holy crap. Is he your younger brother?
-Yeah! I even hit 50 views!

243
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:56,789
I hear kids nowadays hit puberty early,
but he's as tall as any adult.

244
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,166
I know. Chiaki!

245
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,420
He's the YouTuber I told you about.

246
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,714
No way!

247
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:17,017
Hello, kid! I'm Uncle
from Another World's Uncle!

248
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,144
Never heard of your channel.

249
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,232
Do you live-stream games?

250
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,441
Well, yes.

251
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,319
I've streamed <i>Guardian Heroes</i>
on SEGA SATURN the other day.

252
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,446
What? Never heard of it.

253
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,743
Is that a popular game YouTubers stream?

254
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,953
Actually, yes.

255
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,872
Plenty of YouTubers play it.

256
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:44,461
-You looked tense at first.
-Another channel's mentioned mine too.

257
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,506
I didn't recognize Chiaki from afar.

258
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,718
I thought maybe he was your boyfriend.

259
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,470
What? I don't have a boyfriend!

260
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,182
It'd be no surprise if you did.
You are very pretty.

261
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,898
You were gearing up for a fight
as if he was flirting.

262
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:10,237
I thought he was toying with you.

263
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,864
I lost my temper.

264
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,366
Yeah, as if.

265
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,079
What would you have done if he was scum?

266
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,331
Well, you know--

267
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,292
Spirit of light--

268
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,046
No, let's try something different.

269
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,797
Optic camouflage.

270
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,343
Wow, I'm invisible!

271
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,928
Project illusions.

272
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,435
Are these holograms?

273
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,021
Casting instant teleport.

274
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,817
I swear, look it up.

275
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:01,288
Uncle let me borrow his spells.

276
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,457
I wasn't too worried about fighting.

277
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,667
I didn't know magic
could be lent out like this.

278
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,463
-You got the hang of it fast.
-Yeah.

279
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:15,302
I've thought through how I'd fight enemies
with magic in our world.

280
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:18,055
Magic's biggest weakness
is it takes too long to recite spells.

281
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,642
It's no good if you get shot
before you finish casting a spell.

282
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:25,354
I thought it'd be possible to use
simple spells

283
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,233
without saying "spirit of wind"
or "spirit of water"

284
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,319
if I spoke a short phrase instead.

285
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:35,072
Looks like I was on the right track.

286
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,198
I couldn't care less.

287
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,575
Don't get used to magic.

288
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,161
It can bite you in the ass one day.

289
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,539
We don't live in a storybook.

290
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,878
Didn't something like this happen
when we were in grade school?

291
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,004
Yeah?

292
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:55,217
You intervened when I was
getting picked on by older kids.

293
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,677
I remember now.

294
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,054
You got shoved.

295
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,849
No, that didn't happen.

296
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:03,642
Did I get it wrong?

297
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,812
Let's just watch it.

298
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,857
Memory playback.

299
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,404
<i>This is the sixth graders' area.</i>

300
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:20,325
Why don't you act your age then?

301
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,538
With all your whining,
you sound like the brat here.

302
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,124
Shut your trap, ugly!

303
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,919
Ouch! That really hurt!

304
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,338
Moriyan, are you okay?

305
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,801
Did you get an owie? Next hit.

306
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,098
Are you hurt, Sumika?

307
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,558
Takafumi.

308
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,060
You guys are so mean! Don't push a girl!

309
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,607
They pushed you, right?

310
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,025
Are you in pain?

311
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,819
No, I'm okay.

312
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,864
Your face is red.

313
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,699
<i>I'm fine, really.</i>

314
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,867
<i>I can carry you.</i>

315
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,870
Was I the perpetrator?

316
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,539
I had completely misunderstood
the situation.

317
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,583
Guess so.

318
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,341
{\an8}But…

319
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,931
{\an8}you really made me smile.

320
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:28,310
{\an8}You always come to my aid, then and now.

321
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,108
{\an8}Fujimii!

322
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,780
{\an8}Sawa!

323
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,950
{\an8}What? Who is he?

324
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,705
{\an8}Good to meet you.

325
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:52,334
{\an8}I'm her longtime friend, Takafumi Takaoka.

326
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,795
{\an8}Takafumi, good to meet you.

327
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,297
{\an8}I'm Sawae.
We've been friends since high school.

328
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,591
{\an8}I go by Sawa though.

329
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,218
{\an8}<i>Wow.</i>

330
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,178
{\an8}You know,

331
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,890
{\an8}Fujimii's grown much cuter
in the last six months.

332
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,270
{\an8}A lot of guys want to get with her.

333
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:16,984
{\an8}Who are they?
I know, just give me their numbers.

334
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,528
{\an8}Tell me all their names. Don't be shy.

335
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,905
{\an8}That's quite sudden.

336
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:26,118
{\an8}Stop it! What are you going to do
with their numbers?

337
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,789
{\an8}I won't do a thing.

338
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:34,459
{\an8}After all, if they can't remember,
it's not like I'm hurting them.

339
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,297
{\an8}You're on a real power trip, aren't you?

340
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,092
{\an8}Well, male college students
are less like people,

341
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,928
and more like insects
that need to be crushed.

342
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,806
They'll try to take Fujimiya home
after the freshmen welcoming party.

343
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,017
-Then they'll take videos and leak them--
-Don't get unhinged

344
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,310
with your twisted Internet ideas!

345
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,186
CHIAKI

346
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,398
Oh, no. I left Chiaki.

347
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,567
Sorry, Sawa.
I have to take my brother home!

348
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,111
Sure. See you later.

349
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,407
What's with him?

350
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,242
I hope Fujimii's safe with him.

351
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,621
I took Chiaki home.

352
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:15,709
Did you two figure out
what triggers Wild Talker?

353
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,837
Apparently, it's direct communication
while under immense pressure.

354
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,674
Up till now, the skill has only been
activated when Uncle was desperate.

355
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:27,804
What about when you spoke with a spirit
when you first woke up from your coma?

356
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,889
Oh, that.

357
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,643
<i>Takafumi held the welfare paperwork,</i>
<i>and I felt my life was over.</i>

358
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,275
I was desperate. I thought if I didn't
impress him with magic, he'd leave me.

359
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,238
You were ready to jump ship too.

360
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,742
Anyway, about the hero. Right, Uncle?

361
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,578
That's right.
We were in the middle of the playback.

362
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:54,081
What? Did you find the hero?

363
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,249
Not yet, but she's close by.

364
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,584
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

365
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,254
Alicia and her friends know
about the hero.

366
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:06,009
This is their third encounter, but Uncle
erased their memories from last time.

367
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:11,181
Enough about that.
I heard there's a hero near here.

368
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,432
Have you heard anything?

369
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:14,893
About that.

370
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,897
Edgar, lend me your sword.

371
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,357
Why?

372
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,566
<i>Just let me have it.</i>

373
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,828
I am the destined hero, the…

374
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,750
Alicia Edelcia, a divine hero.

375
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,919
