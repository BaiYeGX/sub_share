1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:05,213
Seriously? Three bronze coins?

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,883
This ain't enough pay
for all the hauling we did!

3
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:17,058
What am I supposed to do
with a half-dead orc?

4
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,769
<i>Wait until you hear him talk!</i>

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,771
<i>Plenty of other shops might want him.</i>

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,981
Damn him.

7
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:26,526
I found a scouring pad along the way.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,862
How much can you give us for this?

9
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,406
<i>A filthy piece of trash.</i>

10
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,373
<i>120 bronze pieces.</i>

11
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,836
<i>Two whole figures more!</i>

12
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,547
<i>Uncle is dirt-cheap!</i>

13
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,261
{\an8}UNCLE:
YOU'RE FINE THE WAY YOU ARE

14
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,169
GET HOME

15
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,425
SOLD CHEAPER THAN A SCOURING PAD

16
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,811
I'm worth less than a scouring pad?

17
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,063
How do you not know that, Uncle?

18
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,614
Why do you two have nosebleeds?

19
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,163
I know.
I must have used the memory erase spell.

20
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,749
My memories flooded back just now.

21
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,876
Mine too.

22
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,753
<i>I recalled reading the page about this</i>

23
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,381
right now.

24
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:02,724
Fujimiya,
read the first page of my notebook.

25
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,435
What a tattered notebook.

26
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,896
Don't read past the first page!

27
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,444
"Sold cheaper than a scouring pad."

28
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:20,158
I got rid of this tragic memory
once I learned the memory erase spell.

29
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:24,245
This must've been quite a shock,
even for you, Uncle.

30
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:28,958
When there's a reminder,
erased memories can come back.

31
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,337
The nosebleed is a sign of warning

32
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,673
by the spirit of memory
that you're about to have a flashback.

33
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:39,010
But we watched the actual event,
so what can we do?

34
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,430
<i>Isn't there a better way</i>
<i>to heed a warning?</i>

35
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,390
<i>Are you all good?</i>

36
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,892
<i>I've had enough.</i>

37
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,352
<i>My shoulders are sore.</i>

38
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,688
<i>So what becomes of Uncle?</i>

39
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,969
<i>So they threw me into the basement</i>
<i>of a freak show.</i>

40
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,846
I'm skipping a week.

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,598
Why's that?

42
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,811
<i>The shopkeeper completely forgot about me.</i>

43
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,277
Without the puddle from the rain
on the third day, I would've been dead.

44
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:42,573
A single ray of light
cuts through darkness.

45
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:45,034
Just like Voltteccer.

46
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,536
Bet you didn't know this.

47
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,330
There's a game on Mega Drive
called <i>Pulseman.</i>

48
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,667
His ultimate move is supposed to be
pronounced with strength.

49
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,377
It's pronounced "Voltteccer"!

50
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,755
<i>When bouncing off walls, he can</i>
<i>stay in his Voltteccer state indefinitely.</i>

51
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,341
<i>It's a powerful and beautiful move.</i>

52
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,137
<i>You can't talk about </i>Pulseman<i> and</i>
<i>not mention the semi-transparent levels.</i>

53
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,054
He's lost it.

54
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,764
<i>A beautiful expression</i>
<i>of the electricity world.</i>

55
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,934
-Look at what Uncle's become.
-No, you got it wrong.

56
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,813
<i>I was speaking to the ray of moonlight</i>
<i>to try to remain sane.</i>

57
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,690
<i>Can't you tell from the look on my face?</i>

58
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,942
I knew what I was doing.

59
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:21,362
Talk about being ahead of its time.
The team that developed Pulseman…

60
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,447
I-I can see that.

61
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,198
…hit a jackpot with a game called <i>Pokemon</i>.

62
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,575
You're right.

63
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:30,913
But I know that someday, they'll release
<i>Pulseman 2</i> on a SEGA console.

64
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,168
Pulseman becomes invincible
while in Voltteccer mode.

65
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,588
It's just the coolest move ever.

66
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:43,801
He shines beautifully,
like this ray of moonlight.

67
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,678
An invincible body.

68
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,640
What? You're thanking me?

69
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,768
I'm not just saying it.

70
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,145
I don't grovel, you know.

71
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,398
You are the most beautiful thing
I've seen in this world.

72
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,780
Who's there?

73
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,243
Could this ray of light be sentient?

74
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,707
You are the spirit of light, Kilighd.

75
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,044
Chant…

76
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,880
the ancient words?

77
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:27,220
<i>Kilighd l'gid riolran.</i>

78
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,271
A sword of light.

79
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:40,024
That was the very first magic I used.

80
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,859
I got out thanks to this spell.

81
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:49,659
Uncle, don't tell me
you were muttering at--

82
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,245
Yes, that was the spirit of light.

83
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,581
There are others like the spirit of wind
and fire and whatnot.

84
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,417
How did you suddenly gain the ability
to converse with spirits?

85
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,963
-Is this his translation ability?
-Yes.

86
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:06,884
Was Uncle using the translation ability
given by the gods?

87
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,762
Yes,

88
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,391
that must be the secret behind
Uncle's exceptional magical talent.

89
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,644
<i>Even back in the Shielded City,</i>

90
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,648
<i>Uncle was the only one</i>
<i>who could communicate with the spirits!</i>

91
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,236
So that's what it was.

92
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:30,032
I was wondering why my take on magic
differed from others'.

93
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:37,331
Had I communicated with the residents,
I could've known this while I was there.

94
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,625
Actually,

95
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:44,172
how did you explain your sudden
magic and language acquisition?

96
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,009
Well, you know,

97
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,263
I can pick up video games
even when I have no idea

98
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,765
what the in-game English means.

99
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:59,729
I thought my adaptability
honed from video games was at work.

100
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,981
You don't have that kind of talent.

101
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,067
His trust in video games
never fails to amuse.

102
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,987
<i>So then what happened?</i>

103
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,071
<i>Oh, right.</i>

104
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,783
<i>I used the Sword of Light</i>
<i>and escaped the cell.</i>

105
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,459
<i>I also freed the little creatures</i>
<i>in captivity on my way out.</i>

106
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,217
How cute!

107
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,011
They liked you! Did you keep them as pets?

108
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,722
<i>Well, no.</i>

109
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,684
<i>One of them nipped my carotid artery.</i>

110
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,144
Ferocious monsters!

111
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,991
Help me!

112
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,910
What in the world is happening?

113
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,704
Malicious rodents, death beasts,
and crazed-fanged fowls!

114
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,416
Monsters from across the Eastern continent
have broken free!

115
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,212
Someone help!

116
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,686
<i>W-Will I</i>

117
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,648
<i>live as an ordinary commoner</i>

118
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,901
<i>who runs for his life?</i>

119
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,737
<i>Or, will I…</i>

120
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,578
<i>Regsuuid zaldohna!</i>

121
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,672
Thank you so much. You saved me--

122
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,384
You've done well.

123
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,098
You are safe now, rest assured.

124
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,058
Transfer the injured, Spirit.

125
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,310
Destination set.

126
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,873
<i>So I fought throughout the night.</i>

127
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,963
<i>The battle finally ended at last.</i>

128
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,802
<i>Baraib garl.</i>

129
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:55,655
<i>Many thanks to the monsters</i>
<i>that nourished my starved body.</i>

130
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,743
How do I say this,

131
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,456
though my 17 years in Another World
was nothing but hardship

132
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:10,127
as you saw, at least I had a great start.

133
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,712
<i>Is he being serious?</i>

134
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,131
<i>How is this a great start?</i>

135
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,136
Had I been appraised for more than
a scouring pad, I'd have no complaints.

136
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,768
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,187
It's late, I have to get going.

138
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,148
I can't miss out on fried chicken.

139
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,692
Let's watch the rest on another day.

140
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,486
Good idea.

141
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:38,823
It only went downhill from here anyway.

142
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,576
Things got even worse?

143
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,663
What do you mean? What happened?

144
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,624
Nothing, really.

145
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,044
I saved Elf from a dragon.

146
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,466
She thanked me by berating me.
What a pain.

147
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,218
This part is crucial!

148
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,470
This is the part I came for!

149
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:08,102
<i>Start dinner without me. Okay.</i>

150
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:12,565
Now, show me some action worth giving up
my fried chicken for, Uncle!

151
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,650
All right, watch closely.

152
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:18,904
The battle against a Venom Dragon happened
on my 9th day in Another World.

153
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,407
It went like this.

154
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,205
Ta-da, I won.

155
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,124
The fight ended!

156
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,710
My fried chicken.

157
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:36,005
Your magic is unmatched!
You struck down a dragon in one go!

158
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,718
I couldn't have slayed it that easily
under normal conditions.

159
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,178
But see,

160
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,516
Elf had already dealt repeated blows
on this part of its body.

161
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,019
So I went for this vulnerable spot.

162
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,190
She almost got the whole thing by herself.

163
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,742
An orc.

164
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,251
I didn't see anything.

165
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,712
Also, I'm not an orc.

166
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,590
Are you covered?

167
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,968
Do you know how to zip it up?

168
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,436
I owe you my gratitude, swordsman.

169
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:38,025
Anyone else would've done the same.

170
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,034
What a monstrosity.

171
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:51,038
You must be an evil orc.

172
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:52,581
How ugly.

173
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,960
Your ugliness is unforgivable.

174
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,753
She glitched.

175
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,714
She became unhinged.

176
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,883
Where'd you get that knife?

177
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,427
W-What am I doing?

178
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,555
Pardon me.

179
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,515
You stabbed yourself!

180
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,808
Are you hurt?

181
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,818
H-Hey!

182
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:21,902
<i>What are you doing?</i>

183
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,612
<i>Where's the wound?</i>
<i>We have to stop the bleeding!</i>

184
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,407
<i>I didn't get stabbed! I'm unharmed!</i>

185
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,744
There's not a single cut.

186
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,580
Your skin is very smooth.

187
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,582
Maybe the cut is somewhere else.

188
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,625
What about here? Or here?

189
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,628
Hey!

190
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,090
You'll pay for this!

191
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,386
My eyes will never forget your swine face!

192
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,764
I'll make sure we're even someday!

193
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,058
Are you sure you aren't hurt?

194
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:56,103
Don't come any closer, you pervert orc!

195
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,438
Pig, you are a pig!

196
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,607
You pig, you ugly orc!

197
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,195
Uncle, say something.

198
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,076
No. Talking back in this situation
would only provoke her.

199
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,661
Patience is key.

200
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,498
<i>What kind of student life did Uncle have?</i>

201
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,501
<i>And this is when</i>

202
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,213
<i>her pestering started.</i>

203
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,302
She stole my jacket and said
terrible things to me whenever I saw her.

204
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,347
She didn't help me
when I got frozen in ice, too.

205
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,556
Elf, that jerk.

206
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,309
Speaking of getting frozen in ice.

207
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,062
<i>What happened after that night?</i>

208
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,232
Let me show you.

209
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,694
My body feels heavy.

210
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,322
Is this the aftermath
of getting stuck in ice?

211
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,619
What is this soft thing on my body?

212
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,386
What are you doing in my room?

213
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,640
Some tribes in the North
use their preys' organs to stay warm.

214
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,601
It's chilly, so I was warming up!

215
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:18,727
<i>That's a stretch.</i>

216
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,854
<i>What a terrible excuse.</i>

217
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,273
<i>That makes sense.</i>

218
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,900
-<i>He believed her!</i>
-<i>I don't believe this!</i>

219
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,486
Yes, it's a bit chilly tonight.

220
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,489
Let's sleep in so we don't catch a cold.

221
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,742
It's cold, so I'll warm up with your body.

222
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,579
Using me like an organ from a hunt.

223
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,042
Do as you please.

224
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,258
What's with you?

225
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,638
Mother.

226
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,557
Mother.

227
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,308
No.

228
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,728
Mother.

229
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,355
Mother.

230
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,235
Are you--

231
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,280
I don't want to work!

232
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,365
You told me, Mother.

233
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,284
"Life is a piece of cake."

234
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:19,997
I'd never go hungry
as long as I have the god-freezing sword.

235
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,876
I don't want to work, Mother.

236
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,964
Mother, you left with a younger man
when I was nine.

237
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,556
Why'd you hit me?

238
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:41,435
I couldn't bear to watch you complain
about wanting to be a bum.

239
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,188
I'm kidding.

240
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,483
I, Mabel, want to find work!

241
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,278
It's noble to work!

242
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,946
Your body says otherwise!

243
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,618
Like I said, sell that ring
and you don't have to earn a living.

244
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,496
He's right, sell it off already.

245
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,209
But I should be able to support myself.

246
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,503
Working is for cattle.

247
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,881
I don't understand how pawning works.

248
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,633
I'll pitch a high price for you.

249
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:20,599
This is my last resort,
I'll save it until I'm out of options.

250
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,061
Oh, I see, okay.

251
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,273
What if you were under Elf's care for now?

252
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,358
What?

253
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,485
You have money left over
from selling your ring.

254
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:35,072
I deposited the money at the bank, but--

255
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:39,118
Be my master!

256
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,205
-Master!
-What?

257
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,210
I-It's nothing.

258
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,921
Don't say that
if you're going to be ashamed about it.

259
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,217
Anyway, let's grab breakfast.

260
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,344
I'll treat you two today.

261
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,138
Bark!

262
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,272
I haven't introduced myself yet.

263
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,441
I am Mabel Rayveil.

264
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:16,196
I'm the last of the Ice clan,
and my dream is to become an explorer.

265
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,990
Great to meet you two.

266
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,616
I am--

267
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,327
No, Elf will do.

268
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,998
I'm the only one of my kind
outside the kingdom's borders anyway.

269
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,294
My mission is to find and gather
the scattered ancient relics.

270
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,171
Good to be with both of you.

271
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,423
I am Wolfgunblood.

272
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,176
-<i>Liar!</i>
-<i>He went for a fancy name!</i>

273
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,221
<i>I'm traveling to find the way back</i>
<i>to my home country.</i>

274
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,347
<i>Good to be with you both.</i>

275
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,641
Why'd you choose an alias?

276
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,896
Don't tell your real name
to a bunch of strangers.

277
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,648
<i>He's known Elf</i>
<i>for at least three years by this point.</i>

278
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,984
<i>He's well-versed</i>
<i>in parallel world customs.</i>

279
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,071
I am departing for Ikoza City now.

280
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:01,700
Ikoza?
Isn't that where you sold your ring off?

281
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,745
I don't recall
there being dungeons in that area.

282
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,373
S-Shut it! Let me do as I please!

283
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,917
Dummy! Womanizer orc!

284
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,544
<i>She wants to go buy her ring back.</i>

285
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,297
<i>She feels threatened</i>
<i>by Mabel's appearance.</i>

286
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,466
Wolfgunblood.

287
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,675
Where is he?

288
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,387
Wait, that's me.

289
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,098
What will you be doing today?

290
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,352
A hero is trying to clear
a dungeon nearby.

291
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,312
I'll go scout it out.

292
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,856
A hero of legendary strength.

293
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,985
That title was vacant for 50 years
until her appointment.

294
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:41,406
I heard she single-handedly slayed

295
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:45,327
a horde of legion-class beasts,
earning her the title "Shining Crusader".

296
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,829
Is that what happened? That's amazing!

297
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,790
I will go with you, Wolf.

298
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,338
But I'm a night owl.
I'll take a nap until around 2:00 p.m.

299
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,925
So please stick around
until five o'clock or so.

300
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,432
<i>And that's a wrap for the day.</i>

301
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,726
<i>The party disbanded!</i>

302
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,813
<i>Mabel is a bum to the bone.</i>
<i>She can't join Uncle!</i>

303
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,609
Speaking of five o'clock,
look at the time.

304
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,987
Let's let Fujimiya get home.

305
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,950
I should've gone with fried chicken.

306
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,785
Are you starved?

307
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,832
Wanna go eat some ramen?
I'll cover your tab.

308
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,252
-You will?
-Are you sure, Uncle?

309
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,298
No take-backs.

310
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,055
<i>Generally speaking,</i>
<i>Uncle's life in Another World was hellish.</i>

311
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,685
<i>Though the gods of Another World</i>
<i>were quite shabby,</i>

312
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,937
<i>at least Tsundere Elf and Mabel</i>
<i>were with Uncle.</i>

313
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,649
<i>The bowl of ramen from my uncle</i>

314
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,235
<i>was very tasty.</i>

315
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,785
<i>He was a little short on money,</i>
<i>so Fujimiya spotted the rest.</i>

316
