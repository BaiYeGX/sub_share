{\an8}THE FAMILIAR OF ZERO VOL.14

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,011
Look what we have here.

3
00:00:11,928 --> 00:00:16,015
Takafumi brought a naughty book to school!

4
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,100
It's not naughty.

5
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,268
Let me see it!

6
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,354
-Stop it!
-Naughty, naughty!

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:24,107
Oh, no. Kacchan is picking on Takafumi.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,608
He's done for.

9
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,903
All the illustrations are of women.

10
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,321
I knew it was dirty.

11
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,698
-It's dirty.
-No, it's not.

12
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,867
-How naughty.
-It's just a fantasy light novel.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,244
"It's just a 'panda-sy tight' novel."

14
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,706
That was spot-on!

15
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,336
Give me the naughty book.

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,504
Ms. Fujimiya.

{\an8}BY NOBORU YAMAGUCHI

19
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,012
You call this explicit?

20
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,098
You aren't a toddler anymore.

21
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,893
-Run!
-Kacchan is finished.

22
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,854
I'm sorry, Ms. Fujimiya.

23
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:05,065
I'm sorry, Ms. Fujimiya.

24
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:11,029
Fujimiya, you are so impressive.

25
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:14,157
Right? That's my Fujimiya.

26
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,910
You scared Kacchan to death.

27
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,204
{\an8}UNCLE:
YOU'RE FINE THE WAY YOU ARE

28
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,112
GET HOME

29
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,368
SOLD CHEAPER THAN A SCOURING PAD

30
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,419
<i>That may be true.</i>

31
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,672
I might have been quite a brat
for the first few years of grade school.

32
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,134
But I became more girlie
by the time I hit middle school.

33
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,429
See?

34
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,643
Wow!

35
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,063
A picture of you and Takafumi.

36
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,108
-Let me take a picture of this.
-A picture?

37
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,568
{\an8}FUNCTION - PLAY - DISPLAY - ZOOM

38
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:20,074
If you want, I can send it to your phone.

39
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,620
-How?
-I can email it or something.

40
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,081
This phone doesn't have an in-box,
and it can't call.

41
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,541
What?

42
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,004
How do you communicate with Takafumi
without a working cell phone?

43
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:38,218
I'm wondering if we can use
smoke signals or flags.

44
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,346
Smoke is prohibited
in an apartment building.

45
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,389
Smoke signals and flags…

46
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,893
<i>I didn't realize that this apartment</i>
<i>was a medieval castle.</i>

47
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,897
-What?
-What?

48
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,358
Why is this coffee ridiculously delicious?

49
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,318
Can you tell?

50
00:03:55,401 --> 00:04:00,448
I got 10,000 yen for my 20th birthday, so
I bought a coffee mill and a bag of beans.

51
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:05,161
It's my first time tasting coffee brewed
from freshly-ground beans. So distinct.

52
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,373
Uncle gave you 10,000 yen in cash
as your birthday gift?

53
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,499
How practical.

54
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,376
I had to.

55
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:16,798
I have no clue
what youngsters want nowadays.

56
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,178
Well, any gift is welcome
if you put your heart into it.

57
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,638
Really?

58
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,600
What if I got a GAME GEAR TV tuner?

59
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,602
That's not a good gift.

61
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,064
{\an8}Seriously, I appreciate cash.

62
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,526
As there is still some money left,
I'll get more beans.

63
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,279
I'll get some sweets then.

64
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:43,283
<i>Birthday gift, huh?</i>

65
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,704
NEW MESSAGE

66
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,923
A GIFT

67
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,341
FROM MY MIDDLE SCHOOL DAYS

68
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,266
<i>How can I help you?</i>

69
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,518
How to delete pictures on social media.

70
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,312
Wait, why are you deleting it?

71
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,231
-<i>This is what I found online…</i>
-Seriously, it's risky.

72
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,900
-<i>…about deleting photos on social media.</i>
-What's risky about it?

73
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,570
You could get arrested
and become ostracized by society.

74
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,366
You can get arrested for this?
How frightening!

75
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,659
You can't.

76
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,370
Actually, I'm not sure.

77
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,456
Sorry, perhaps I was being hasty.

78
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,624
Also, please don't show it to your uncle.

THIS MONTH'S DEAL
ETHIOPIAN COFFEE BEANS

80
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,380
Coffee beans are on sale today.
I'm gonna go get a bag!

81
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,465
What?

82
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,105
Fujimiya.

83
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,317
Your swimsuit photo
that you bet your life on…

84
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:06,532
lost to the sales ad for coffee beans
in terms of content appeal.

85
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,829
No, no, no.

86
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,208
I was just a middle schooler.

87
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,085
If he were to see me now--

88
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,592
Freeze!

89
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,226
W-- What did you do?

90
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,686
I spilled my coffee! Did you get burned?

91
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,106
I can't use any healing spells.

92
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,025
I feel like I'm frostbitten instead.

93
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,527
Then…

94
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,904
Spirit of fire,

95
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,199
turn my enemy into cinder
with scorching hellfire--

96
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,243
Enough with the magic!

97
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,585
Please, feel free to take a shower.

98
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,219
<i>I sincerely apologize.</i>

99
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,889
<i>You might feel uncomfortable</i>
<i>showering while I'm here.</i>

100
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,933
<i>I'll be out for a couple of hours.</i>

101
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,894
<i>I'll leave Takafumi's clothes out for you.</i>

102
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,611
<i>All warm and cozy.</i>

103
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,532
<i>It's a men's shirt.</i>

104
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,869
<i>What if Takafumi's preference</i>
<i>is girls in boys' shirts?</i>

105
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,162
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

106
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:45,506
<i>Would he change his mind about me a bit</i>
<i>if he were to see me in the nude?</i>

107
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,759
-<i>It won't hurt to be seen.</i>
-Uncle?

108
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,386
Why's the curtain closed?

109
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,322
S-- Sorry.

110
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,334
S-- Seriously, I'm so sorry!

111
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,594
<i>I'll be out for a couple of hours.</i>

112
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,032
-Takafumi.
-I'm so sorry.

113
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,119
I'm trying to shut out that kind of stuff.

114
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,414
But you are so cute, I can't help myself.

115
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,835
You must be uncomfortable, being gazed at
in that way by a friend, right?

116
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,257
Sorry.

117
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,384
If you could look at me in that way,

118
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,971
actually, I'd be flattered.

119
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:33,489
Fujimiya,

120
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,534
you've been always so thoughtful.

121
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,580
-I'll take full responsibility.
-Responsibility?

122
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,831
What do you mean?

123
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,255
I placed the flag upside down.

124
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,381
The flag?

125
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,801
What?

126
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,054
Takafumi, are you in danger?

127
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,473
You put the flag in emergency position!

128
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,058
What is this?

129
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,561
I used the flag
to signal my uncle to come home.

130
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,813
<i>The spirits tell him the flag's position.</i>

131
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:06,981
DANGER - COME HOME - NORMAL

132
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,442
These guys were serious about flags
and smoke signals.

133
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,777
Uncle.

134
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,531
I unintentionally saw
my female friend changing clothes.

135
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,325
I want to be responsible.

136
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,243
-Could you please erase my memory?
-What!

137
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,079
I see. Let's wipe it clean.

138
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,874
Spirit of memory, deliver unto oblivio--

139
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:27,209
Stop!

140
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,962
Why would you do that, you idiot?

141
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,048
I don't mind it at all!

142
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,174
Fujimiya.

143
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,843
-Thank you.
-Stop it!

144
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,678
You haven't changed a bit.

145
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,639
You are so thoughtful.

146
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,433
Stop saying that!
Stop trying to wrap this up!

147
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,268
-Fujimiya…
-Is this the new coffee bean bag?

148
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,687
…you are being considerate to me
despite being embarrassed.

149
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,772
Should I make coffee?

150
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,982
-I'll do it again if you erase it!
-<i>Fujimiya…</i>

151
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,735
<i>hasn't changed at all.</i>
<i>She's a wonderful and a caring friend.</i>

152
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,237
-<i>I'm so happy that we reconnected.</i>
-Dimwit!

153
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,200
<i>I hope she feels the same as I do.</i>

Hey now.

157
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,628
Fujimiya, aren't you still underage?

158
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,130
I turn 20 today so it's perfectly legal.

159
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,257
Is that so? Happy birthday.

160
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,218
Thank you so much.

161
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,888
And you must be 34, as you'd been
in the other world since you were 17.

162
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:22,932
Around thirty?

163
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,979
No, my birthday passed so I'm actually 35.

164
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,064
I see.

165
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,440
Around forty then.

166
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,362
{\an8}<i>"Around 30" and "around 40"</i>

00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,284
we don't have anything special
for your birthday.

170
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,745
No, no. Don't worry about it.

171
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:47,581
Well, then at least let me impart
these words of wisdom.

172
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,126
It's my life's philosophy.

173
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,336
"A pinch is a chance."

174

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:05,015
you might be able to turn things around
just by changing your focus.

177
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:09,019
So no matter what adversity
or compromised situation you face,

178
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:12,481
it's crucial that you fight
to the very end.

179
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,905
That was a long explanation,
but I hope you never forget it.

180
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,032
I'm surprised to hear you impart wisdom.

181
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,451
Thank you so much.

182
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,286
"A pinch is a chance," huh?

183
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,497
Sounds deep when a YouTuber
who returned from another world says that.

184
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,458
Flattery will get you nowhere.

185
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,376
But now,

186
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,337
both of you
have reached the legal drinking age.

187
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,590
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

188
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,303
This was the very first time
I drank alcohol.

189
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,847
It was right after I turned 20.

190
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,807
-You're 20 there?
-You're 20 there?

191
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,017
That's right.

192
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,644
Everything I've shown you up until now
was before this image,

193
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,480
-so I was a teenager.
-A teenager?

194
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,984
I was so young then. I've really aged.

195
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,320
-Yeah.
-You're right.

196
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,946
<i>He looks exactly the same as before!</i>

197
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,199
<i>I can't tell how he's aged.</i>

198
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:12,208
Wow, so pretty.

199
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,337
Wow…

200
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,963
Ms. Tsundere!

201
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,174
I guess she was there too.

202
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:23,010
I thought I remembered
seeing her the next morning.

203
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:26,388
Is this pretty lady
the one your uncle transformed into?

204
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,682
Yeah, she is his stalker.

205
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,185
-Don't you mean the other way around?
-No. I said that right.

206
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,937
I don't know why, but she stalked him.

207
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,731
-Are you talking about <i>Land Stalker</i>?
-Uncle, stay out of this.

208
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,028
What a coincidence.

209
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,989
Other tables are available--

210
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,242
What the hell was that the other day?

211
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:49,495
You resealed the barrier above the city.

212
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,249
Where did you learn to do that?

213
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,004
Hey, try this.

214
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,428
What is this? It's pretty good.

215
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,514
There are other dishes too.

216
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:12,518
It'd be great if you don't tell a soul
that I broke the barrier.

217
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,937
-What?
-Please don't tell anyone.

218
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,359
How did you become so strong, orc face?

219
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:25,531
Because I worked hard
and trained countless times… by myself.

220
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,616
That's not what I mean.

221
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,828
<i>Three years ago, when I first met you…</i>

222
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,636
<i>you were obviously a novice fighter.</i>

223
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,139
<i>But you somehow managed to slay</i>
<i>the venom dragon.</i>

224
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,311
<i>I didn't know that was the venom dragon.</i>

225
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,938
Yes, it was. It was the venom dragon.

226
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,568
Did you fight without knowing what it was?
With no weapons nor training?

227
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,362
You'd have died in normal circumstances.
You stupid orc face--

228
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,033
What was I supposed to do?
I just wanted to save you.

229
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,750
Do you go around
seducing other girls like that?

230
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,462
When I slew the blaze dragon,
the girl really appreciated me.

231
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,340
The blaze dragon?

232
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,425
Did you use the god-freezing sword?

233
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,136
Were you recognized as a torchbearer
of the Ice clan?

234
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,847
-No. I defeated it without the sword.
-You can't be serious.

235
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:36,018
The legendary blaze dragon
is covered by magical blazing scales,

236
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,604
and you can only seal it with ice.

237
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,022
No, you are wrong.

238
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,565
A blaze for a blaze.

239
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:45,861
While the dragon is spitting fire,
a physical sword can deal some damage.

240
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,322
What? How did you figure that out?

241
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,575
I challenged it many times
with different strategies.

242
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,036
You don't believe me?

243
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,374
Here's the spoils from the battle.
It's bottled blaze.

244
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,669
Open it, and the blaze dragon
will come back to life.

245
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,003
Seriously?

246
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,588
You can always kill it again.

247
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,383
Sir Orc has nothing to fear, right?

248
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:09,134
That's not true.

249
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:13,097
The reason you can't beat it
is because you've given up from the start.

250
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,390
What did you say?

251
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,517
"A pinch is a chance."

252
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,851
What?

253
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,436
It's my motto.

254
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,983
A single move may turn the tables
even in the worst circumstances.

255
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:29,154
That's why you should never give up,
and you should keep trying.

256
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,409
Unexpectedly profound coming from you,
orc face. Who said that first?

257
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:36,620
<i>Puyo Puyo</i>'s strategy guidebook.

258
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,333
<i>When playing</i> Puyo Puyo<i>,</i>
<i>even when half the screen is gone,</i>

259
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,293
<i>don't give up and keep building.</i>

260
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,963
<i>You might strike a huge combo and win big.</i>

261
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,425
<i>He learned life lessons</i>
<i>from</i> Puyo Puyo<i>'s strategy guidebook.</i>

262
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,760
<i>I got tricked again.</i>

263
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:53,929
I've got an itch to play.

264
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,141
Do you want to play <i>Puyo Puyo Sun</i>
on the SEGA SATURN?

265
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,561
When you get tired of sitting there,
come join me.

266
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,272
<i>Uncle is already moving on</i>
<i>to the next thing.</i>

267
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,233
<i>Are you busy after this?</i>

268
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,319
<i>I booked a room at the inn.</i>
<i>Why don't you come with me?</i>

269
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,784
You think I'd follow you back
to your place that easily?

270
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,578
So you've shown your true colors, orc!

271
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,378
Don't touch me.

272
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,088
What?

273
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,465
Why?

274
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,383
-Let's go.
-Okay.

275
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,094
No, I didn't mean that.

276
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,388
Uncle.

277
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,433
Does he become an animal when he's drunk?

278
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,602
Can you guys join me
for a round of <i>Puyo Puyo</i>--

279
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:44,354
We're fine! Go play a single-player game
or something.

280
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,106
Here you are.

281
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,983
It's <i>Burning Rangers</i>.

282
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,277
It's not the same
without a multi controller.

283
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,073
You know how to handle him.

284
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,157
<i>Hey, you.</i>

285
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,035
W-- Walk straight.

286
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,119
Thank you.

287
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,749
I'm glad I have you to support me
when things are rough.

288
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,084
What?

289
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,046
You've been hiding your pain all along.

290
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,632
To be honest, it's been rough.

291
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,926
But I had you.

292
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,971
The room is on the second floor.

293
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:19,848
Okay.

294
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,689
I didn't realize I meant so much to you.

295
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,483
Here.

296
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,486
Now, where's that key?

297
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,285
You are such a slouch! Fine then.

298
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:45,499
I guess I have no choice
but to help you this way forever.

299
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,836
No. I'm good now.

300
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,093
You saved me!
Being drunk is rough, all right!

301
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,012
Thanks for helping me get back to my room.
See you later!

302
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,651
Takafumi, this game is much harder to play
without a multi-controller.

303
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:14,862
Did I fall asleep?

304
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,029
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

305
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,240
Let's skip to the following morning.

306
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,368
<i>My head is killing me.</i>

307
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:23,495
<i>Hey, orc face, you sleepyhead.</i>

308
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,165
-<i>What are we going to do today?</i>
-<i>Why are you here?</i>

309
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,001
<i>I'm going to try to clear</i>
<i>the death trap dungeon.</i>

310
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,961
Talk about resilience. This girl!

311
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,421
-Wait. Look at her eyes.
-What?

312
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,429
Nothing noteworthy… right?

313
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,186
-Fujimiya?
-I can't help but drink!

314
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,562
Oh, I get it.

315
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,314
Here. You must drink too!

316
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,773
{\an8}HEALING LEMON SOUR
ALCOHOL 5%

317
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,403
Uncle, you can stomach alcohol.

318
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,823
Of course, easy-peasy--

319
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,578
Shoot, I'm going to puke.

320
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,164
-I'm going home.
-Wait.

321
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,293
-You are the one who made him drunk.
-Don't worry. I'll take you home.

322
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,046
What? No, I'm okay.
I don't live that far--

323
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:15,547
Spirit of wind!

324
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,102
I'm so dizzy!

325
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,022
I can't fly well
without a multi controller.

326
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:36,526
Takafumi! Your uncle can't tell
reality apart from video games!

327
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,362
Uncle!

328
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,701
<i>My uncle couldn't hold his drink at all.</i>

329
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:49,414
<i>I told myself to never let him drink</i>
<i>a strong sour again.</i>

330
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:53,126
Let us down, Uncle!

331
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,071
DEATH TRAP DUNGEON

332
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,574
Are you hurt?
I told you not to follow me in here.

333
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,495
Were you poisoned? Let me suck it out.

334
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,914
-Leave it alone.
-How could I?

335
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:22,924
You must be uncomfortable.
I'll remove your armor.

336
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,134
What?

337
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,388
You can leave the bottom part on!

338
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,684
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

339
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,686
Is there anything I can do for you?

340
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,105
Could you please leave me alone?

341
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,692
Don't be dumb.
I can't leave you in this weakened state.

342
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,945
Is the binding too tight
around your belly?

343
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,116
Orc face…

344
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,994
-Well…
-What?

345
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,538
-Sorry.
-What?

346
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:09,054
{\an8}More like an aphrodisiac
in an adult manga than a poison.

347
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,472
{\an8}It actually exists.

348
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,683
{\an8}Uncle, the screen cut out.

349
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,020
{\an8}It's the effect
of the Elf's hair accessory.

350
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,064
{\an8}We can't read the memory
while it's in use.

351
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:23,068
She even used an item
to hide the antidote.

352
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,070
What a tightwad.

353
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,740
{\an8}That ought to show you the danger
of poison.

354
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,368
{\an8}Even that tough Elf almost died--

355
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,706
I want to poison Takafumi.
Can I have a dose?

356
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,834
Why? Oh, you're so scary.

357
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,919
