1
00:00:02,627 --> 00:00:05,046
How about earning money
as a pro baseball player?

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,095
If you use magic
to pitch at 625 miles per hour,

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:13,888
you can win a huge contract.

4
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:15,557
Over 100 million yens guaranteed.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,310
When I was in high school, I didn't like
the guys on the baseball team.

6
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,439
They acted like they owned the classroom.

7
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,523
If so--

8
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:27,986
But I knew that they practiced hard,
sweating under the brutal sun.

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:32,991
I don't want to trample on their efforts
by cheating with magic.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,743
<i>Uncle.</i>

11
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:40,707
For about six years,
from sixth to 11th grade,

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,002
I dedicated my life to <i>Alien Soldier</i>.

13
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,380
I understand how they must've felt,
'cause I sweat like they did.

14
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,258
<i>No way. Apologize to all the kids</i>
<i>who are serious about baseball.</i>

15
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:53,386
<i>My uncle means every word.</i>

16
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,264
{\an8}UNCLE:
YOU'RE FINE THE WAY YOU ARE

17
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,172
GET HOME

18
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,428
SOLD CHEAPER THAN A SCOURING PAD

19
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,646
{\an8}JUNE, 2018

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,652
Compared to other sports,
baseball terminology sounds dangerous.

21
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:35,029
You mean, dead balls and stolen bases?

22
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,948
And sacrifice flies and grand slams.

23
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,032
Exactly.

24
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,203
That reminds me,
I almost got assassinated once.

25
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,288
-What?
-What?

26
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,747
You are dropping a bomb.

27
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,916
<i>Icuras elran.</i>

28
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,880
On this day, I was totally exhausted
from delving into a dungeon.

29
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,229
Wait, this person…

30
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,108
was there when you broke
the barrier of Luvaldram.

31
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:15,486
<i>She was also there when he was with Elf.</i>

32
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,615
You're right. She was there.

33
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,491
Was she waiting for the right moment?

34
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,618
Seriously?

35
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,040
Found you.

36
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,697
Mabel.

37
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,700
What's the matter?

38
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,167
Because you slew
the legendary blaze dragon

39
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,171
without sealing it
with the god-freezing sword,

40
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:20,551
you released me from my duty
to hand the sword down to an heir.

41
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,178
Hooray!

42
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,181
Good for you. I'm glad
that my fight meant something to you.

43
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,936
He didn't get the sarcasm at all.

44
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,982
Because of my uncle,
Mabel's life spiraled.

45
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:40,113
Why don't you draw a sword?

46
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:44,284
I've been plagued by the intention
to kill with Psikyo bullets,

47
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,827
so I can tell.

48
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,748
You don't mean to kill me at all.

49
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:57,714
Actually, you don't look good.
Are you eating well?

50
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:22,155
I know that you saved the village.

51
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,418
So Mabel tried to kill me,

52
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,628
but, for the time being,
I took her to an inn.

53
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,005
<i>You dragged her.</i>

54
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,849
Where am I?

55
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,643
An inn. Here.

56
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,900
What happened? I thought you wanted
to be a hermit back at home.

57
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,240
When I returned, my house
had been cut down as logs for fireplaces.

58
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:11,746
<i>The mayor said</i>
<i>I need to provide for myself.</i>

59
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,206
MABEL - MANU

60
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,084
<i>If I didn't agree to it,</i>
<i>he would make me a village pet.</i>

61
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,086
<i>Another World is so messed up.</i>

62
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,339
<i>That's the villagers' long-held grudges</i>
<i>against the Ice clan.</i>

63
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,134
So, which one did you choose?

64
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,057
<i>I froze the villagers' feet</i>
<i>with the god-freezing sword,</i>

65
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,559
<i>dribbled some water around their necks,</i>
<i>then ran away.</i>

66
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,728
Wow, all of them?

67
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,188
All 108 villagers.

68
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,607
Oh, my God! So tenacious.

69
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,567
I can't go back anymore.

70
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,779
You really despise working, don't you?

71
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,115
Well…

72
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,618
Surrounded by flowers in a flower shop,

73
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,913
tasting samples at a bakery,

74
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,250
cuddling fluffy stuffed animals
in a doll shop.

75
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:02,130
I can't stand such harsh, heavy labor.

76
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,298
<i>Which part of these jobs was harsh?</i>

77
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:06,342
<i>Your standard is so damn low.</i>

78
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,469
I understand.

79
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,348
Working your life away
on the daily grind in an office,

80
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,685
attending drinking parties with coworkers
when work is done,

81
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,562
I wouldn't be able to handle that either.

82
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:20,857
<i>What? Uncle was planning on getting</i>
<i>a typical white-collar job?</i>

83
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,818
<i>Japanese society still had some leeway</i>
<i>18 years ago.</i>

84
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:25,319
{\an8}LIFE WAS ROUGH BACK THEN TOO

85
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,824
But I'm supporting myself
as an adventurer now.

86
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:34,036
It's the best job for finding a way
back to my world.

87
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,247
That's amazing.

88
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,833
I wish I could have something like that.

89
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,334
What? "Amazing"?

90
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,463
Well, in my own world,
I did beat <i>Alien Soldier</i> on Superhard

91
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,715
in under 30 minutes.

92
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,758
Is that supposed to be amazing?

93
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,469
Yeah, I'm an adventurer now,

94
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,680
thanks to the skills I learned
from video games.

95
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,894
-Your world?
-Mabel, you were a guardian all your life.

96
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,646
Maybe you can make a living
using the god-freezing sword.

97
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,150
The freezing magic you used earlier
was impressive.

98
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:09,238
I, the guardian, should use
the god-freezing sword?

99
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,325
-But my clan kept it for 400 years.
-Like I told you before,

100
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,746
no matter what anyone says,
this is your life, Mabel.

101
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,041
You choose what you want to do.

102
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,922
-The power to carry through is strength.
-The power to carry through is strength.

103
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,383
You remember it.

104
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,683
For now, maybe I should find a way
to break the seal of ice completely.

105
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,604
Oh, I went to Mount Marchid
to pick powa-powa blossoms after that,

106
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,189
but nothing happened.

107
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,273
Really?

108
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,903
The seal of ice linked up with my heart.

109
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,741
Maybe, if I become an adventurer
and fix my gloomy personality,

110
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,493
I may be able to make a living.

111
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,786
Gloomy?

112
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,830
I think being an introvert
is perfectly fine.

113
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,501
It's not fine.

114
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,963
The villagers said
my gloominess makes them depressed.

115
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,048
My eyes look puffy too.

116
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,758
I disagree.

117
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,218
It's fun talking with you.

118
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,721
Your eyes are attractive
like Heather from <i>Dynamite Headdy</i>.

119
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,266
Are you sure? You are making me blush.

120
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,395
Oh, that's right.
The one on your left hand.

121
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,479
What?

122
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,732
It's worth enough to get by
for the rest of your life.

123
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,903
This is to provide for your livelihood.

124
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:31,988
Please accept it.

125
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,615
No worries for the rest of my life?

126
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,119
<i>What is this geezer doing?</i>

127
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,328
<i>This is his second time.</i>

128
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,831
I put it on while you were sleeping.

129
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,001
Well, but…

130
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,671
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,758
I respect you, but it's nothing romantic.

132
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,971
I cannot accept this.

133
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,472
<i>It's melting!</i>

134
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,683
<i>Her icy heart, gone in a second.</i>

135
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,727
Yes, yes. It's okay, really.

136
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,646
No, it's not good.

137
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,692
Why? I rejected him, right? I did.

138
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:12,153
I said no, right?

139
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,281
I found it while exploring today.

140
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,075
Maybe this was meant to be.

141
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:23,039
There are only seven cosmite rings
in the world, and this is one of them.

142
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,498
This is my token of apology.

143
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,751
I can't accept such a precious ring.

144
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,503
Well, it's late now.
Stay here for tonight.

145
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,215
It's a small bed,
so there's not much room for two.

146
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,677
As Elf is staying here too,
she may let you stay in her room.

147
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,763
-Excuse me.
-What?

148
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,433
Do you have change I can use
for the public bath?

149
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,102
I haven't bathed in a while.

150
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,354
Do you think you stink?

151
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:52,985
You smell a little earthy,
but it's not a bad smell.

152
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,197
Don't smell me!

153
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:01,077
Well, if you sell the ring,
you can afford the bathing fee.

154
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,746
What? Sell the ring?

155
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,331
Yes.

156
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:09,418
As I said, sell the ring and never worry
about money for the rest of your life.

157
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,812
Hey, orc face! It's late in the night.

158
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,524
Did the orc instinct
turn you into a pervert?

159
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,402
If you don't mind, I can sleep with you.

160
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:01,095
<i>He turned me down.</i>

161
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:05,057
Hey, you. Lend me a hand.
She is out of control.

162
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,941
I see.

163
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,529
What are you doing? Stop it.

164
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:22,032
My defense is low because I spent
my spirits in the dungeon earlier today.

165
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,263
And that's how I was almost assassinated

166
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,932
and sealed with ice
until the next morning.

167
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,142
Isn't that horrible?

168
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,394
-Yeah.
-Yes.

169
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,355
-<i>You were horrible.</i>
-<i>You were horrible.</i>

170
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,317
Still, you are amazing.

171
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,278
You said you beat <i>Alien Soldier</i>
in 30 minutes?

172
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,115
To be precise,
it was 29 minutes and 29 seconds.

173
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,992
I was so into it.

174
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,494
Really?

175
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,957
I intentionally didn't use Homing Force.
But that was the key.

176
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,752
Just run through with Ranger Force
for easy battles…

177
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,338
I found a video online.
Someone beat it in 12 minutes.

178
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,848
How dare you, Internet?

179
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,309
It's not the Internet's fault, Uncle.

180
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,189
Speaking of the Internet,

181
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:40,110
what does it mean
by the North American version of the game?

182
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,613
Oh, you mean the region-coded games.

183
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:46,700
The same game can be in
different languages by the sales regions.

184
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,119
If it's in English, I'd be in trouble.

185
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,581
But I kind of understand what's said
at the beginning of <i>Altered Beast</i>.

186
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56,293
Like, "Go, brave men, to defeat the evil."

187
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,379
Wait, let me use a translation app.

188
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,843
<i>Rise from your grave.</i>

189
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:05,928
Grave?

190
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,097
Was the main character a dead man?

191
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,558
You were totally off.

192
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,059
<i>Why is that?</i>

193
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,644
<i>Maybe the blood of Another World.</i>

194
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,020
Wait, they are still talking.

195
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:19,984
<i>Maybe he shares our blood,</i>
<i>the blood of the Ice clan.</i>

196
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:24,446
<i>Because he is a transferee</i>
<i>from Irellars Japan Bahamal.</i>

197
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:27,283
Wait, she just said…

198
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,910
ALL CREATION - RESIDENCE
ICE STORM

199
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:33,289
-Hey, she just said "Japan Bahamal."
-What?

200
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,874
How do they know about Japan?

201
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,001
Let's take a look.

202
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:41,297
<i>What a disaster that he put the ring</i>
<i>on you while you were sleeping.</i>

203
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,340
Marriage while sleeping,

204
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,801
rather, a forced marriage by an orc
while sleeping,

205
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,553
it's a lifelong trauma.

206
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,266
No one would marry you
after you married a filthy orc.

207
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,767
Don't despair.

208
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,942
Actually, you don't seem to mind it.
Why is that?

209
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,947
Maybe the blood of Another World.

210
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:12,244
Maybe he shares our blood,
the blood of the Ice clan.

211
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,831
Because he is a transferee
from Irellars Japan Bahamal.

212
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:21,545
I see.
They talked while I was sealed in ice.

213
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,340
They were talking about Japan, right?

214
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:30,054
<i>Raybelio yuul elran.</i>

215
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,270
The patriarch of the Ice clan

216
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:43,192
was a knight from Japan Bahamal
about 400 years ago.

217
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:47,780
<i>He lost his life in a war</i>
<i>in Japan Bahamal.</i>

218
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:52,242
<i>He was given a new body and life</i>
<i>in Granbahamal.</i>

219
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,454
<i>Then he received a message from God.</i>

220
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,665
<i>"Hear me, transferee.</i>

221
00:15:57,748 --> 00:16:02,378
<i>I shall grant you one wish</i>
<i>to survive this harsh world."</i>

222
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,631
<i>The knight responded with his wish.</i>

223
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,884
<i>"Give me a sword that can slay you."</i>

224
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,097
<i>Divine bonus, a classic pattern</i>
<i>of the</i> Isekai <i>reincarnation fantasy.</i>

225
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,099
<i>The samurai's reply was rebellious</i>
<i>and so cool.</i>

226
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,225
<i>What did the god say?</i>

227
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,978
The god responded,

228
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,772
"You wish to have the power to slay God.

229
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,983
Ha ha, how interesting."

230
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:28,445
Moreover, does that ugly orc face
look like a human to you?

231
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,990
-"Ha ha, how interesting."
-Is it because you share a homeland?

232
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,282
-"Interesting."
-Seriously?

233
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,659
-"Interesting."
-You can't mean that.

234
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,539
It's getting interesting.

235
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,417
-Could you be a little patient?
-I read a book about hometowns.

236
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,793
Shoo, shoo.

237
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,339
The knight acquired the god-freezing sword
and studied at the Shrine of Wisdom,

238
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,883
fell in love with a shrine maiden,
broke the seal of the sword,

239
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,552
and slew the legendary blaze dragon.

240
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,887
It's been kept in the clan
for generations.

241
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,143
She just spoiled the best part!

242
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,856
Back to my point,
do you see the orc face as…

243
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:08,152
Telling this story was the only thing
I'm confident at.

244
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,115
All my practice efforts…

245
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,368
I'm sorry. Don't cry.

246
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,122
There, there.

247
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,875
I didn't get that.

248
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,959
-Huh?
-What?

249
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,588
I didn't get such a great bonus
like the god-freezing sword!

250
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:32,092
You must have received magic power
as the divine bonus.

251
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,345
I didn't get any bonus!
Actually, I even didn't talk with a god!

252
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,516
Then let's look at the moment
you were transferred 18 years ago.

253
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,602
-You're right.
-Eighteen years?

254
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,353
Can you rewind that many years?

255
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,981
It's been a long time
and may take a while to search.

256
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,358
Well…

257
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,945
Mob lynches, execution, execution…

258
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,822
He's mumbling disturbing things.

259
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,201
He was hunted down as an orc variant
from the very beginning.

260
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,285
Seriously?

261
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,369
Found it.

262
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,540
<i>You shitty orc!</i>
<i>Are you trying to eat my cow?</i>

263
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,542
No, Uncle. This isn't the right one.

264
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,627
Then how about this one?

265
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,172
<i>Burn this pagan evil orc!</i>

266
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,257
It's the time you made the magical vase.

267
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,967
-This one?
-Nope.

268
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,344
-How about this one?
-Nope.

269
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,054
Then this one.

270
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,847
You've been hunted too many times!

271
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,475
I'm a real heavy sleeper.

272
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,936
If I was attacked while asleep,
I couldn't avoid getting hanged.

273
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,396
I wonder how you survived
to tell the tale.

274
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,940
How about this?

275
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,776
What's going on?

276
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,612
It's similar to the resurrection spell
of divine magic.

277
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,074
I thought I found this magic
much later on.

278
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,159
Why does this appear in an old memory?

279
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,163
Wait. Isn't that you when you were 17,
right when you arrived in Another World?

280
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,248
I see.

281
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:48,127
This was how my body was formed
in Granbahamal.

282
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,383
Did a god create your body?

283
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,676
Seems like it.

284
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,976
This is where I was mistaken for
an orc variant and got beat up.

285
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,980
I didn't know their language,
but I offered them my money.

286
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,483
They mistook the cash for spell cards
and beat me even more.

287
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:18,532
January, 2000. I was gonna buy new video
games with my holiday money envelopes.

288
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,077
I was so happy, but got in an accident
on the way, and the rest is history.

289
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,663
What was I going to buy?

290
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,166
-<i>What a heavy story.</i>
-<i>What a heavy story.</i>

291
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,336
Wait. I hear something.

292
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,380
Could it be the god's voice?

293
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,632
Wait, let me turn up the volume.

294
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,636
<i>I'm the god of Another World,</i>
<i>and you are a transferee.</i>

295
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,680
<i>To survive this harsh world…</i>

296
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,851
-<i>No idea what is being said.</i>
-<i>Maybe the god mixed up the region code.</i>

297
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:50,022
I couldn't hear it
while I was getting clobbered senseless.

298
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,192
Uncle, I will translate it.
Please rewind 30 seconds.

299
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,401
Okay.

300
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,113
<i>Hello, dear customers.</i>

301
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,198
WELCOME TO GRANBAHAMAL

302
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,365
{\an8}In-store announcement?

303
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,826
{\an8}Totally prerecorded.

304
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,539
She is saying, "I will give you power."
It's just as Mabel said.

305
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,585
I see. What I wished at that moment
became my ability.

306
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:13,337
Your powers must have awakened then.

307
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,048
You can triumph
with unrivaled magic power now.

308
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,635
Your wish was "I want the power
to exterminate these shitheads."

309
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:24,848
Or "Make them miserable and
make them regret ever being born." Right?

310
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:29,436
Takafumi, did something happen to you
while you were in high school?

311
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:30,604
{\an8}HIS FAMILY FELL APART

312
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:33,899
No, what I was thinking was…

313
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,193
<i>If only I could…</i>

314
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,696
<i>If only I could speak their language,</i>
<i>we could understand each other.</i>

315
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,448
Oh, this one.

316
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,619
Well…

317
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,289
"Approved. Your wish has been granted.

318
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:54,544
You can acquire the minimum knowledge
if you go to Mount Dordo," said God.

319
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,797
So, then, Uncle's magic power was…

320
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,840
-translation?
-Guess so.

321
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,925
<i>So lame.</i>

322
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:04,638
Suddenly, I understood their language,
but I guess that was my bonus.

323
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:09,643
So you could have learned the language
at Mount Dordo?

324
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,980
{\an8}<i>…am not…</i>

325
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,401
{\an8}<i>I'm not an orc!</i>

326
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,237
Oh, I see.

327
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,781
This is how you spoke to each other.

328
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,867
Well, this is quite expected of Uncle,
in a way.

329
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:26,952
No.

330
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,665
I was sold to a freak show as a rare orc
who understood human words.

331
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,794
I cost three bronze coins.

332
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,214
-And then…
-Wait, Uncle!

333
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,592
I want a cup of coffee.

334
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,636
Me too.

335
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,098
That's a good idea.
Let's have a coffee break.

336
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,062
<i>The god seemed to have lost interest</i>
<i>in his responsibilities.</i>

337
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,316
<i>And the residents of Another World</i>
<i>were shitty, as always.</i>

338
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:02,029
<i>The terribly heavy story</i>
<i>seemed to have no end,</i>

339
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,656
<i>so we decided to have a coffee break.</i>

340
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,284
-Delish.
-Good beans.

341
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,786
What a profoundly deep flavor.

342
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:40,919
