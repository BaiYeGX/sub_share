197

No.

This ship will reach Ehime by morning.

285
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,502
Apparently, that cat placed a curse on me.

00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,972
After drinking all night?

945
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,139
Sure, why not?

946
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,808
Join us, Souta.

947
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,893
Didn't expect the potato salad, though.

948
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:09,269
- H-Hey!
- I'm making this for my boyfriend.

949
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,896
What boyfriend?

950
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,397
I'll have one in no time.

951
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,108
What's with that chair?

952
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,275
Adorable.

953
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,276
A kid's chair?

954
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,737
Why are you on it?

955
00:53:17,862 --> 00:53:18,946
A Kobe souvenir...?

956
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,655
You're not making any sense.

957
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,413
They must've thought you were weird.

958
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,999
Really?

959
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,418
Do you travel like this all the time?

960
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:34,920
Not all the time.

961
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,505
I have a flat in Tokyo.

962
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:40,592
After college, I plan to be a teacher.

963
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:43,678
What!? You're a university student?

964
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:44,679
Yeah?

965
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,723
And...a job!?

966
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,099
What about THIS job!?

967
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,477
Being a Closer has been in my family for generations.

968
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:51,812
I'll continue that.

969
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:54,564
But it doesn't put food on the table.

970
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:55,983
I see...

971
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,943
But it's an important job.

972
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:02,072
Most important jobs, people shouldn't see.

973
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,699
I need to get back into my own body.

974
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:07,870
So I can continue this and become a teacher.

975
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,043
But... I'm already...

976
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,300
Perhaps, I'm...

977
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,762
already...

978
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,562
It's getting farther.

979
00:54:34,021 --> 00:54:35,815
The light grows dimmer.

980
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,691
And so do the voices.

981
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:39,609
My body...

982
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,486
My mind...

983
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,406
It's so...

984
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,574
Cold.

985
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:46,867
I'm so cold.

986
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,536
Cold...

987
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,095
Am I...

988
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,483
Is this where...

989
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,235
I meet my end?

990
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:31,703
Souta?

991
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:33,998
Souta!?

992
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,213
Good morning.

993
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,714
Took you long enough.

994
00:55:42,882 --> 00:55:45,800
Hey, there's another photo of Daijin.

995
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,594
See?

996
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,721
Suzume.

997
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:51,473
Did...

998
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,600
Did you just do something to me?

999
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,102
Nope.

1000
00:55:56,186 --> 00:56:00,815
- The Chugoku Expressway south towards Okayama...
- I was counting on you to help me at the bar tonight, too.

1001
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:04,028
Here, this is for you.

1002
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:07,656
You look even more like a runaway child now.

1003
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:11,160
Rumi, thank you so much for everything.

1004
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,577
Mmhmm.

1005
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,830
Just be sure to send word to your guardian.

1006
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:16,790
I will.

1007
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:17,832
Ah, crap!

1008
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,834
I totally forgot about Tamaki.

1009
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,336

1010
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,005
She's coming to get me?

1011
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,090
Suzume, you can make the next train.

1012
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,092
Buy a ticket. Hurry!

1013
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,136
The bullet train?

1014
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,097
We know where Daijin is, so...

1015
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,891
It's the quickest way, right?

1016
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,267
To Tokyo, though?

1017
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,102
That'll take all my savings.

1018
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,022
You better pay me back, Mr. College Man.

1019
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:41,523
I gotcha.

1020
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,359
Souta, look!

1021
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:45,527
What is it?

1022
00:56:46,195 --> 00:56:47,988
This train is SO fast.

1023
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:49,448
Cool!

1024
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:50,699
Yeah...it's fast.

1025
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:53,953
We will soon arrive at Atami. The doors on the...

1026

1027
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,165
What's wrong?

1028
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:01,585
Did we just miss Mt. Fuji?

1029
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:02,461
Look!

1030
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,255
Why didn't you say something!?

1031
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,966
Ahh, right...

1032
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,134
I wanted to see it...

1033
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,469
Sorry...

1034
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,973
We'll soon be arriving at Tokyo.

1035
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:18,852
Tokyo. This is the final stop.

1036
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:20,645
That way, Suzume.

1037
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:21,313
Okay!

1038
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:22,064
Right.

1039
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:22,731
Left.

1040
00:57:23,065 --> 00:57:23,898
Go up.

1041
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,276
Train on the left.

1042
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,236
Run!

1043
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,489
Get off, next stop.

00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:31,365
Wha--!?

1045
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,871
Why do I feel like your horse?

1046
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:40,749
Before Daijin, there's a place I want to go.

1047
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,418
Could you make a call?

1048
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,011
Welcome!

1049
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,143
Um, my name is Iwato.

00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,811
I just phoned...

00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,273
Oh, right.

1052
00:58:04,398 --> 00:58:06,150
Souta's relative.

1053
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,901
I heard about you.

1054
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,404
Here's the key to his room.

1055
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,822
Room 301.

1056
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:14,283
Take your time.

1057
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,621
Well, aren't you popular, Souta?

1058
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:23,083
When is he coming back from his trip?

1059
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,044
It's a bit lonely without him.

1060
00:58:25,169 --> 00:58:26,961
"He's so sweet and cute!"

1061
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,422
And gorgeous.

1062
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:30,590

I want to look something up.

See the cardboard box on top of the shelf?

1068
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,155
Grab it for me.

1069
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,156
Sure.

00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,327
Oof...

00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,253
Souta, can I step on you?

Then does that mean...

1081

...there are two Keystones.

Where in Tokyo it is.

Apparently, there's a huge Gate there too.

01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:11,065
It opened 100 years ago and decimated the Kanto region.

1319
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:38,855
Souta?

1320
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:49,448
Is this...?

1321
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,912
Tokyo's Gate!?

1322
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:05,924
Souta!?

1323
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:19,687
I can't get in.

1324
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,648
He's in the Ever-After.

1325
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:24,108
Souta.

1326
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,151
Souta?

1327
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:26,444
Souta!

1328
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,404
SOUTA!

1329
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:31,950
Suzume?

1330
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:38,957
Finally, just the two of us!

1331
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:41,834
This is all your fault!

1332
01:13:41,960 --> 01:13:43,211
Give me Souta back!

1333
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:44,045
Can't.

1334
01:13:44,170 --> 01:13:44,921
Why?

1335
01:13:45,046 --> 01:13:46,923
He's not human anymore.

1336
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,010
Then make him human!

1337
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:52,720
Suzume, that hurts.

1338
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:53,679
Bring him BACK!

1339
01:13:53,804 --> 01:13:55,598
I said that hurts!

1340
01:13:55,723 --> 01:13:56,975
You--!

1341
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,936
You don't love me?

1342
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:01,229
How could I--!?

1343
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:02,396
You love me, right?

1344
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:03,481
I HATE--!

1345
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,993
Go away.

1346
01:14:16,244 --> 01:14:18,246
Don't ever talk to me again.

1347
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:22,500
Suzume doesn't love me...

1348
01:14:36,973 --> 01:14:39,308
I promise, I'll come save you.

1349
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:41,978
I return to you...

1350
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:07,753
What--!?

1351
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:26,022
Hey, look at that girl.

1352
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,523
She's not wearing any shoes.

1353
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,775
You're right. Ew.

1354
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:37,033
Just look at her clothes.

1355
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:38,367
That girl over there.

1356
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:39,243
Is she barefoot?

1357
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:40,286
For real?

1358
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,582
Munakata's condition has stabilized.

1359
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:47,710
Yeah, it was pretty bad yesterday.

1360
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,587
[HITSUJIRO MUNAKATA]
Souta's...

1361
01:16:02,766 --> 01:16:05,894
Souta failed, didn't he?

1362
01:16:06,019 --> 01:16:07,230
I-I'm sorry for barging in...

1363
01:16:07,355 --> 01:16:11,817
I heard from Souta that you were in the hospital.

1364
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:18,324
Did he drag you into this?

1365
01:16:19,117 --> 01:16:22,035
What is the fate of my grandson?

1366
01:16:23,454 --> 01:16:26,165
He became a Keystone and went to the Ever-After...

1367
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,334
I see.

1368
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:32,838
I saw the worm from my window yesterday.

1369
01:16:33,464 --> 01:16:36,217
I wanted nothing more than to go myself...

1370
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:40,471
but this old body of mine wouldn't listen.

1371
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:44,933
That's why I want to know how to enter the Ever-After.

1372
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:48,104
Why?

1373
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:50,564
Huh? Because... we have to save Souta!

1374
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,525
That isn't necessary.

1375
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,567
What?

1376
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:57,070
Souta will spend decades now

1377
01:16:57,196 --> 01:17:00,741
as a Keystone housing the gods.

1378
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:04,370
He is no longer of our realm.

1379
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,829
How could...

1380
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,123
But there must be a way to--

1381
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:11,127
Are you trying to waste my grandson's sacrifice?

1382
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,085
What?

1383
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:15,047
Who is the one who pierced the worm?

1384
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:17,466
Did you, with Souta?

1385
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:18,301
But that was...

1386
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:19,635
ANSWER ME!

1387
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:20,636
It was me!

1388
01:17:21,011 --> 01:17:22,305
I see.

1389
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:24,056
That's fine!

1390
01:17:24,182 --> 01:17:27,476
If you didn't, millions would have died!

1391
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,604
Take pride in your deed, keep your mouth shut,

1392
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,524
and return to whence you came!

1393
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:43,242
This world is not for the ordinary.

1394
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:46,370
Forget everything that happened.

1395
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,039
How could I forget?

1396
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:51,959
I'll open the underground Gate again.

1397
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:54,295
What!? What are you saying?

1398
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,921
I have to get in!

1399
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:56,880
Impossible.

1400
01:17:57,005 --> 01:17:58,632
You cannot enter it there!

1401
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:00,884
You mustn't open the Gate!

1402
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:02,135
Wait!

1403
01:18:14,232 --> 01:18:16,692
The Ever-After is a beautiful place.

1404
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,819
But it is the domain of the departed.

1405
01:18:19,111 --> 01:18:22,072
Does that not scare you?

1406
01:18:22,406 --> 01:18:23,907
It doesn't.

1407
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,952
Whether one lives or dies is a matter of luck.

1408
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,704
I've always felt that way.

1409
01:18:29,162 --> 01:18:29,955
But...

1410
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:34,252
I'm afraid of a world without Souta.

1411
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:47,931
There is but one Gate through which
people may traverse in their lifetime.

1412
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:50,976
You've been to the Ever-After before, no?

1413
01:18:51,394 --> 01:18:53,854
What did you see there?

1414
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:55,731
That was...

1415
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:57,733
A young version of myself.

1416
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:01,404
And, my mom...who passed away.

1417
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:07,993
I suspect you got lost in the Ever-After when you were young.

1418
01:19:14,166 --> 01:19:18,504
You must find THAT Gate. From back then.

1419
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,559
It has been far too long.

1420
01:19:32,059 --> 01:19:35,438
I see you are finally unbound.

1421
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:40,734
Do you wish to follow that girl?

1422
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:44,071
I entrust everything to you.

1423
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:25,863
I'm borrowing your shoes, Souta.

1424
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,336
Hey!

1425
01:20:40,461 --> 01:20:42,295
Hey, you!

1426
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,089
Suzume!

1427
01:20:45,424 --> 01:20:47,134
Serizawa?

1428
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,301
Where are you going?

1429
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,137
To find Souta?

1430
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,556
To find a door.

1431
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,391
What?

1432
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:54,892
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

1433
01:20:55,017 --> 01:20:56,977
Hey, I looked everywhere for you!

1434
01:20:57,102 --> 01:20:57,603
What are--

1435
01:20:57,728 --> 01:20:59,021
The cousin thing's a lie, right?

1436
01:20:59,146 --> 01:21:00,063
Why does it matter?

1437
01:21:00,398 --> 01:21:01,314
- Get in.
- What?

1438
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:02,941
You're going after Souta, right?

1439
01:21:03,066 --> 01:21:04,985
Then, I'll take you.

1440
01:21:05,318 --> 01:21:06,404
Why would you--!?

1441
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:08,572
I'm worried about my friend, okay!?

1442
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:10,323
- What's that?
- A fight?

1443
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:11,116
There you are!

1444
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:12,410
Suzume!!

1445
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:14,453
W-What? Tamaki?

1446
01:21:14,578 --> 01:21:17,665
Do you have ANY idea how worried I've been!?

1447
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:20,083
And you! You stay away from her.

1448
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,334
Or I'll call the police.

1449
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,169
Who're you?

1450
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,004
Is this the guy who came to our house?

1451
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:26,048
Whatever he told you is a lie.

1452
01:21:26,214 --> 01:21:27,425
We're going.

1453
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:29,134
I'm sorry, but I can't yet.

1454
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:30,511
Suzume!

1455
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,304
Serizawa, let's go.

1456
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,764
O-Okay.

1457
01:21:35,849 --> 01:21:36,600
H-Hey!

1458
01:21:36,725 --> 01:21:37,350
Suzume!

1459
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:38,894
What the heck is wrong with you!?

1460
01:21:39,019 --> 01:21:40,563
I can't let you go alone.

1461
01:21:40,688 --> 01:21:42,856
- Tamaki, get out.
- Come here, Suzume.

1462
01:21:42,981 --> 01:21:44,692
This car has doors, you know!

1463
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:46,234
Is he two-timing?

1464
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:47,445
Men are such pigs.

1465
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,738
- Yeah, and you ignored them!
- Let's all calm dow--

1466
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:50,448
Are you guys...

1467
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:51,865
done yet?

1468
01:21:54,577 --> 01:21:56,620
- Daijin?
- A cat spoke!?

1469
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:58,205
What? Of course not...

1470
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:00,499
Yeah, you're right.

1471
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,126
Sure, cats don't talk.

1472
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:04,712
More importantly...

1473
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:08,466
[Destination confirmed.]
- Serizawa, can you take us here?

1474
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:10,217
W-Whaaat!? This is far!

1475
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,052
Suzume, isn't this...?

1476
01:22:12,177 --> 01:22:14,472
You said you would take me, didn't you?

1477
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,641
Please, I have to go there.

1478
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:23,981
Seriously...?

1479
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,984
Guess we're not comin' back tonight...

1480
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:34,241
What are you trying to pull?

1481
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:49,548
♪ In order to see his mom...

1482
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:55,763
♪ I boarded the train all on my own!

1483
01:22:56,304 --> 01:23:03,020
♪ ...the twilit cityscape and cars passing by

1484
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:07,983
♪ I watched out the corner of my eye.

1485
01:23:08,108 --> 01:23:09,610
Do you mind?

1486
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:12,530
What? This is the perfect road trip song.

1487
01:23:12,655 --> 01:23:14,447
And we have a cat...

1488
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:16,534
Suzume's not listening.

1489
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:18,368
She's asleep.

1490
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:21,288
Hey, is that cat hers?

1491
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,749
We don't have any cats.

1492
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:25,292
Serizawa...

1493
01:23:25,543 --> 01:23:27,335
You're a teacher in training?

1494
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,295
Um, yeah...

1495
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:29,797
I wanna become one.

1496
01:23:32,382 --> 01:23:34,009
Is this car okay?

1497
01:23:34,134 --> 01:23:36,386
It's used. I got it super cheap.

1498
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:37,555
Cool, huh?

1499
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:40,098

1680
01:33:45,995 --> 01:33:46,663
Huh?

1681
01:33:46,788 --> 01:33:49,291
I'm choosing the songs that suit my audience.

1682
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:52,210
You appreciate the oldies, right, Suzume?

1683
01:33:55,297 --> 01:33:56,881
Guess the rain ain't done yet...

1684
01:33:57,006 --> 01:33:57,965
Right, newcomer?

1685
01:33:58,591 --> 01:34:00,677
How did we pick up another stray?

1686
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:02,720
And a huge one, at that.

1687
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:04,722
Hey, a rainbow.

1688
01:34:04,847 --> 01:34:06,641
Now there's a good sign.

1689
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:10,353
Man.

1690
01:34:10,478 --> 01:34:12,730
Tough crowd.

1691
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:19,362
Suzume, cats don't follow people without a reason.

1692
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,239
Unlike dogs.

1693
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:23,491
Those black and white cats...

1694
01:34:23,866 --> 01:34:26,869
must really want something from you.

1695
01:34:26,994 --> 01:34:28,120
Precisely.

1696
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:28,996
Wha--!?

1697
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:31,999
Return everything as it was, with human hands.

1698
01:34:34,794 --> 01:34:36,003
It spoke!

1699
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,384
Ah...hey, hey, he--

1700
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,678
You're kidding me...

1701
01:34:55,022 --> 01:34:56,524
Hey, it's fixed.

1702
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:02,029
Oh, come on!

1703
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:04,532
That could've ended much worse.

1704
01:35:04,866 --> 01:35:08,077
Never mind that. Did those cats just talk?

1705
01:35:08,203 --> 01:35:11,498
T-They totally did, didn't they?

1706
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:12,582
What the heck was that?

1707
01:35:12,707 --> 01:35:13,500
Supernatural stuff?

1708
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,252
Nah, that can't be possible.

1709
01:35:15,377 --> 01:35:16,794
Excuse me!

1710
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,713
They won't stop.

1711
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:21,299
Serizawa!

1712
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:23,301
We're about 10km out, right?

1713
01:35:23,635 --> 01:35:26,429
[Approximately 20km to your destination.]

1714
01:35:26,596 --> 01:35:28,097
More like 20.

1715
01:35:28,223 --> 01:35:29,599
It's still quite a ways away.

1716
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:30,808
[Return to the designated route.]

1717
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:31,684
I KNOW!

1718
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:33,060
I'm gonna run the rest.

1719
01:35:33,936 --> 01:35:35,980
Thank you so much, Serizawa!

1720
01:35:36,105 --> 01:35:37,274
You too, Tamaki!

1721
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,536
I'm going too.

1722
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:52,664
Thanks for getting us this far.

1723
01:35:55,207 --> 01:35:58,878
I think you might actually make a great teacher...

1724
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:03,090
H-Hey, you guys...!

1725
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:07,595
What the heck was that all about?

1726
01:36:12,725 --> 01:36:15,562
Man, I envy you, Souta.

1727
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:30,327
Tamaki?

1728
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:32,495
I give up.

1729
01:36:33,996 --> 01:36:38,167
This is about you chasing someone you love, right?

1730
01:36:39,419 --> 01:36:41,128
Th-This isn't a love thing.

1731
01:36:44,882 --> 01:36:45,925
Hey, Suzume...

1732
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:47,719
Who are these guys?

1733
01:36:47,844 --> 01:36:49,387
They're supposed to be gods?

1734
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:50,680
Gods!?

1735
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:57,186
What I said, in the parking lot...

1736
01:36:58,062 --> 01:37:00,315
Sure, I've felt that way at times...

1737
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:02,734
But that's not the only thing I've felt.

1738
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:03,693
Yeah.

1739
01:37:04,276 --> 01:37:07,029
You understand it's not the only thing...

1740
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:09,616
Me too.

1741
01:37:10,742 --> 01:37:12,452
I'm sorry, Tamaki.

1742
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:17,499
Your first time home in 12 years.

1743
01:37:30,094 --> 01:37:32,555
I'm home, Mommy!

1744
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:39,061
I'm home, Mom.

1745
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:44,484
Look at how much she's grown, Sis.

1746
01:37:45,527 --> 01:37:49,238
I have no idea what she's about to do.

1747
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,664
Found it.

1748
01:38:02,794 --> 01:38:08,508
[SUZUME'S IMPORTANT STUFF]

1749
01:38:09,467 --> 01:38:11,010
A diary?

1750
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:12,053
Yeah.

1751
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:14,764
I don't remember exactly what happened back then.

1752
01:38:14,889 --> 01:38:17,850
But, I do remember wandering through a door...

1753
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:31,280
[MARCH 11]

1754
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:36,118
[Tsunami warning.]

1755
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:42,792
[Those near the ocean,
please evacuate to high ground immediately.]

1756
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:45,462
Have you seen my mommy?

1757
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,839
- Are you alone?
- She was working at the hospital.

1758
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:48,965
Have you seen my mommy?

1759
01:38:49,006 --> 01:38:52,469
- They haven't found Tsubame?
- That girl's still looking today.

1760
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:54,220
Do you know where my mommy is?

1761
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:56,263
- She's only four...
- Her mother's probably--

1762
01:38:56,305 --> 01:38:58,182
- The poor thing.
- Have you seen my mommy...?

1763
01:38:58,224 --> 01:38:59,141
She's all alone.

1764
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:01,769
- I'm sorry, Suzume.
- My mommy...!

1765
01:39:01,894 --> 01:39:03,270
Sorry.

1766
01:39:03,395 --> 01:39:04,647
Mommy...!

1767
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:06,649
Where are you?

1768
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:12,947
It wasn't...a dream.

1769
01:39:13,781 --> 01:39:16,075
That's right, the moon was full that night.

1770
01:39:16,493 --> 01:39:18,870
Right by that telephone pole.

1771
01:39:19,746 --> 01:39:20,788
What?

1772
01:39:20,913 --> 01:39:22,457
You're looking for this door?

1773
01:39:22,582 --> 01:39:24,834
Hey, Suzume!

1774
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:28,671
It's been 12 years! The rubble's probably long gone!

1775
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,802
Where...?

1776
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,681
Suzume.

1777
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:41,017
Daijin?

1778
01:39:44,186 --> 01:39:45,938
Hey, what're...?

1779
01:40:01,954 --> 01:40:04,456
Daijin, have you...?

1780
01:40:04,791 --> 01:40:08,460
Have you been guiding us to the open doors all this time?

1781
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:10,630
This whole time...

1782
01:40:16,553 --> 01:40:17,929
Whoa...!

1783
01:40:18,555 --> 01:40:20,306
Thank you so much, Daijin!

1784
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,226
Let's go, Suzume!

1785
01:40:26,228 --> 01:40:27,730
Suzume!

1786
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:28,898
Tamaki.

1787
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:30,399
I'm going!

1788
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:31,984
Going where?

1789
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:33,485
To see the person I love!

1790
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:42,244
Suzume...?

1791
01:40:54,381 --> 01:40:56,133
The ground is on fire.

1792
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:00,262
That's...

1793
01:41:00,805 --> 01:41:01,973
The worm!

1794
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:08,646
It's going for the Gate!

1795
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:20,783
Sadaijin?

1796
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:38,050
Is that...?

1797
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:39,551
Souta!?

1798
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:00,072
Daijin, you...!

1799
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:04,326
Suzume, are you okay?

1800
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:08,580
What is this place?

1801
01:42:09,581 --> 01:42:11,542
This is the Ever-After?

1802
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:14,170
It's Souta!

1803
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:03,052
Souta!

1804
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:04,511
Souta!!

1805
01:43:04,636 --> 01:43:05,304
SOUTA!

1806
01:43:12,394 --> 01:43:13,062
Suzume.

1807
01:43:13,645 --> 01:43:14,897
If you take the Keystone,

1808
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:16,774
the worm will escape.

1809
01:43:16,899 --> 01:43:18,567
I'll become the Keystone!

1810
01:43:20,027 --> 01:43:21,403
So please...

1811
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:25,616
Wake up, Souta!

1812
01:43:28,703 --> 01:43:29,453
You...

1813
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:43,760
Souta!

1814
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:46,721
I've come this far!

1815
01:43:47,388 --> 01:43:49,306
Please, answer me!

1816
01:43:50,141 --> 01:43:51,308
Souta!

1817
01:43:51,433 --> 01:43:53,060
Let me hear your voice.

1818
01:43:53,269 --> 01:43:54,686
SOUTA!

1819
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,563
SOUTA!!!

1820
01:44:02,862 --> 01:44:04,446
Hey, you...

1821
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:08,951
Do you know of any ruins in this area?

1822
01:44:09,368 --> 01:44:10,327
Ruins...?

1823
01:44:12,914 --> 01:44:15,666
Are you not afraid to die!?

1824
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:16,583
I'm not!

1825
01:44:16,708 --> 01:44:18,460
We make a great team!

1826
01:44:18,585 --> 01:44:20,587
I think I'm doing something pretty important!

1827
01:44:20,838 --> 01:44:21,923
Join us.

1828
01:44:22,173 --> 01:44:24,591
Well, aren't you popular, Souta?

1829
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:25,968
Wait!

1830
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:27,469
Is this...?

1831
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:28,470
Yeah.

1832
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:31,223
This is it...

1833
01:44:31,640 --> 01:44:33,350
This is where I end?

1834
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:35,937
Souta's memories?

1835
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:39,190
- Souta?
- But, I was able to meet you.

1836
01:44:39,190 --> 01:44:40,024
- Souta!
- But, I was able to meet you.

1837
01:44:40,191 --> 01:44:41,525
Hey! Souta!

1838
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:43,610
I finally met you!

1839
01:44:43,735 --> 01:44:44,695
SOUTA!

1840
01:44:44,987 --> 01:44:46,197
I don't want to disappear.

1841
01:44:46,322 --> 01:44:47,448
I want to live!

1842
01:44:47,656 --> 01:44:48,699
I want to keep living!

1843
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:50,367
I'm afraid to die!

1844
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:51,743
I want to live.

1845
01:44:51,869 --> 01:44:52,870
To live...

1846
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:53,871
To live.

1847
01:44:54,246 --> 01:44:55,539
More!

1848
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,335
So do I!

1849
01:45:00,002 --> 01:45:02,088
I want to live more...

1850
01:45:02,379 --> 01:45:03,630
I want to hear your voice.

1851
01:45:03,840 --> 01:45:05,257
I don't want to be alone.

1852
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:07,343
I'm afraid to die.

1853
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:08,677
Souta...

1854
01:45:46,507 --> 01:45:47,716
Souta...?

1855
01:45:49,676 --> 01:45:51,220
Suzume?

1856
01:45:53,514 --> 01:45:54,806
What was I...?

1857
01:45:57,643 --> 01:45:58,895
Daijin?

1858
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:00,897
What's wrong?

1859
01:46:01,563 --> 01:46:02,773
You okay?

1860
01:46:05,026 --> 01:46:06,485
I...

1861
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:10,239
couldn't become your cat, Suzume.

1862
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:13,284
Return me...

1863
