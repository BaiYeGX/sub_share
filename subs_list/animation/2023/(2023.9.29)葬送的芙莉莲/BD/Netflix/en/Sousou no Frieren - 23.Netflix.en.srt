00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,711
NORTHERN LANDS, RUINS OF THE KING'S TOMB

2
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:09,550
Eighteen of you have
passed the first stage of the exam.

3
00:00:10,343 --> 00:00:13,054
{\an8}First of all, congratulations on passing.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,807
I've been told that there is all sorts of

5
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,392
speculation going around

6
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:21,812
about the exams which I oversee,
based on past results.

7
00:00:23,981 --> 00:00:27,360
I'm sure some of you have
heard of the rumors.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,154
But there is no need to be nervous.

9
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,282
The exam is very simple.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,785
Those aiming to become a first-class mage

11
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:38,245
should be able to pass it with ease.

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,290
Now then,

13
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,959
here are the details of the second stage.

14
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:49,298
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

15
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:21,724
The second stage will be a dungeon raid.

16
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:25,978
I will have you raid
the Ruins of the King's Tomb.

17
00:02:27,855 --> 00:02:30,066
There is only one condition to pass.

18
00:02:30,566 --> 00:02:33,861
It's to reach the deepest chamber
of the Ruins of the King's Tomb.

19
00:02:35,404 --> 00:02:37,323
I am a pacifist.

20
00:02:37,823 --> 00:02:39,700
So I don't like fighting.

21
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:43,370
Therefore, all of those who reach
the goal will pass the exam.

22
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,663
Wait a minute.

23
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:48,709
Many adventurers have entered here
and not come out alive.

24
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,127
It's an uncharted dungeon.

25
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:53,172
Do you not want anyone to pass again?

26
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:54,381
What are you saying?

27
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:59,261
All of you are aiming to become
the highest rank of mages.

28
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:03,641
First-class mages
make the impossible possible.

29
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,769
Whether it is uncharted or unprecedented,

30
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:08,938
you must conquer it and move forward.

31
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:12,691
How are we supposed to
prove that we made it

32
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,819
to the deepest chamber?

33
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,863
Should we bring back
some sort of treasure?

34
00:03:18,572 --> 00:03:20,491
You do not have to prove it.

35
00:03:20,991 --> 00:03:23,494
I will go down there too.

36
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:26,956
Of course,
I won't help any of the examinees.

37
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:32,086
One more thing.
I will give each of you this bottle.

38
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:36,882
It's an evacuation golem developed by

39
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,260
the first-class mage Lernen.

40
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,513
When you break the bottle,
a golem will appear

41
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:45,599
and carry you out of the dungeon.

42
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:49,436
It's still a prototype,
but it's safe enough.

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,231
If used, the user will be disqualified,

44
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:56,485
but don't hesitate to use it if you are
wounded and cannot continue with the exam.

45
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,573
Letting up-and-coming mages die here
is not permissible.

46
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,993
Also, at dawn tomorrow,

47
00:04:04,076 --> 00:04:06,537
the bottle will break automatically.

48
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,915
That's the time limit
for the second stage.

49
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:14,420
Well then, the exam begins now.

50
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:38,235
There are multiple entrances.

51
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,363
It seems to be a dungeon
from the Unified Dynasty era.

52
00:04:41,989 --> 00:04:45,701
Dungeons from that era
have multiple entrances,

53
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:48,495
but all of them lead to
the innermost depths.

54
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,581
If we examine each entrance,

55
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,626
we will get a gist of its inner workings
to some extent.

56
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:56,128
We can all split up and--

57
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,881
Why are you talking as if
we're all going to cooperate?

58
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,890
There is nothing to fight over
in this stage of the exam.

59
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:11,143
It's better for all of us
to work together.

60
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,395
That's not possible.

61
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,524
Unlike the first stage, our teammates

62
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,902
don't have to be alive to pass.

63
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,405
Even if we band together,
there's no obligation to help each other

64
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,534
and there's even a risk
of becoming a sacrificial pawn.

65
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:31,872
Especially since
you seem to be knowledgeable in dungeons.

66
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:35,250
I'm going alone.

67
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:52,142
Well, the first stage
sure complicated our relationships.

68
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,771
It'll be hard to team up with
people you don't know.

69
00:05:59,191 --> 00:06:00,359
Let's go.

70
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,446
Hey, wait.

71
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,368
Idiots.

72
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,539
How do they not see
the advantages of cooperating?

73
00:06:14,581 --> 00:06:15,874
Let's go, Fern.

74
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,419
Are you sure, Mistress Frieren?

75
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,838
We can't cooperate.

76
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:23,048
It's not possible anymore.

77
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:29,805
Hmm…

78
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:34,018
Well then, I will follow you two.

79
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,981
I believe you two will be the safest ones
to follow to the innermost depths.

80
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,900
Don't get in our way.

81
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,946
I will not get in your way nor help you.

82
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,290
This is the safest route.

83
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:01,253
Let's move forward with caution
while mapping it out.

84
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,225
The floor right there

85
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,394
is a trap, so be careful.

86
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,904
As always, you are
so knowledgeable about dungeons.

87
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:30,199
I wasn't always like this though.

88
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,994
Himmel liked dungeons.

89
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:38,040
So we did a lot of dungeon raids
and took down monsters.

90
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:42,419
He liked dungeons?
What do you mean by that?

91
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,922
Exactly what it sounds like.

92
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,674
According to him, they're exciting.

93
00:07:48,258 --> 00:07:50,052
It's baffling, isn't it?

94
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,683
These stairs lead to the next level.

95
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,522
I see. I guess this was the wrong route.

96
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,191
Let's go back to that fork from earlier.

97
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:06,193
Let's do that.

98
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:08,445
But why?

99
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,865
Our goal is to find the monster
in the deepest chamber.

100
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:15,077
When will you learn, Eisen?

101
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,581
In dungeons, you have to explore
every corner of a level

102
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,708
before moving on to the next.

103
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,585
That's common sense among adventurers.

104
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,170
No, it's not.

105
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:29,216
You must be thinking, "How foolish."

106
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,887
If you can have fun while helping others,

107
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,431
isn't that the best?

108
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,267
You can't be like this forever.

109
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,061
Dungeons will become more dangerous
down the road.

110
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,354
That's right.

111
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,023
I'll have fun until the end.

112
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:48,610
I'll enjoy my adventures,
explore dungeons,

113
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,613
defeat monsters, find treasures,

114
00:08:52,239 --> 00:08:54,616
and realize later
that I've saved the world.

115
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,370
That's the kind of journey I wish for.

116
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,206
Plus…

117
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:06,628
that fork may lead to a rare grimoire.

118
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,423
What are you doing?
Let's hurry up and go back.

119
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:10,716
What…

120
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:14,553
It's really baffling, isn't it?

121
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,068
Kanne, let's go.

122
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:46,084
In the end, only five stayed behind.

123
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:50,547
If we all cooperated
and divided up the work, it would've been

124
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,342
more than possible
to successfully raid the dungeon.

125
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,096
We had enough talented people
to make that possible.

126
00:09:58,972 --> 00:10:02,851
Denken, not everybody
can think logically like you.

127
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,314
Remember what you said
at the end of the first stage?

128
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,611
They're just irritated, that's all.

129
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:15,614
The smarter ones stayed behind.

130
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,491
Just think of it that way.

131
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,118
At least we don't have any

132
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:24,623
stupid people who would fall for a simple
trap like a mimic and slow us down.

133
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:27,292
Isn't that good enough, Denken?

134
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:31,588
Someone as stupid as that
wouldn't be taking this exam.

135
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,216
Let's go.

136
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,185
This mana…

137
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:47,729
It might be a grimoire.

138
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,401
Mistress Frieren, didn't you see
the results from Mikheit?

139
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,112
It's a mimic.

140
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,823
Fern,

141
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:01,285
the accuracy rate for that spell is 99%.

142
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:03,287
What are you trying to say?

143
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,914
Many historic discoveries

144
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,917
were made because of great mages who

145
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,211
saw through the remaining 1%.

146
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,218
As I expected.

147
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,514
There is a precious grimoire in here.

148
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:27,519
My experience as a mage is telling me so.

149
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,778
It's dark! I'm scared!

150
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,698
So dark! So scary!

151
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:42,701
It's dark! I'm scared!

152
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:59,426
Maybe I chose the wrong people to follow.

153
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,396
Don't step on the floor in the middle.

154
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,273
The ceiling will come falling down.

155
00:12:17,152 --> 00:12:19,946
Don't tell me that stain
shaped like a human is…

156
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,658
How brutal.
It doesn't even leave behind any bones?

157
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:46,431
They're gargoyles!

158
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,908
Denken, one person got trapped inside.

159
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:47,826
I know.

160
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:49,661
She's behind that wall.

161
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,165
Stand back.

162
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,673
It didn't work, huh?

163
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,427
We've no choice. Break the bottle!

164
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,528
Wow…

165
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:26,198
One person is out of the game already.

166
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,704
Letting your guard down for a second
can kill you.

167
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,250
So this is
the Ruins of the King's Tomb, huh?

168
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:50,597
Hey, Fern. Hang on a minute.

169
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:54,100
Can you stop pulling for a second?
I'm going to tear apart.

170
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:56,061
Okay.

171
00:14:57,437 --> 00:14:59,064
<i>In these situations,</i>

172
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:00,774
<i>you actually have to push.</i>

173
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:03,944
<i>Then the mimic will gag and stop biting.</i>

174
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,739
<i>What is it, a dog?</i>

175
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,994
You saved me.

176
00:15:14,287 --> 00:15:15,372
My goodness…

177
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:19,000
How were you getting by
when you were alone?

178
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,337
I would make it explode from inside
using offensive magic.

179
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:26,925
But I don't like doing that
because my hair gets fried.

180
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:27,884
I'm back.

181
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,012
My hair turned into ringlets…

182
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,640
<i>So that's the reason why your hairstyle</i>

183
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,892
<i>would change from time to time?</i>

184
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:36,852
Why?

185
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:39,938
All right, back to business.

186
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,816
Let's continue our raid.

187
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:51,950
They're gargoyles.

188
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,536
Let's take them down before they move.

189
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,332
This medal

190
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,877
is all over the place.

191
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,838
Apparently,
some dilettante is collecting these.

192
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:12,637
This seems like the correct route,
so let's go back.

193
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,680
Why?

194
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:19,811
It's going surprisingly smoothly.

195
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:24,024
Yeah, that's strange
for an uncharted dungeon.

196
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:27,652
Especially since we should be near
the deepest chamber by now.

197
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,197
Either way, we can't let our guard down.

198
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:34,910
Let's take a break
once we find the next burial chamber.

199
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,665
I found some great items.

200
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,709
They look like useless junk to me.

201
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,711
Hmm…

202
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:49,841
I don't understand.

203
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,718
I know, right?

204
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:54,930
Why do those things make her so happy?

205
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,224
She's rubbing her cheek against it…

206
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,188
Fern, you are the one I can't understand.

207
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:08,526
I've never seen a mage as skilled as you
at your age.

208
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:11,404
I'm sure you went through
intense training.

209
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:15,700
But I don't detect
any passion or obsession from you.

210
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,202
You're a strange girl.

211
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,042
I became a full-fledged mage
in order to repay

212
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:26,294
the kindness of a certain person.

213
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,300
<i>At the time, it was my goal in life.</i>

214
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,427
<i>I gave it my all.</i>

215
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,598
<i>I never even thought about</i>
<i>what I would do after that.</i>

216
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,268
I probably

217
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,854
used up all of my passion

218
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,940
and obsession during that time.

219
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,193
Then why do you

220
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:52,445
continue to explore magic?

221
00:17:55,865 --> 00:17:58,535
Doesn't Mistress Frieren look like
she's having fun?

222
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:00,036
She does.

223
00:18:01,204 --> 00:18:04,040
The first time I explored a dungeon,

224
00:18:04,874 --> 00:18:08,461
Mistress Frieren was collecting
magical items that looked like junk

225
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,296
and was smiling so happily.

226
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,013
I couldn't help but smile too.

227
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,140
I think

228
00:18:20,223 --> 00:18:22,767
I am pursuing magic with Mistress Frieren

229
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,146
because I like seeing her like that.

230
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,985
I think it's time to move on.

231
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,410
I made the right choice
in following you two, after all.

232
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,787
I am sure you two

233
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:46,207
will be able to have fun
in this merciless dungeon.

234
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:12,275
The atmosphere has changed.

235
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,445
We might be near the innermost depths.

236
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:19,741
Wirbel.

237
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,659
What? You can't walk anymore--

238
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,369
I'm restrained.

239
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,247
There are three mages
who are hiding their mana.

240
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,415
We were ambushed.

241
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:28,875
Really?

242
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,173
Scharf, block their vision.

243
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:37,342
The spell they used on Ehre is Sorganeil.

244
00:19:38,009 --> 00:19:38,843
I know.

245
00:19:54,609 --> 00:19:58,404
No wonder the Ruin of the King‘s Tomb
was impregnable.

246
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:04,119
Who knew we'd run into
something like this?

247
00:20:06,037 --> 00:20:09,415
Scharf, you target me.
Ehre, you target Scharf.

248
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,751
I will attack Ehre.

249
00:20:13,628 --> 00:20:15,004
We'll get past this.

250
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,840
It's a clone made from magic.

251
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,385
A demon or a monster must be behind this.

252
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:07,724
But I've never seen anyone
clone another being so perfectly.

253
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:12,187
It had the same level
of mana and skill as Laufen.

254
00:21:13,229 --> 00:21:14,981
It even copied her behavior.

255
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:18,610
It's possible that they
even took advantage of her memories.

256
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,779
That's a bit unsettling.

257
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:24,115
The only good thing about it

258
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:27,744
is that you can tell that it's fake
at first glance.

259
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,748
At least we don't have to worry
about friendly fire.

260
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,500
If the user of this spell

261
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:38,087
can manipulate multiple clones
at the same time,

262
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,673
it could be very dangerous.

263
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:47,222
Either way, it was a good idea
that we banded together.

264
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:53,603
We have more options
when dealing with these.

265
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,923
Denken, is that something
you can deal with?

266
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:30,139
There's one thing I can say for certain.

267
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:35,687
If this weren't an exam,
I would've already broken my bottle.

268
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,209
<i>All right…</i>

269
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,293
<i>-It's time to call it quits.</i>
<i>-You smell nice.</i>

270
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:23,711
<i>-If we're equally skilled,</i>
<i>-What shall we do?</i>

271
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:24,754
<i>-winning or losing</i>
<i>-That's not funny.</i>

272
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:25,671
<i>-is up to fate.</i>
<i>-Look at my eyes.</i>

273
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,965
<i>-It's not impossible?</i>
<i>-How much time do you need?</i>

274
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,842
<i>"A Perfect Replica."</i>

275
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,843
