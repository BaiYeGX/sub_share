MAIN TITLE

00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,342
<i>I see…</i>

4
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,512
I remember now.

5
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:39,306
It's Frieren.

6
00:01:41,225 --> 00:01:46,230
<i>She greatly helped humans in</i>
<i>their research and analysis of Zoltraak.</i>

7
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:51,068
<i>The mage who has killed</i>
<i>the most demons in history.</i>

8
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,906
<i>Frieren the Slayer.</i>

9
00:01:58,534 --> 00:02:00,911
<i>Another genius that I hate.</i>

{\an8}EPISODE TITLE

11
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,051
You will have to take it easy for a while.

12
00:02:15,134 --> 00:02:16,552
Thanks.

13
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:25,561
Hey!

14
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:27,897
Are you okay?

15
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:32,026
I'm alive thanks to you two.

16
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:33,486
Thank you.

17
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:41,660
I will pardon the incident
with your mage friend.

18
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:43,913
<i>Her judgement was right.</i>

19
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,751
Now Frieren can return to the town.

20
00:02:49,293 --> 00:02:51,128
Let's have her take down Lügner.

21
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:55,966
Mistress Frieren didn't kill the guard.

22
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:59,887
I know. The demon did that.

23
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:04,433
More importantly, did you say that mage
was named Frieren?

24
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,392
Yes.

25
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:09,730
Don't tell me she's the elf mage
who was in the party of heroes…

26
00:03:10,606 --> 00:03:13,526
If that's so,
that was very disrespectful of me.

27
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,655
The Granat family
is indebted to the party of heroes.

28
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:20,199
<i>During my grandfather's days,</i>

29
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:23,452
<i>they drove back an army of demons</i>

30
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,287
<i>that attacked this town.</i>

31
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:29,208
<i>Their opponent then</i>
<i>was also the Sage of Destruction,</i>

32
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,501
<i>Aura the Guillotine.</i>

33
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:36,048
It's been a while, Aura.

34
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:37,967
It sure has.

35
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,053
It's been about 80 years,
hasn't it, Frieren?

36
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:46,892
You're heading to
the town up ahead, right?

37
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,521
I'd appreciate it if you'd turn back.

38
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,815
I don't want to.

39
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,567
Why not?

40
00:04:14,753 --> 00:04:18,007
Because I obviously have the advantage.

41
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,009
I see.

42
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,681
There are more than back then.

43
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:28,726
To think you can control this many…

44
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:30,519
Demons sure have outstanding magic.

45
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,858
Humans can't even dream of reaching
that level with their current technology.

46
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:40,738
But it's an utterly disgusting spell.

47
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:41,655
It's repulsive.

48
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,575
What a rude thing to say.

49
00:04:44,658 --> 00:04:47,119
After all that work
I put in collecting them.

50
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,048
I recognize some of these suits of armor.

51
00:05:00,382 --> 00:05:04,178
Aura, I will have to
kill you here after all.

52
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,517
<i>The Scales of Obedience.</i>

53
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:15,481
Because of that we have not been able
to win against Aura for years.

54
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,567
She uses

55
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,446
a spell that subjugates
and controls her opponents.

56
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:28,118
The Seven Sages of Destruction use spells
that surpass human understanding.

57
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:33,123
<i>Aura puts her soul</i>
<i>and her opponent's soul on the scale</i>

58
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,501
<i>and weighs the difference in mana.</i>

59
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:39,004
<i>Whichever side has greater mana</i>

60
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,466
<i>can subjugate the other</i>
<i>and turn them into a puppet.</i>

61
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:47,930
<i>This spell lasts forever</i>
<i>until their body perishes.</i>

62
00:05:49,723 --> 00:05:52,226
The bigger the risk,
the stronger the spell.

63
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,938
For Aura, who has
tremendous amounts of mana,

64
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,523
it's an invincible spell.

65
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,776
There is no way to counter it?

66
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:06,865
<i>Aura's mana is weighing</i>
<i>one side down at the moment,</i>

67
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,284
<i>but the scale itself is fair.</i>

68
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,747
<i>If a soul with more mana than Aura</i>
<i>gets on the scale,</i>

69
00:06:14,456 --> 00:06:16,458
Aura can be defeated.

70
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,420
However,

71
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:24,383
it's been 500 years since Aura became
one of the Seven Sages of Destruction

72
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:27,386
and that has never happened even once,
or so I've heard.

73
00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:30,889
So there is no countermeasure?

74
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:37,771
There was, actually.

75
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:40,524
<i>Those with strong will</i>

76
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:43,402
<i>were able to resist albeit momentarily.</i>

77
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,406
<i>And such wills of steel</i>

78
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:50,409
<i>are often found in brilliant,</i>
<i>courageous warriors.</i>

79
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,537
But even then it's only momentarily, huh?

80
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:56,665
But it's still a critical flaw.

81
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,918
I'm sure she found their will
to be very bothersome.

82
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:01,670
That's why…

83
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,883
Aura the Guillotine

84
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:09,553
did a very logical procedure
on those under her control.

85
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:12,556
Something very cruel…

86
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:20,481
How do you like it?

87
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:23,275
Isn't my immortal army strong?

88
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:39,166
How surprising.

89
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:43,170
My spell on them has been dispelled.

90
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:46,173
This has never happened before.

91
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,593
Dispelling magic as powerful as this

92
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,930
must use up a great amount of mana.

93
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,183
Why would you
go out of your way to do this?

94
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,314
Last time we fought,
you blasted them away like nothing.

95
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,569
<i>Himmel got mad at me after that.</i>

96
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:12,574
Then there's even less
of a reason for you to do this.

97
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:17,704
-Why is that?
-Himmel is not here anymore.

98
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,209
I see. That's good to hear.

99
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,839
You demons are beasts after all.

100
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,049
Now I can kill you without remorse.

101
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:31,260
All right.

102
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:34,221
I can move a lot better now.

103
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:38,350
Father, this place is safe, right?

104
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,521
Yes. It's not as strong
as the defense barrier,

105
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:45,315
but this church is protected
by a barrier too.

106
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:48,152
Then you can wait here, Graf.

107
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:52,573
What are you planning to do, brat?

108
00:08:52,656 --> 00:08:54,825
Do you think the demons are nice enough

109
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:56,952
to go away while we hide here?

110
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,913
Master Stark, are you serious?

111
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,584
<i>That attack earlier worked</i>
<i>because it was a surprise.</i>

112
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:07,629
<i>In fact,</i>
<i>it wasn't even enough to kill him.</i>

113
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,675
If we'd kept fighting,

114
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:14,261
we would have been killed.

115
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:18,056
Someone has to do this though.

116
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,440
You're right.
Then let's do our best together.

117
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,778
No, you go to the guard station.

118
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:34,364
Help the townspeople evacuate.

119
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,700
Then are you going to…?

120
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,121
Yes…

121
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,206
I will

122
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,751
get on my knees and beg Frieren
to come back.

123
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:48,295
Huh?

124
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:54,343
What? We have no choice
but to have her defeat them!

125
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,722
I guess that is the most practical method.

126
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,730
He said the guards would listen to you
if you show them this.

127
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,107
Okay.

128
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:12,069
I'll leave town right away.

129
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,239
What is it?

130
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:18,200
Your arms are in bad shape.

131
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:21,787
Will you be able to
pass the gate looking like that?

132
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,581
I'm sure it'll be fine.

133
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:28,085
This is normal for a warrior.
Is it that weird?

134
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,964
I've never seen a warrior
walk around town with blood

135
00:10:32,047 --> 00:10:33,465
running down both arms.

136
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:37,469
You're in no position to talk.
Fern, you also…

137
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:43,559
Whose blood is this? It's not mine, right?

138
00:10:46,603 --> 00:10:49,022
Hey! What's wrong?

139
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,195
Master Stark, this blood has mana--

140
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,198
Fern!

141
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:16,675
Unbelievable… Am I dreaming?

142
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:20,178
That's Master's technique.

143
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:27,102
Because you moved, I missed your vitals.

144
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,939
I had no intention of making you suffer.

145
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,154
Why are you surprised?

146
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:41,992
Is it because I am standing here
despite receiving a fatal wound?

147
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,996
Or is it because you were not able
to detect us approaching?

148
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:51,835
Concealing your presence
by controlling your mana

149
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:54,421
is not a talent
that is limited to just you.

150
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:57,507
Any demon can do that.

151
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,764
That being said, I can't possibly agree
that it is appropriate conduct

152
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:05,515
in a fight between mages.

153
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:08,101
You're very talkative.

154
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:10,270
You're not going to kill me?

155
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,817
Since I failed to kill you,
I'll ask a few things while we're here.

156
00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:20,572
Or would you rather die now?

157
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:23,575
Go ahead.

158
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:28,413
<i>Is that boy strong?</i>

159
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,084
<i>He's the apprentice of Eisen the warrior.</i>

160
00:12:32,876 --> 00:12:35,587
<i>I see. How unfortunate.</i>

161
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,381
<i>Poor kid.</i>

162
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,093
<i>He will not experience</i>
<i>a pleasant death with Linie.</i>

163
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:44,846
One more thing.

164
00:12:45,555 --> 00:12:47,140
Where is Frieren?

165
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:51,853
She fled this town.

166
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:56,233
Because you killed the prison guard.

167
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,611
Graf Granat mentioned
something like that too.

168
00:12:59,694 --> 00:13:02,114
Apparently,
killing a guard is a serious crime.

169
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,199
It's the death penalty.

170
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:05,367
Death penalty?

171
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,496
There's no way that woman would
flee just because of that.

172
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,749
She has a strong hatred for demons.

173
00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:18,422
Strong enough to teach her apprentice
the spell to kill demons.

174
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:22,509
<i>Someone like that would not run away.</i>

175
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,387
<i>She must be after something.</i>

176
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:29,433
Is it Mistress Aura?

177
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,313
Please don't move.

178
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:40,193
It seems you have a clue as to where
Mistress Frieren went.

179
00:13:41,194 --> 00:13:42,821
This is pointless.

180
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:46,867
You said you failed to kill me,
but that's a lie, isn't it?

181
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:52,038
<i>You just wanted to</i>
<i>get back at me for that surprise attack.</i>

182
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,333
You're prideful and haughty

183
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:57,377
and do not see us,

184
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,922
or anyone other than Mistress Frieren,
as a threat.

185
00:14:02,215 --> 00:14:05,427
That is why you went as far as
giving me an opening.

186
00:14:07,637 --> 00:14:11,016
At this distance, I can blow a hole
through your heart.

187
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:13,768
Try it.

188
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,897
You'll lose your head before that.

189
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:26,281
Mistress Frieren,

190
00:14:27,282 --> 00:14:29,826
am I being useful to you?

191
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,953
Why do you ask that?

192
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:37,793
I cannot handle magic as perfectly as you.

193
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,713
Well, the amount of time
we've been alive is so different.

194
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:44,800
You'll never be able to catch up to me.

195
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,011
Is that right?

196
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,808
But that is only in terms of
mana and techniques.

197
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,521
You know how I often put you in charge
of fighting monsters?

198
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:00,357
Yes. You pushed it on me
this time as well.

199
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,566
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:05,654
It ends faster when you do it, Fern.

201
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,157
Because your speed at casting spells
is faster than me.

202
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:12,577
Girl,

203
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,832
I have dedicated most of my life to magic.

204
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:19,334
So have I.

205
00:15:33,932 --> 00:15:36,309
<i>What's with her reaction speed?</i>

206
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,062
<i>If I hadn't blocked it out of reflex,</i>

207
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,523
<i>it would've pierced my heart.</i>

208
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,483
You blocked it.

209
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,069
As I thought, your heart is your weakness.

210
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,572
<i>This girl…</i>

211
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,157
I see…

212
00:15:51,908 --> 00:15:55,328
I guess you weren't lying when you said
you've dedicated your life.

213
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,958
Well then, I'll crush you
with everything I've got.

214
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,084
Balterie.

215
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,798
They've begun fighting.

216
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:10,093
That's too bad.

217
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,762
I'm already done.

218
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,932
Maybe I'll watch their fight.

219
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,103
Master Lügner doesn't like it
when I get in his way.

220
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,359
Oh?

221
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:27,986
It's not

222
00:16:28,653 --> 00:16:30,363
over yet.

223
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:34,117
You're pretty tough.
I guess I can have some fun.

224
00:16:37,704 --> 00:16:40,624
<i>In terms of mana, technique, and control,</i>

225
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:42,626
<i>I am considerably superior to her.</i>

226
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,024
<i>You don't even need to compare</i>

227
00:17:06,107 --> 00:17:08,610
<i>to see the difference between us.</i>

228
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,363
<i>The only thing is that she's fast.</i>

229
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,825
<i>She's overpowering me with</i>
<i>her sheer number of moves.</i>

230
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:27,170
<i>Darn that Frieren… What kind of</i>
<i>training did you put this girl through?</i>

231
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,761
<i>Shall I wear her out</i>
<i>and let her exhaust her mana?</i>

232
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,150
<i>That won't work.</i>

233
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,529
<i>This battle will end before that.</i>

234
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,074
<i>I need to find some kind of opening.</i>

235
00:17:57,283 --> 00:18:00,704
Linie, what are you doing?
Get rid of him already!

236
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:10,380
Jeez, you're so bossy.

237
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:12,924
This guy keeps dodging me
and is so persistent.

238
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,238
That fighting style… What is going on?

239
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:37,490
That is Master's technique.

240
00:18:38,116 --> 00:18:40,744
I'm good at reading people's mana.

241
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:46,291
I memorize the way mana flows through
people's bodies as they move.

242
00:18:46,374 --> 00:18:48,585
Then I can copy their movements.

243
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:50,170
Like this.

244
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:17,572
When I saw you fight for the first time
at the mansion, I knew for sure

245
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,075
<i>that you moved the same way</i>

246
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,952
<i>as the strongest warrior in my memory.</i>

247
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,042
What a coincidence.

248
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,294
Fate sure is strange.

249
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,174
Don't tell me…

250
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:39,928
I am copying the movements
of Eisen the warrior.

251
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,890
<i>Are you serious? This is ridiculous.</i>

252
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,771
<i>There's no way I can win…</i>

253
00:19:58,404 --> 00:19:59,948
Finally, he's knocked out.

254
00:20:00,448 --> 00:20:01,574
I have to hurry

255
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,410
or Master Lügner will get mad again.

256
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,873
<i>Knocked out?</i>

257
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,001
<i>I am knocked out?</i>

258
00:20:16,172 --> 00:20:17,507
Stand up, Stark.

259
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:22,512
No matter how battered you are,
you're not allowed to be knocked out.

260
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,766
That's easier said than done.

261
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:29,811
There's no way I can win
against you, Master.

262
00:20:30,478 --> 00:20:31,771
Of course.

263
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,524
I am stronger than you.

264
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:36,609
Well then--

265
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,113
But you haven't lost to me yet.

266
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:42,615
Because you stood back up.

267
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:44,951
What are you saying…

268
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:46,953
Stark,

269
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:50,623
I'll teach you a trick
to winning against a strong opponent.

270
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,084
It's simple.

271
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,921
No matter how many times it takes,
get back up and keep fighting.

272
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,006
The warrior

273
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,759
who is the last one standing
is the winner.

274
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,516
Jeez Master…

275
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,644
Stop pushing your weird logic on me.

276
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,647
Is your brain made out of muscle or what?

277
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,652
You should've just kept snoozing.

278
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,279
You've lost already.

279
00:21:22,363 --> 00:21:23,907
I'm still standing.

280
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:28,036
Plus, I remembered…

281
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,872
Master's attacks had more weight to them.

282
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:35,168
You're just an imitation after all.

283
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,133
Well then, I will end your life

284
00:21:42,717 --> 00:21:44,302
with this "imitation."

285
00:21:45,386 --> 00:21:46,846
Erfassen.

286
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,514
Balterie!

287
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,029
<i>A big swing with no defensive measure.</i>

288
00:22:03,112 --> 00:22:04,614
<i>He must've gone crazy.</i>

289
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,376
I was prepared to die along with you,
but I scared myself for nothing.

290
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:19,254
As I thought,
it has no weight to it at all.

291
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,674
Lightning Strike!

292
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:35,979
Linie!

293
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:38,481
-Darn--
-Zoltraak.

294
00:22:43,486 --> 00:22:46,364
<i>The spell to kill demons…</i>

295
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,542
<i>It's about a fifth of it.</i>

296
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,586
<i>-Of my mana.</i>
<i>-Frieren will lose.</i>

297
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:25,463
<i>-It's nothing compared to me.</i>
<i>-An elf village.</i>

298
00:24:25,546 --> 00:24:27,256
<i>Kill all the elves.</i>

299
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,842
<i>You're a far greater mage than me.</i>

300
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,802
