00:00:03,502 --> 00:00:06,339
I am Mistress Frieren's apprentice.

2
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,217
<i>You pass.</i>

3
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:13,846
<i>Next!</i>

ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

5
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,566
Denken, the Imperial Mage.

6
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,735
I know about you.

7
00:01:51,902 --> 00:01:54,238
I am honored.

8
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,992
You worked your way up
while serving in the military

9
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:02,079
and now you are a mage with
the most authority in the northern lands.

10
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,749
Your inspirational story is famous.

11
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:10,296
Honestly, I wish I had met you
when you were young.

12
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,842
When you were young, hot-blooded,

13
00:02:15,342 --> 00:02:16,719
and full of ambition.

14
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,641
I have no interest in a dying flame.

15
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,688
At least, that's what I thought…

16
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,860
You changed your mind?

17
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:36,739
The moment you saw me, you thought about

18
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,616
how you would fight me, didn't you?

19
00:02:41,243 --> 00:02:45,247
Just for a split second.
I gave up right away.

20
00:02:46,665 --> 00:02:50,002
You pass. Your flame is still burning.

21
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:53,631
Normal people wouldn't even
think about fighting me.

22
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:56,509
Next.

23
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:02,848
You pass.

24
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:06,644
But I haven't said anything yet.

25
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:09,063
Is a conversation necessary?

26
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:12,775
I guess you're right.

27
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:13,818
Next.

28
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:20,074
You must be joking.

29
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:21,116
What do you mean?

30
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:23,536
This is a first-class mage exam, you know?

31
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,747
What kind of idiot doesn't come
to the exam even once?

32
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,918
As you can see,

33
00:03:31,418 --> 00:03:33,921
I am here in the flesh as well,

34
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:35,756
to qualify as a participant--

35
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,092
During this entire exam,

36
00:03:38,175 --> 00:03:40,886
your real body
hasn't left your hometown, has it?

37
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,014
I bet you're leisurely enjoying teatime.

38
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,770
That's surprising.

39
00:03:50,354 --> 00:03:52,106
Even Übel didn't notice.

40
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:56,068
You have quite the audacity. You pass.

41
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:57,570
Next.

42
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,700
You're Wirbel, the captain
of the Northern Magic Corps, right?

43
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,578
Out of all the second-class mages I know,

44
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:07,580
you are the most equipped for combat.

45
00:04:08,914 --> 00:04:10,457
The moment you saw me,

46
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,918
you realized
that you couldn't win against me.

47
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,130
But that conclusion wasn't made
out of fear.

48
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,799
If I was a fool who'd
start an unwinnable fight,

49
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,218
I wouldn't be a second-class mage.

50
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,596
That's true.

51
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,099
Tell me a spell you like.

52
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,352
Magic is a killing tool.

53
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,354
I don't like or hate any of them.

54
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:35,733
You pass.

55
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:37,109
Next.

56
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,658
What did you think when you saw me?

57
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:50,372
Um… I thought you were small and adorable.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,878
What is wrong
with these examinees this year?

59
00:04:56,962 --> 00:04:58,380
You pass.

60
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:05,888
Sense,

61
00:05:07,014 --> 00:05:08,349
I apologize.

62
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:11,393
This year's group
was particularly talented.

63
00:05:15,564 --> 00:05:16,649
I failed…

64
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:17,900
There's always next time.

65
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,402
Stop following me.

66
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:23,239
Three years from now, huh?

67
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:26,659
Mistress Frieren, I passed.

68
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,246
Good job.

69
00:05:31,747 --> 00:05:32,665
Frieren.

70
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,628
We were able to make it this far
thanks to you two.

71
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:42,299
Now I can visit the cemetery
in my hometown.

72
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:44,885
I see.

73
00:05:52,851 --> 00:05:54,311
Come on, Fern.

74
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:55,896
Can you hurry up?

75
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,409
-I'll go with this.
-This one.

76
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,296
Eat as much as you want.

77
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,090
When I was young,

78
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:26,719
I rarely had the chance
to eat sweet things.

79
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:28,762
Thank you very much.

80
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,936
<i>Why am I here?</i>

81
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,150
Eat up, young'un.

82
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,070
Thanks, old man.

83
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,371
Who is he?

84
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,666
He's Master Denken, an Imperial Mage.

85
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,170
An Imperial Mage, huh?

86
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,384
You mean he's a noble?!

87
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:11,680
Um, I'm sorry I spoke to you informally.

88
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,098
It's fine.

89
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,226
I came to this town
as nothing but a regular mage.

90
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,606
But I can't let you treat me,
when I'm a complete stranger.

91
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:23,609
I don't have anything else
to spend my money on.

92
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:26,070
That can't be true.

93
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,364
Yeah, what about your grandchildren?

94
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,369
I don't have any children
or grandchildren.

95
00:07:33,869 --> 00:07:37,373
When I was in my mid-twenties,
my wife died.

96
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,002
She always had health problems.

97
00:07:43,253 --> 00:07:44,838
<i>She was the daughter of a noble from</i>

98
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,467
<i>a remote area in the Northern Plateau,</i>
<i>who lost in a political struggle.</i>

99
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:54,098
<i>At the time, I needed</i>
<i>both wealth and power.</i>

100
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:58,018
<i>Those were the only things</i>
<i>I could think of that could save her.</i>

101
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,814
<i>But Serie established</i>

102
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:04,400
<i>the Continental Magic Association</i>
<i>with the promise</i>

103
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:07,361
<i>of granting people a privilege</i>
<i>shortly after my wife died.</i>

104
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,657
{\an8}<i>I've never felt as helpless as I did then.</i>

105
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,703
It's so ironic.

106
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,874
Now, I have enough power
to move entire nations.

107
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,127
Fern,

108
00:08:23,627 --> 00:08:25,587
to me, magic was nothing but

109
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,424
a tool to use for political strife.

110
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,927
Will you please tell Frieren

111
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,930
that for the first time in a while,
I was reminded

112
00:08:35,013 --> 00:08:37,182
of the fact that magic can be fun.

113
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,854
I became a mage
because I wanted to be like Frieren,

114
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:44,064
the mage in the party of heroes.

115
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,278
Please tell her that yourself.

116
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,947
I'm sure Mistress Frieren
would appreciate that.

117
00:08:53,615 --> 00:08:54,950
That's true.

118
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,952
I'll do that.

119
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:09,548
As expected of Äußerst, the city of magic.

120
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,967
I was able to buy so many great grimoires.

121
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,392
Hey, old lady.

122
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,354
Do they all need to go into this basket?

123
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:29,735
I can't believe you ignored that.

124
00:09:30,235 --> 00:09:32,738
I thought about helping for a second.

125
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:34,114
Just for a second, huh?

126
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:36,492
I'm so surprised.

127
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:39,411
I thought a party member of
Himmel the Hero would be…

128
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,622
A party member of Himmel would be what?

129
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,710
Speaking of being surprised, I was too.

130
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,714
I heard you tried to kill Fern's party
in the first stage.

131
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,758
She was complaining about you.

132
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,928
She said you seem like the type
who'd kick a dog.

133
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,096
I get that often.

134
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,849
I was only trying to scare them.

135
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,060
Although,

136
00:10:03,143 --> 00:10:06,939
<i>I would've done the world a favor</i>
<i>if I had killed one of them.</i>

137
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,861
I will do anything in order
to protect my hometown.

138
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,657
I wanted to become a first-class mage

139
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,077
for the privilege of being granted
a spell of my choice.

140
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,287
If I get a hold of a strong spell,

141
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,873
I'll be able to kill
that many more demons.

142
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:28,877
But even when it has
nothing to do with demons,

143
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:33,173
I try to help anyone
who is in need as much as I can.

144
00:10:33,715 --> 00:10:34,633
Why?

145
00:10:38,136 --> 00:10:40,597
My hometown is
in a remote area in the north.

146
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,477
<i>The people there know</i>
<i>countless stories of Himmel the Hero.</i>

147
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,524
<i>From the conquest</i>
<i>of the Thousand-Mirror Tower</i>

148
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:54,861
<i>to the battles against Böse the Immortal</i>
<i>and the hell emperor dragon.</i>

149
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,700
<i>When I was a kid,</i>
<i>I loved those tales of adventures.</i>

150
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,998
<i>But the older ones in the village</i>
<i>never talked about those stories.</i>

151
00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:10,252
<i>"He took down a monster</i>
<i>who attacked the village."</i>

152
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:12,796
<i>"He escorted a merchant."</i>
<i>Those were their stories.</i>

153
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,508
<i>The worst story was about</i>
<i>how he simply transported goods.</i>

154
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,886
<i>They weren't exciting at all.</i>

155
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,806
<i>"What a boring story."</i>
<i>That's what I thought.</i>

156
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,892
<i>But the older ones in the village</i>

157
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,813
<i>looked so happy as they all</i>
<i>shared stories like that.</i>

158
00:11:32,816 --> 00:11:35,068
<i>After Himmel the Hero died</i>

159
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,405
<i>and the remaining demons began to</i>
<i>run amok, it all made sense.</i>

160
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,208
<i>In reality,</i>

161
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,755
<i>the Thousand-Mirror Tower,</i>
<i>Böse, the hell emperor dragon,</i>

162
00:11:54,838 --> 00:11:58,675
<i>and even the Demon King</i>
<i>were irrelevant to my village.</i>

163
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,597
<i>Everyone had their hands full</i>
<i>just trying to protect their daily lives.</i>

164
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:09,144
If Himmel the Hero
hadn't come to my village,

165
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:13,774
it wouldn't have been around to see
a peaceful world.

166
00:12:14,566 --> 00:12:17,444
I see. What is your point?

167
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:20,072
What brought me to where I am right now

168
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:23,450
is Himmel the Hero's
trivial tales of adventures.

169
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:28,580
That's all I wanted to say.

170
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:33,919
I guess I was talking for too long.

171
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,173
As it turns out, I'm going to
go back with those two.

172
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,888
Frieren, you should cherish
the people you encounter.

173
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:49,142
Death isn't the only thing
that separates people forever.

174
00:12:51,311 --> 00:12:53,647
But I'm sure you're fully aware of that.

175
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,907
Frieren, can't you use magic to

176
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,535
carry them one by one to the other side?

177
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:10,622
Then I'll be left alone on this side.

178
00:13:10,705 --> 00:13:11,998
Himmel,

179
00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:15,877
we can't waste any time
in taking down the Demon King.

180
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:19,756
Why do we have to
do such trivial acts of kindness?

181
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,887
True, it's a trivial act of kindness.

182
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:30,392
Doing things like this
won't change the world, I'm sure.

183
00:13:32,227 --> 00:13:33,520
But I have no intention

184
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:37,107
of ignoring people who are within reach,
when they need help.

185
00:13:48,201 --> 00:13:50,036
Don't worry, Himmel.

186
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:53,957
The world is changing, for sure.

187
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,172
We're going to be
awarded our privilege tonight.

188
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:02,382
Apparently, we can bring companions.

189
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:06,136
So why don't we all go together?

190
00:14:08,805 --> 00:14:11,266
She looks really reluctant.

191
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,188
Um, I was told that I can
bring a companion though.

192
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,732
I'm very sorry.

193
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:22,694
Mistress Serie has informed us
that Mistress Frieren is banned.

194
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,279
She does not want you to enter

195
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:27,949
any Continental Magic Association facility
for another 1000 years.

196
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,204
What did Mistress Frieren do
to deserve this treatment?

197
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:33,830
It can't be helped.

198
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,000
I upset Serie, after all.

199
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,087
She's so childish, isn't she?

200
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,175
Well, it's not like I came here
because I wanted to anyway.

201
00:14:45,258 --> 00:14:46,968
I'll be waiting outside.

202
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:52,390
I'll wait outside too.

203
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,727
Hey!

204
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,364
That's the evening bell.

205
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:10,700
They should be done
awarding the privileges soon.

206
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,160
Yeah.

207
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,995
A first-class mage…

208
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:18,208
The highest rank of mages that less than
50 people in the world claim to be.

209
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:20,919
Fern has come a long way.

210
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:26,800
In this generation,

211
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:31,096
Fern will probably become
a mage more famous than me.

212
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,850
Frieren…

213
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:36,935
Isn't that great?

214
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,730
Yeah, it is.

215
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,607
Mistress Frieren.

216
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,361
Who is that?

217
00:15:46,444 --> 00:15:48,738
Someone from
the Continental Magic Association.

218
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,117
I am Lernen, a first-class mage.

219
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,995
I'm one of Mistress Serie's apprentices.

220
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,999
It seems that Mistress Serie
has caused you trouble.

221
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:00,876
It's fine.

222
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,003
She's always been this way.

223
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,757
What's wrong, Frieren?

224
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,053
You see it, don't you?

225
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,972
The instability of my mana.

226
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:17,976
You're extremely skilled.

227
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:20,812
Which is surprising to see
in an era of peace.

228
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,272
I agree.

229
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:26,985
I am an outdated mage
who only knows how to fight.

230
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:29,988
Mistress Serie tells me all the time,

231
00:16:30,071 --> 00:16:33,325
that if I was born during
the war against the Demon King's army,

232
00:16:33,408 --> 00:16:35,577
I would have gone down in history

233
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,580
along with other famous heroes.

234
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,001
I see. So what do you want from me?

235
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,712
Among Mistress Serie's apprentices,

236
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:47,839
the only one who has gone down in history

237
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:52,385
is the Great Mage Flamme,
who is now treated like a mythical being.

238
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,179
If I die of old age,

239
00:16:54,262 --> 00:16:59,225
Mistress Serie will lose one more
testament to her existence.

240
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:02,312
I don't want to leave her

241
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:04,981
all alone, with nothing in the future.

242
00:17:05,815 --> 00:17:08,526
I want to leave her with something,

243
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,781
even if that is the notoriety of killing
Mistress Frieren, the legendary mage.

244
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:33,301
I challenge you to a duel,
Mistress Frieren.

245
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:37,597
I will not duel you. It's a waste of time.

246
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:39,849
Jeez…

247
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,644
Mages who only know how to fight

248
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:45,146
are never good at
communicating their feelings.

249
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:48,984
There's no need to go down in history.

250
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:53,697
Serie will remember.

251
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,744
One more thing before I go…

252
00:18:01,037 --> 00:18:04,332
This flower garden was made using magic.

253
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,002
What about that?

254
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,296
It was Master's favorite spell.

255
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,758
Didn't you call it a "stupid spell"?

256
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:20,640
Honestly, Flamme was a failure.

257
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:24,269
Despite having as much talent as she did,

258
00:18:24,352 --> 00:18:26,980
she couldn't reach my level.

259
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:31,818
After her, I took in lots of apprentices.

260
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,740
Almost all of them died before me,
without coming even close to my level.

261
00:18:37,907 --> 00:18:39,659
But it's strange.

262
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:42,787
<i>Even though I took them in on a whim,</i>

263
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:45,707
<i>I can clearly remember each of their</i>

264
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,293
<i>personalities and their favorite spells.</i>

265
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:54,090
Frieren, for some reason,
I've never regretted

266
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,843
taking an apprentice even once.

267
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,513
Even if they weren't able to
go down in history.

268
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:06,603
She can't even express
her honest feelings to her apprentice.

269
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,731
She's really such a child.

270
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:15,945
Mistress Frieren.

271
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:19,783
They've finished awarding privileges.

272
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:20,950
Then let's go.

273
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,954
Mistress Frieren,
what happened to your shoulder?

274
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,832
I need to get it healed at the church.

275
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,459
I hope they're open.

276
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,463
We really are bad at communicating.

277
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:39,219
You and I both.

278
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,558
Stark, what kind of game
do you want to play today?

279
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:48,728
Sorry, I can't play with you guys today.

280
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,481
Stark, did you eat breakfast?

281
00:19:51,564 --> 00:19:52,857
I already did.

282
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,735
Stark, come and have a drink.

283
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,237
Oh, thanks!

284
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:01,533
The path to strength
is complex and dangerous.

285
00:20:01,616 --> 00:20:02,992
I wish you well.

286
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,495
Thanks.

287
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:11,251
It's time to say goodbye to Äußerst.

288
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,171
Stark, everyone seems to love you
wherever you go.

289
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,881
You think so?

290
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:21,261
By the way, what kind of spell
did you receive yesterday?

291
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,269
Can't you tell?

292
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,481
Your clothes are clean.

293
00:20:35,316 --> 00:20:38,111
And have a floral scent.

294
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:40,280
Don't tell me…

295
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:44,534
It's the spell to make
clothes clean and spotless.

296
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,995
This will make doing laundry so easy.

297
00:20:47,495 --> 00:20:50,290
Serie lives up to her name
as the living grimoire.

298
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,044
That's a legendary spell that is said to
have existed in mythical times.

299
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,173
Way to go, Fern.

300
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,135
You truly are my apprentice.

301
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,974
Of course, I am, Mistress Frieren.

302
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:12,520
<i>Mistress Serie</i>
<i>looked very reluctant though.</i>

303
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,689
You must be insane.

304
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,942
I can imagine. Serves her right.

305
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,198
Oh, she's here.

306
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:25,825
Frieren!

307
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,952
Thanks for everything.

308
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,080
We failed this time,

309
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,458
but we'll try again in three years.

310
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,960
Yeah? I'm glad.

311
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,713
-It was fun.
-Take care.

312
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:42,133
-See you.
-Yeah, see you.

313
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,314
It's just like the time with Sein.

314
00:21:56,397 --> 00:21:58,483
You part ways with people so easily.

315
00:21:58,566 --> 00:22:00,235
She was this way with Kraft too.

316
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:11,746
Himmel,

317
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,291
you part ways with people
so easily, don't you?

318
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:16,751
Is that weird?

319
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,213
Well, knowing you, it's surprising.

320
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:24,008
Even if it was just a job, we did
travel together for two weeks, after all.

321
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,761
Plus, he drank with us

322
00:22:26,844 --> 00:22:28,805
almost every night and was so--

323
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:29,764
You corrupt priest…

324
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,016
I guess so.

325
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:36,938
But as long as our journey continues,
we can always meet again.

326
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:41,776
Tearful goodbyes don't suit us.

327
00:22:47,073 --> 00:22:50,827
After all,
it'll be embarrassing when we meet again.

328
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:08,613
It'll be embarrassing when we meet again.

329
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:10,323
-Huh?
-Huh?

330
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:13,076
What do you mean?

331
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,211
