1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:05,171
If anyone can kill you,

2
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:06,923
it's the Demon King

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,677
or a human mage.

00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,266
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

5
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:56,967
She blocked it.

6
00:03:00,596 --> 00:03:02,723
Not surprising.

7
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:05,226
From here it will be

8
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,187
a battle of attrition.

9
00:03:14,443 --> 00:03:15,945
They really were here.

10
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:18,614
It's just as Methode detected.

11
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,617
Don't get in my way.

12
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,078
Right back at you.

13
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:31,335
<i>Methode figured out the exact locations</i>
<i>of our enemies.</i>

14
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,839
If it turns into a melee,
we have no chance of winning.

15
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,551
Let's split up and stop the clones

16
00:03:38,634 --> 00:03:40,845
before they assemble here.

17
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,223
We've told each other
who our toughest opponents would be.

18
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:46,851
If it's a tough opponent for you,

19
00:03:46,934 --> 00:03:49,728
it should be a tough opponent
for your clone as well.

20
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,274
In terms of
being able to communicate and cooperate,

21
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:55,442
we have an advantage.

22
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:02,783
<i>If we choose who we fight wisely,</i>

23
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:06,912
<i>we can have the upper hand to some extent.</i>

24
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,673
<i>If you can't defeat them alone,</i>

25
00:04:18,507 --> 00:04:19,967
<i>try to outnumber them.</i>

26
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,528
<i>It's almost funny</i>
<i>how easy it is to fight her.</i>

27
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:50,039
<i>If we keep this up,</i>
<i>we can stop the clones.</i>

28
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:00,674
Okay, let's go according to plan.

29
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,135
All right. I wish you good luck.

30
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:07,389
There's one concern.

31
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,809
The total number of clones I can detect

32
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,395
is less than the number of examinees.

33
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:14,897
And what's more,

34
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,401
I cannot detect our biggest threat,
which is Sense's clone.

35
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,529
You're right, I can't detect it either.

36
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:26,158
{\an8}We can't overlook the existence
of Sense's clone.

37
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:30,162
If we get caught in crossfire,
I won't be able to protect Fern.

38
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,873
Worst-case scenario, we both may die.

39
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:38,379
I'm not able to detect the locations
of Fern and Denken's clones either.

40
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:42,216
We have no choice but to use
more accurate close-range detection.

41
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:46,261
{\an8}If you weren't here,

42
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:48,514
{\an8}we wouldn't have to worry about this.

43
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,643
First-class mages must be able to

44
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:55,771
overcome even the most absurd adversities.

45
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:58,774
This doesn't even count as adversity.

46
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:04,279
{\an8}Plus, you get to pass the exam
just by covering each other's backs.

47
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:08,409
It is such an easy, peaceful exam.

48
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,711
We defeated it.

49
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,964
But it's not the greatest feeling.

50
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,261
<i>A surprise attack?</i>

51
00:06:34,768 --> 00:06:35,728
What a monster…

52
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:39,606
I don't remember stopping
my mana detection.

53
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:44,653
Lawine, you should break your bottle too.

54
00:06:46,822 --> 00:06:49,116
You're mature enough
to know your limits, aren't you?

55
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,994
There will be another exam in three years.

56
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:54,913
Damn it!

57
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:03,547
<i>I didn't make it in time, huh?</i>

58
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:07,551
<i>But the outcome</i>
<i>wouldn't have been any different</i>

59
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:09,553
<i>even if I had assisted them.</i>

60
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,351
<i>Even while her back is facing me,</i>
<i>I don't see any window of opportunity.</i>

61
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:20,147
<i>In any case,</i>
<i>I still need to at least buy some time.</i>

62
00:07:21,982 --> 00:07:25,694
Aren't you Denken, the Imperial Mage?

63
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,739
What's the situation?

64
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,493
Are you planning on fighting that thing?

65
00:07:32,576 --> 00:07:34,078
I don't think you will win.

66
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,580
I am aware of that.

67
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:42,044
Hey, Denken, is this a necessary step
in raiding the dungeon?

68
00:07:42,544 --> 00:07:43,962
Right now, Frieren is--

69
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:47,841
I don't need an explanation.
Is this a necessary step or not?

70
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,220
It is.

71
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,973
Then I'll defeat it.

72
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,101
What are you talking about?

73
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:59,686
Denken is the strongest among us.

74
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,107
And first of all,
you couldn't even win against Wirbel.

75
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:07,111
That's not what this is about, though.

76
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:11,073
Indeed, I am
an inexperienced third-class mage.

77
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:14,451
I am substantially weaker
than Denken and Wirbel.

78
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,372
But I'm pretty sure I can win
against Sense.

79
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,875
This is the spell I specialize in.

80
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,630
Reelseiden, a spell that can cut through
pretty much anything.

81
00:08:26,713 --> 00:08:30,134
It will cut through anything
that I deem cuttable.

82
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:33,387
And it will not cut anything
that I deem uncuttable.

83
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:35,806
So what?

84
00:08:36,306 --> 00:08:39,017
Defensive magic
can easily block that spell.

85
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,311
Oh, that's right,

86
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:44,273
you were watching me fight Wirbel.

87
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,986
Well, defensive magic
is made to block magic, after all.

88
00:08:49,653 --> 00:08:52,531
I can't really visualize myself
cutting through it.

89
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:53,949
Is that right?

90
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:57,077
Then it won't work
against Sense either way.

91
00:08:57,786 --> 00:09:00,414
Just from what I can detect,
that hair is covered

92
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:04,251
with multiple layers of magic
that work like defensive magic.

93
00:09:04,918 --> 00:09:07,963
Like I said,
I don't care about all that logical stuff.

94
00:09:08,046 --> 00:09:10,674
It's all about visualizing.

95
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,509
Hey, wait.

96
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:20,267
As I thought, Sorganeil won't work.

97
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,313
Hair is part of the body, after all.

98
00:09:24,396 --> 00:09:26,773
It's impossible to keep
her entire body within sight.

99
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:30,777
Reelseiden.

100
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,533
<i>As expected,</i>
<i>Übel is the one fighting my clone, huh?</i>

101
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,411
<i>I already know the outcome.</i>

102
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,414
<i>It probably won't even</i>
<i>escalate into a battle.</i>

103
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,920
<i>That was two years ago,</i>
<i>during the second-class mage exam…</i>

104
00:09:48,003 --> 00:09:51,507
<i>The proctor assigned</i>
<i>to the second stage of the exam</i>

105
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,800
<i>was Burg, a first-class mage.</i>

106
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:57,471
<i>Since the time he became</i>
<i>a first-class mage,</i>

107
00:09:57,554 --> 00:10:00,641
<i>he had never once suffered</i>
<i>a single wound during battle.</i>

108
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:03,560
<i>He was a mage who specialized</i>
<i>in defensive magic.</i>

109
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,021
<i>The Immovable Cloak.</i>

110
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,899
<i>It's a cloak he made from magic</i>

111
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:13,695
<i>that was embedded with defensive spells</i>
<i>that repelled all offensive magic.</i>

112
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:17,157
<i>For the second stage of the exam,</i>

113
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:21,578
<i>the examinees were to aim offensive magic</i>
<i>at the cloaked Burg,</i>

114
00:10:22,162 --> 00:10:26,333
<i>and they simply had to make him</i>
<i>take a step back to pass.</i>

115
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,836
<i>The rule prohibiting the act of killing</i>

116
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,714
<i>was only there to keep</i>
<i>their offensive magic</i>

117
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,176
<i>under control for the safety</i>
<i>of the other examinees.</i>

118
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,219
Next.

119
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,394
<i>Nobody was worried about Burg's safety.</i>

120
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,739
I cut too much.

121
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:05,497
<i>But a nameless girl who was</i>
<i>a newly appointed third-class mage</i>

122
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:08,750
<i>killed him like it was nothing.</i>

123
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,923
I'm disqualified, aren't I? I know.

124
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,175
Can I go home now?

125
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,594
I just have one question.

126
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:21,221
Go ahead.

127
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,891
How were you able to
break through the Immovable Cloak?

128
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:32,065
Um, have you ever done any sewing, Sense?

129
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:34,234
No. What about it?

130
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,696
I thought so.
You look like your family is well-off.

131
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:41,491
Or maybe you use magic
to take care of all that stuff?

132
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:43,869
Well, you know,

133
00:11:43,952 --> 00:11:47,998
I'm clumsy, so I've never
done it myself either.

134
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:55,839
<i>But I used to watch</i>
<i>my older sister sew all the time.</i>

135
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:02,471
When you cut the fabric,

136
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:07,309
you place the scissors like this
and slice it in one sweep.

137
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,854
It makes a wonderful sound.

138
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,402
I loved that sound.

139
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:19,863
Where are you going with this?

140
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,240
I'm talking about visualization.

141
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,328
Fabrics are made to be cut.

142
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,580
It's only natural to cut them.

143
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,417
<i>She is crazy.</i>

144
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:36,588
<i>It's true that anyone can visualize</i>
<i>themselves cutting fabric.</i>

145
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,715
<i>Even a fool can do that.</i>

146
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,928
<i>But the world of magic isn't that easy.</i>

147
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,058
<i>If you cannot perfectly visualize it,</i>
<i>you cannot actualize it with magic.</i>

148
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:54,439
<i>Just as a tiny ant can't visualize</i>
<i>itself stomping on a huge dragon,</i>

149
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,401
<i>hardly any mage could visualize</i>

150
00:12:57,484 --> 00:13:00,487
<i>themselves cutting that cloak,</i>
<i>which was protected by</i>

151
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,489
<i>impenetrable defensive spells.</i>

152
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:08,370
<i>That's because any mage could tell</i>
<i>at first glance that the cloak</i>

153
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:11,415
<i>could repel any kind of offensive magic.</i>

154
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:13,834
<i>Even a fool could understand.</i>

155
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:18,672
<i>So long as humans</i>
<i>are intelligent life forms,</i>

156
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:21,508
<i>we cannot break free</i>
<i>from those mental constraints.</i>

157
00:13:22,884 --> 00:13:26,263
<i>And yet, she still followed her intuition.</i>

158
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:31,184
<i>Intellectually,</i>
<i>she knew it was uncuttable.</i>

159
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:35,605
<i>But she trusted her intuition</i>
<i>and visualized herself cutting the cloak.</i>

160
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,944
<i>Her mental state cannot be</i>
<i>that of a normal human being.</i>

161
00:13:41,903 --> 00:13:44,156
<i>It's a gift, at this point.</i>

162
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:47,742
Can I leave now?

163
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:48,952
Sure.

164
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:54,166
By the way, Sense,
you have such beautiful hair.

165
00:13:54,249 --> 00:13:56,918
Maintaining it must be a lot of work.

166
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:04,718
<i>Perhaps I had already lost at that moment.</i>

167
00:14:05,385 --> 00:14:08,013
<i>I cannot visualize myself</i>
<i>winning against Übel.</i>

168
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:10,724
<i>We are just too incompatible.</i>

169
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,025
Everyone needs to stop
overcomplicating things.

170
00:14:20,108 --> 00:14:22,068
Hair is meant to be cut, isn't it?

171
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:26,072
<i>Maintaining my hair?</i>

172
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:27,574
It's a hellish process.

173
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,368
I don't even want to think about it.

174
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,248
She should just cut it.

175
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,337
I see what's going on now.

176
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:44,132
So all of you are buying time until

177
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,468
Frieren defeats Spiegel, huh?

178
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,178
Yes, that's right.

179
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:51,890
We already took out
three clones ourselves.

180
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:54,100
Then that saves us time.

181
00:14:54,726 --> 00:14:57,229
Well then… Oh, my…

182
00:14:57,312 --> 00:15:01,900
It seems
Sense's clone was defeated just now.

183
00:15:01,983 --> 00:15:03,610
This mana belongs to…

184
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:07,113
It was Übel, the third-class mage,
who defeated it.

185
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:09,699
That's surprising.

186
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,286
Is it? They seem pretty incompatible.

187
00:15:14,037 --> 00:15:18,166
Battles between mages are a bit like
playing rock, paper, scissors.

188
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,877
Although it's a complex
and difficult version

189
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,880
of rock, paper, scissors,
with countless possibilities.

190
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:28,468
And now you want to expand
the possibilities even more, huh?

191
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,724
All right, I'll help you
in holding back the clones.

192
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,770
I'm not the type to trust others,

193
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,731
but I'm not stupid enough to
waste an opportunity.

194
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,903
At the moment,
there are two high-risk clones that

195
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,989
we must stop at all costs.

196
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:51,324
I have located

197
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,619
one of the two, which is Denken's clone.

198
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,497
I will leave that one up to you three.

199
00:15:59,624 --> 00:16:03,044
In regard to the other one,
which is Fern's clone,

200
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,754
you can leave that up to me.

201
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,134
It seems she is especially good
at concealing her mana.

202
00:16:09,634 --> 00:16:11,636
Unless I find her, we may suffer

203
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,638
casualties from surprise attacks.

204
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,433
Can you really handle her alone?

205
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,186
I can concentrate on mana detection
better when I'm alone.

206
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,772
That girl is pretty strong, you know?

207
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:27,402
I'm versatile, so stalling people
is what I excel at.

208
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:32,407
-Plus, I tested my restraining spell.
-There!

209
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:35,285
-Made sure it worked on her.
-I can't move.

210
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:40,290
All right then, let's get this started.

211
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:44,544
Übel, this isn't

212
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:47,213
my imagination, is it?

213
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,174
I don't think so.

214
00:16:49,257 --> 00:16:52,135
After all, you can't move, right?

215
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,308
My clone has reemerged.

216
00:17:04,731 --> 00:17:06,691
Is this perhaps going to

217
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,819
continue until that Spiegel
or whatever is defeated?

218
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:13,657
It's a battle of attrition.
This is getting exciting!

219
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,326
Indeed…

220
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,329
{\an8}Now is the time to call it quits.

221
00:17:58,076 --> 00:17:59,744
<i>This opening won't work either.</i>

222
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,747
<i>Fern isn't able to notice it yet.</i>

223
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,002
<i>I'm left with no other choice.</i>

224
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:10,505
The opening created
after my mana detection is

225
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:13,008
interrupted won't be enough
to kill the clone.

226
00:18:13,508 --> 00:18:14,718
I agree.

227
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:18,430
If only there was a bigger opening,
we could win…

228
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,098
You think you can win?

229
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,518
Then I will create an opening.

230
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,271
You can do such a thing?

231
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:28,064
The moment I become vulnerable,

232
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,775
the clone will be even more vulnerable.

233
00:18:32,485 --> 00:18:34,821
But that means you will be…

234
00:18:34,904 --> 00:18:38,283
If I focus on my defense,
nothing will become fatal.

235
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,120
What's the plan in that case?

236
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,584
I'll leave that up to you.

237
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,462
If you think you can win, you will win.

238
00:18:51,087 --> 00:18:53,089
How can you be so sure?

239
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,844
Because I always underestimate you, Fern.

240
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:03,975
That's good.

241
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,436
We have a chance of winning then.

242
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,368
<i>It's still standing…</i>

243
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,745
<i>But it's critically wounded.</i>

244
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,080
<i>Let's end this…</i>

245
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:16,965
<i>What just happened?</i>

246
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:18,800
<i>Was I attacked?</i>

247
00:20:19,592 --> 00:20:21,594
<i>I don't sense any mana at all.</i>

248
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:26,057
<i>My body isn't</i>
<i>recognizing this attack as magic.</i>

249
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:30,353
You're amazing, Mistress Frieren.

250
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,064
So this is the highest form of magic?

251
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:37,193
But it's uncharacteristic of you…

252
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:41,322
You're completely vulnerable.

253
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,877
Well done, Fern.

254
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:58,840
It's been 80 years since the last time
I was forced into using that move.

255
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,607
Well then,
let's get this over with already.

256
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,161
So it ended?

257
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:31,873
I can't move anymore.

258
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:34,876
Wirbel, carry me please…

259
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:38,171
You two are constantly worn out.

260
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:51,517
So this is the innermost depths
of the Ruins of the King's Tomb?

261
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:55,980
You have raided
the Ruins of the King's Tomb.

262
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,817
That makes you
equivalent to a first-class mage.

263
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,403
Your names will go down in history
for this achievement.

264
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:07,033
As promised, everyone who made it
to the innermost depths

265
00:22:07,116 --> 00:22:09,285
will pass the second stage.

266
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:15,667
And where did the greatest contributor
to our success go?

267
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,046
It's so dark!

268
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:22,090
It's scary!

269
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,593
It's dark… So scary…

270
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,054
Well, I might do the same thing.

271
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,682
-Oh dear.
-It's dark… So scary…

272
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:34,852
Well then, the second stage
of the exam is over.

273
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,857
Can you believe that it can
even use healing magic?

274
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,527
See? Isn't it amazing?

275
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,695
I guess.

276
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,158
Who are you?

277
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,751
<i>-We've been together.</i>
<i>-You were unlucky.</i>

278
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:22,835
<i>-Since I was small.</i>
<i>-Flamme's spell.</i>

279
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,754
<i>-I'm in a terrible mood.</i>
<i>-This will take time.</i>

280
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,339
<i>-Let's begin the third stage.</i>
<i>-Fern.</i>

281
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:27,757
<i>-Let's go back.</i>
<i>-Make fun of me like you always do.</i>

282
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,842
<i>"An Era of Humans."</i>

283
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,843
