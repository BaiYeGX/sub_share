00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:10,176
<i>So this was the aftermath</i>
<i>of his training, huh?</i>

00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:17,975
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

3
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,240
You aren't going to
fight the dragon, right?

4
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:59,577
Then why continue your training?

5
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,247
When I came to this village,

6
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,585
everyone looked dreary,
and they were terrified of the dragon.

7
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:13,174
But now, those same people
are laughing happily.

8
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,136
They say, "This village is safe
because Master Stark is here."

9
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,931
Even though I haven't done anything.

10
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,768
The only reason the dragon hasn't attacked

11
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:25,519
is because it's not in the mood.

12
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:33,611
If the dragon attacks the village,

13
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,654
will you fight?

14
00:02:36,238 --> 00:02:39,200
I'd rather die. But you know…

15
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,746
to the people of this village,
I am a hero.

16
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,291
I'm Stark, the hero of the village.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,960
I have to be the one who protects it.

18
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,131
That being said,

19
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,176
I might run away
when the time actually comes.

20
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,639
Even this scar on my forehead

21
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:04,391
is from an argument I had with my master

22
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,727
over not wanting to fight monsters.

23
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,318
<i>That was the first time he ever hit me.</i>

24
00:03:16,403 --> 00:03:18,656
<i>I'm sure I disappointed him.</i>

25
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,242
In the end,

26
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:24,578
my master didn't praise me even once.

27
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,337
What?

28
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,340
Master Stark,

29
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,926
I don't think you will run.

30
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:44,974
-What do you know about me?
-I don't know a thing.

31
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,518
But I remembered how scared I was.

32
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:49,436
Scared?

33
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:53,899
<i>The first time I fought a monster.</i>

34
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,194
<i>I had gone through</i>

35
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,572
<i>more than enough training up until then.</i>

36
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:02,658
<i>But I became</i>
<i>weak in the knees out of fear,</i>

37
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,327
<i>and I ran away.</i>

38
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,498
<i>The monster kept chasing me.</i>

39
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,418
<i>And for some reason Mistress Frieren</i>
<i>would not help me.</i>

40
00:04:12,501 --> 00:04:15,212
<i>Oh, that's how my master is too.</i>

41
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,631
<i>In the end, when it caught up to me,</i>

42
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,633
<i>I strengthened my resolve</i>

43
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:21,927
<i>and my body moved.</i>

44
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,852
All I needed was resolve.

45
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:34,231
Everything you've acquired up until now
will not betray you.

46
00:04:35,524 --> 00:04:38,485
You may be a hopeless coward,

47
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:41,405
but I am sure that your resolve

48
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:43,991
to protect the village is genuine.

49
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,127
Resolve, huh?

50
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,469
How was it?

51
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,680
I don't know.

52
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,016
I don't know,

53
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:13,354
but I'm sure it'll be all right.

54
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,908
He's not here. He ran, huh?

55
00:05:26,408 --> 00:05:28,077
And I had high hopes for him too.

56
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,745
Oh well.

57
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:32,456
Fern, it's time to play tag
with the dragon.

58
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:33,540
What?

59
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,087
Frieren.

60
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,675
You need me to buy you 30 seconds, right?

61
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,344
You're late.

62
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,639
Can you promise me one thing?

63
00:05:48,722 --> 00:05:50,683
Even if I die in the middle of it,

64
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:53,018
will you make sure to kill the dragon?

65
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:56,063
Okay, I promise.

66
00:05:57,022 --> 00:06:00,651
But why are you going this far
just for the villagers?

67
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,655
What?

68
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:07,574
Oh, I just thought
it was a strange question.

69
00:06:08,742 --> 00:06:11,203
I've been in this village
for three whole years.

70
00:06:14,081 --> 00:06:16,125
-Not very long, huh?
-It's very long.

71
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,048
All right, let's get this done!

72
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:27,636
-Your hands are shaking.
-It's scary, okay?

73
00:06:29,763 --> 00:06:31,348
You don't have to laugh.

74
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:33,726
You're just like Eisen.

75
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:35,728
<i>My master?</i>

76
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,064
We've got ourselves a strong opponent.

77
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:43,360
Eisen, your hands are shaking.
Are you scared?

78
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,988
Yeah.

79
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,906
You admit it so quickly.

80
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,785
Feeling scared is not a bad thing.

81
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,413
This fear

82
00:06:54,913 --> 00:06:57,583
is what got me this far.

83
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,005
You guys even tremble the same way.

84
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,762
<i>I see…</i>

85
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:15,184
<i>So Master</i>

86
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,520
<i>was also scared.</i>

87
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,939
<i>All I need</i>

88
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,025
<i>is my resolve.</i>

89
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:28,947
He's within the dragon's reach.

90
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,742
It's not attacking yet.

91
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:34,495
It's acting cautious.

92
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:37,373
<i>So I was right…</i>

93
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:48,258
<i>No wonder the village</i>
<i>was never attacked again.</i>

94
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:51,303
<i>Dragons are smart animals.</i>

95
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,766
<i>They aren't foolish enough to willingly</i>
<i>pick a fight with a strong opponent.</i>

96
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,020
<i>The reason why Eisen hit Stark</i>

97
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,981
<i>was not because Stark was weak</i>

98
00:08:03,732 --> 00:08:05,484
<i>or because Stark disappointed him.</i>

99
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:13,742
<i>We had a fight and parted ways.</i>

100
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,619
You hit him?

101
00:08:18,205 --> 00:08:22,292
My body reacted by reflex.

102
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:25,212
I feel bad for what I did.

103
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,841
I was scared.

104
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,137
I was scared, Frieren.

105
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,015
He truly is an amazing guy.

106
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,977
<i>My apprentice</i>

107
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,355
<i>will become an incredible warrior.</i>

108
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,308
Okay! Shoot it now!

109
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,647
Come on! Why aren't you shooting?

110
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,441
I did everything you asked!

111
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,693
You're making me fight alone?

112
00:09:29,776 --> 00:09:31,695
Don't you dare, you stinking hag!

113
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:34,490
-You're just like Master--
-It's already dead.

114
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,450
Huh?

115
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,119
"Stinking hag," huh?

116
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,747
<i>That's not going to end well.</i>

117
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:46,502
<i>Did I</i>

118
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:49,004
<i>do it?</i>

119
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,049
<i>I killed a dragon</i>

120
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,135
<i>on my own?</i>

121
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,429
Stark,

122
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,932
good job.

123
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:03,352
You exceeded my expectations. Well done.

124
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:09,066
A mountain of treasures!

125
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:11,151
We can't take all of that.

126
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:18,283
You're only allowed three.

127
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,164
It really is nonsensical.

128
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,875
How can you become engrossed in this?

129
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,293
It's a mountain of treasures.

130
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,463
Master said that the adventure

131
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,092
of the party of heroes was
completely nonsensical because of you.

132
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:36,426
Yeah?

133
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,345
He said it was

134
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,431
a nonsensical yet extremely fun journey.

135
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:48,855
Wow! Shaved ice is really coming out!

136
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,650
Wasn't it worth the search?

137
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:54,903
And this is the fluffy kind,
not the crunchy kind!

138
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:55,904
You're right!

139
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,239
What nonsense.

140
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:00,075
Are you okay with this?

141
00:11:00,158 --> 00:11:01,952
What's the harm?

142
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:04,288
Our journey has just begun.

143
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:08,292
Even the Hero of the South, who is known
as the strongest of mankind,

144
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,628
was killed by the Demon King's
Seven Sages of Destruction.

145
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:17,134
We don't know if we can
return alive either.

146
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:21,513
Eisen, do you want to go
on a difficult and painful journey?

147
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,018
You know,

148
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:30,564
I want to go on a fun journey
that we can call nonsensical

149
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:32,774
and laugh about once it's done.

150
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,362
Look at this!

151
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,364
It melts the moment you touch it.

152
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,159
-Don't touch it. It's food.
-Nonsense…

153
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:45,245
By the way, where's the syrup?

154
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:47,372
I don't have a spell that produces syrup.

155
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,375
-You don't?
-This is seriously nonsensical.

156
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,351
How is it? Can you see through it?

157
00:12:07,851 --> 00:12:09,061
I can see.

158
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:12,064
But it's not a very interesting spell.

159
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:15,192
Well, I'm sorry my body isn't interesting.

160
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:18,987
What?

161
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,324
-So small…
-It's not small!

162
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:26,411
Well then,
what are you going to do now, Stark?

163
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,331
You can return to Eisen's place too.

164
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,043
Master told you to take me along, right?

165
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:34,836
Plus,

166
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,922
I want to go on

167
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,800
a nonsensical journey too.

168
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,349
28 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

169
00:12:47,432 --> 00:12:49,851
RIEGEL CANYON IN THE CENTRAL LANDS
FORTRESS CITY, WAAL

170
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:54,356
The monsters are very active
in the northern lands.

171
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,443
Currently, we are not allowing
anyone through the checkpoint.

172
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,697
When will the checkpoint open up again?

173
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,449
Who knows?

174
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,868
For as long as I've been assigned here,

175
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,872
I have not allowed
a single monster or man through.

176
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,834
Excuse me.

177
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,628
Captain, the castellan is asking for you.

178
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,171
I'll be there.

179
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,133
Got that, adventurers?

180
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:25,429
Make sure that you don't
cause any trouble in this city.

181
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:32,686
That wasn't a very nice welcome.

182
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,940
Yeah. He is a very capable guard.

183
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:38,567
Being strict to outsiders

184
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:42,154
is how a true guard
who protects the citizens should act.

185
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:46,867
And so…

186
00:13:47,951 --> 00:13:49,995
This city seems safe,

187
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:52,164
so let's wait it out here.

188
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:56,668
I can finally take my time
and study magic again.

189
00:13:56,751 --> 00:14:00,172
I'll drop my luggage off at the inn
and go to the magic store.

190
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,759
What?

191
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:08,054
The checkpoint isn't open,
so we have no choice.

192
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:10,682
All right, we'll split up here.

193
00:14:10,765 --> 00:14:12,726
I'll go book an inn.

194
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,771
Want to go get food?

195
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,275
Never mind, I'll go by myself.

196
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:22,944
So scary…

197
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,994
I heard you can't even go
by sea these days.

198
00:14:31,703 --> 00:14:34,998
They say an army from the northern lands
is being deployed,

199
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:38,335
but it'll take at least
two years for the checkpoint to reopen.

200
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:41,463
It's terrible for businesses.

201
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,218
This brings back memories.

202
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,970
The Jumbo Berry Special.

203
00:14:49,596 --> 00:14:51,515
The last time I came here, I was a kid

204
00:14:51,598 --> 00:14:55,185
so I couldn't eat it all
and I shared it with Master.

205
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,189
But was it this small?

206
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:03,819
You feel that way
because you've become an adult.

207
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,154
I see.

208
00:15:06,988 --> 00:15:08,824
I'm the one who grew, huh?

209
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,953
<i>Everything seemed so big when I was a kid.</i>

210
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:16,164
<i>But even Master's broad shoulders</i>

211
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,000
<i>started looking small after a while.</i>

212
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,587
Eisen is up in years now.

213
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,257
You better be a good son to him.

214
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,261
I'm trying to right now.

215
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:32,055
But really, was it always this small?

216
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,642
The passage of time
is very harsh, isn't it?

217
00:15:41,022 --> 00:15:42,649
What? Don't judge me.

218
00:15:42,732 --> 00:15:44,734
I bought it with my own money.

219
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,696
Excuse me, can I have milk please?

220
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:49,030
Coming up.

221
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,325
Uh, what?

222
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:53,910
Why are you mad?

223
00:15:55,203 --> 00:15:56,162
Master Stark…

224
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,373
Fine, I'll give you half.

225
00:15:58,456 --> 00:16:00,041
That's not what I want.

226
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:04,546
If I told you that we might have to
stay here for over two years,

227
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,714
how would you feel?

228
00:16:05,797 --> 00:16:07,173
Huh? I'd hate that.

229
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:10,760
-Right? You'd hate that, right?
-Yeah…

230
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,053
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

231
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:14,097
I'm so relieved.

232
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,766
So you are normal after all.

233
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,561
Hey, did I do something wrong?

234
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,190
A way to pass through the checkpoint, huh?

235
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,235
Sure, I'll help you find one.

236
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,195
Thank you.

237
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:33,199
We can't just jump and fly over it?

238
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:36,494
You can't cross the border facing

239
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,664
the northern lands because of
a powerful barrier that stretches

240
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,583
up to its highest possible limit.

241
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,001
That makes sense.

242
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,795
Otherwise, it'd be open
to monsters who can fly.

243
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,966
That can't be helped.
Let's check the merchants guild.

244
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,719
It might be open for trade at least.

245
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:06,483
Trade has been completely blocked.

246
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:09,569
They won't even allow guarded caravans.

247
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,572
The northern lands
must be pretty dangerous.

248
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,868
I guess we'll have to wait
until things settle down.

249
00:17:17,994 --> 00:17:18,870
No.

250
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:22,207
Let's try the black market
and thieves' guild.

251
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:25,293
Isn't that too dangerous?

252
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:29,255
Don't worry. I come across pretty strong.

253
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,882
And I'm good at faking it.

254
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,136
-You do have a villain's face.
-Shut up.

255
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,906
No success, huh?

256
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,534
I guess it's to be expected.

257
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,703
This is basically a defensive war.

258
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:02,163
You can't do anything
unless the gate opens.

259
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:03,707
All right.

260
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:06,710
Next, let's try the guard station
just in case.

261
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,173
-What?
-Nothing…

262
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,135
I'm just surprised at
how cooperative you are.

263
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:17,554
You're the one who brought it up.

264
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:19,931
You didn't want to wait, right?

265
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:22,934
You look more desperate than me.

266
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:29,107
Well, I don't have much time after all.

267
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,859
What do you mean?

268
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,572
This is a nice view, isn't it?

269
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:37,699
You can see the northern lands.

270
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:42,370
When I was small, Master brought me here.

271
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,584
We departed from this city

272
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:50,086
and headed to the northern lands.

273
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,714
What kind of journey was it, Master?

274
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,340
You want to know?

275
00:18:55,258 --> 00:18:57,719
At the time, we…

276
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:00,972
<i>He never talked about himself at all,</i>

277
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,893
<i>but he eagerly talked about</i>
<i>the adventures of the party of heroes.</i>

278
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,688
<i>He treasured that adventure</i>
<i>more than anything</i>

279
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:12,859
<i>even though it only accounted</i>
<i>for ten years of his long life.</i>

280
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,613
I'm sure Frieren is the same way.

281
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,783
I don't know…

282
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:24,287
Master is too old to travel now.

283
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,042
But he told you two
to take me along with you.

284
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,297
That's why I'm going to experience

285
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,425
a nonsensical yet fun journey in his place

286
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,804
and bring back stories to share with him.

287
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:45,391
This is about the only way
I can repay him.

288
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:50,355
If I take too much time,
Master is going to die.

289
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,487
Well then, we can't waste time
in a place like this.

290
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:02,408
But then again,
I'll bet he is going to live for a while.

291
00:20:15,171 --> 00:20:16,464
Mistress Frieren.

292
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:19,717
What are you doing here?

293
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,469
Shush, be quiet.

294
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,805
I'm being chased.

295
00:20:32,063 --> 00:20:34,357
Wh… What did you do?

296
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,775
I don't know.

297
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:38,486
I was only going from
one magic store to the next.

298
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:44,659
I am terribly sorry!

299
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:47,162
Mistress Frieren, please forgive me!

300
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:52,625
Wait… I'm getting a very bad feeling…

301
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,505
It seems the captain of the guards
treated you disrespectfully.

302
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:01,801
As the castellan appointed to this city,
I apologize.

303
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,721
Uh, it's nothing.

304
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:07,348
He was only doing his job as a guard.

305
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,475
And I am in no hurry at all.

306
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,476
Actually, I want to--

307
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,230
You are going to embark on a journey
to the north again, right?

308
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,108
I hear that the northern lands

309
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,904
are constantly fighting against
the remnants of the Demon King's army.

310
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm sure you are heartbroken
by their situation.

311
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:27,785
Your willing spirit
is indeed that of a hero.

312
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:31,706
I am sure it will delight
the people of the northern lands.

313
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,293
Please pass through
the checkpoint as you wish.

314
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:50,892
Who knew we could pass through so easily?

315
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:55,438
Maybe we should have mentioned
your name from the start?

316
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,775
I thought it would be useless
even if I did.

317
00:21:59,275 --> 00:22:01,069
I wanted to take my time…

318
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:05,365
And plus, I don't like
these kinds of things very much.

319
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:08,451
This view makes me feel uneasy.

320
00:22:09,452 --> 00:22:11,955
I'm glad I got to see this view.

321
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:23,466
Master must have departed
for the northern lands like this too.

322
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,730
Yeah.

323
00:22:40,441 --> 00:22:43,361
I wanted to study more magic…

324
00:22:43,444 --> 00:22:44,654
She's still whining.

325
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:47,573
We went through a lot of trouble,
you know.

326
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,117
-Right?
-Yes.

327
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:22,251
<i>-It hurts.</i>
<i>-Humans make such a big deal.</i>

328
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,294
<i>-Tonight is…</i>
<i>-Mother.</i>

329
00:24:23,377 --> 00:24:24,337
