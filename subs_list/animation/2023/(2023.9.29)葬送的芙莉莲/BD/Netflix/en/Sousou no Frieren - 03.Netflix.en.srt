00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,718
27 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

3
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,845
TRADE CITY, WARM, IN THE CENTRAL LANDS

4
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,861
Okay, let's split up and stock up
on things we need for the road.

5
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,198
Split up?
I'm getting most of the necessities.

6
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:58,743
Food, water, everyday items…

7
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,121
Mistress Frieren,
what are you going to buy?

8
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:05,875
Things like herbs…

9
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:11,380
<i>She's making that face that she does</i>
<i>when she's hiding something.</i>

10
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:14,884
<i>I've known Mistress Frieren for a while.</i>

11
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,886
<i>I know nothing good will come from this.</i>

12
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,930
<i>She always buys useless things.</i>

13
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,894
-I couldn't help but buy it.
-What is it for?

14
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:29,148
-This solution only melts clothing.
-Go and return it.

15
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:32,526
It's a book on the history of magic.
It's good to study too.

16
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>Well, I guess that wasn't exactly useless.</i>

17
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:43,120
Well, see you later at the inn.

18
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:56,050
<i>We can't waste our travel expenses.</i>

19
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,304
<i>I have to keep an eye on her.</i>

20
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:05,893
<i>An accessory shop?</i>

21
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,149
You went to sleep
without drying your hair again.

22
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,776
Jeez…

23
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,489
<i>I didn't know she was interested</i>
<i>in fashion.</i>

24
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,579
<i>She's thinking really hard about it.</i>

25
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,750
<i>What's up with that face?</i>

26
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,670
<i>I've never seen Mistress Frieren</i>

27
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,421
<i>thinking that hard about anything.</i>

28
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:57,778
<i>That took a long time.</i>

29
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,869
<i>I don't mind if it's accessories.</i>

30
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:07,580
<i>It's better than weird bones or solutions.</i>

31
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,378
<i>Maybe I should get started on my shopping.</i>

32
00:04:14,461 --> 00:04:17,882
Is there a good dessert place around here?

33
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:21,010
<i>Now that's not fair!</i>

34
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:25,723
There's an underground bar over there,
so you should ask them.

35
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:26,682
Thanks.

36
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,853
<i>Even I haven't eaten</i>
<i>anything sweet for months!</i>

37
00:04:52,374 --> 00:04:53,626
This is the place?

38
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,338
Is there a good dessert place around here?

39
00:04:57,421 --> 00:05:01,133
<i>Uh, obviously this isn't the place</i>
<i>to ask about desserts!</i>

40
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,844
A dessert place?

41
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,721
Are you kidding me?

42
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:08,891
<i>Gulp.</i>

43
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,646
This town has a ton of great desserts!

44
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:17,524
We can tell you about any store out there.

45
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:20,402
<i>They actually know?</i>

46
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,614
You look tough, but you're in the know?

47
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:27,534
Desserts are a source of energy
for adventurers like us.

48
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,912
<i>They were adventurers?</i>

49
00:05:29,995 --> 00:05:32,748
<i>They look much worse</i>
<i>than just "tough guys."</i>

50
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:34,667
<i>They're too scary!</i>

51
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:37,211
Bye!

52
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,592
<i>Is she going to a dessert shop?</i>

53
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,931
<i>Oh? This is…</i>

54
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:53,102
<i>the direction our inn is located.</i>
<i>Is she going back?</i>

55
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,561
Oh!

56
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:57,106
<i>I haven't done my shopping at all.</i>

57
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,819
You're late.

58
00:06:01,902 --> 00:06:04,071
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:07,241
Well, whatever. Put down your things.

60
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,460
Let's go eat something sweet for once.

61
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:37,479
What a great view.
No wonder they recommended it.

62
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,399
Mistress Frieren,

63
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,235
I'm sorry I doubted you.

64
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:44,737
What do you mean?

65
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,488
Nothing…

66
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,074
Choose whatever you want.

67
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,036
Do we have enough money?

68
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,288
I have my savings.

69
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:57,416
<i>She had savings?</i>

70
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,174
Mistress Frieren, what will you order?

71
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:08,135
Let's see… Today I feel like…

72
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,013
Merkur pudding, right?

73
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:16,769
Let me guess,
you feel like Merkur pudding?

74
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:18,520
How do you know?

75
00:07:19,104 --> 00:07:22,358
How long do you think we've been
traveling together?

76
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:23,901
I can tell.

77
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,909
I don't know anything about you guys.

78
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:35,871
Then I guess I'll try my best
to get you to know me.

79
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,666
By the way,
my favorite food is ruf-omelet.

80
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,669
I like grapes. The sourer the better.

81
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,630
-I like--
-Alcohol, right?

82
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:47,508
I know that, Corrupt Priest.

83
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,718
That's not something to blush about.

84
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:54,056
Isn't it bad that a priest drinks so much
that everyone knows.

85
00:07:55,682 --> 00:07:57,267
I'm sorry, Fern.

86
00:07:59,144 --> 00:08:00,521
Why are you apologizing?

87
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,817
I don't know anything about you, Fern.

88
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,652
So I didn't know

89
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:09,488
what kind of things you like.

90
00:08:14,284 --> 00:08:17,871
I had forgotten that today is my birthday.

91
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:29,967
What a pretty hair accessory.

92
00:08:31,009 --> 00:08:34,471
Thank you very much. I'm really happy.

93
00:08:35,305 --> 00:08:36,348
You are?

94
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,978
It seems like you are
horrible at taking hints,

95
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:42,479
so I'll be straightforward.

96
00:08:43,897 --> 00:08:46,483
I am extremely happy that you tried

97
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,944
to get to know me.

98
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,239
Even though I only tried?

99
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:59,830
Mistress Frieren, you really don't
understand people's feelings, do you?

100
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:12,009
-Let's leave soon.
-Okay.

101
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,774
By the way, Mistress Frieren,

102
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,737
is there a goal to this journey?

103
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,033
Not really. I'm traveling as a hobby
to collect spells.

104
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:38,535
But

105
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:40,370
<i>I want to revisit</i>

106
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:44,124
<i>the traces from my adventure</i>
<i>with Himmel and the crew as much as I can.</i>

107
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,919
Before they fade away.

108
00:09:47,586 --> 00:09:50,172
That must be very important

109
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,382
to you, Mistress Frieren.

110
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,426
I don't know.

111
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,929
That's why I want to know.

112
00:10:03,018 --> 00:10:06,021
Jeez, I can't believe
you're taller than me now.

113
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:09,816
I am already 16 years old, after all.
I'm a lady now.

114
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:11,818
A lady…

115
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,573
We're eating the same things and yet…

116
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,492
What a mystery.

117
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,830
{\an8}KILLING MAGIC

118
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,833
27 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

119
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,836
GRÖSSE FOREST IN THE CENTRAL LANDS

120
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,568
You've gotten used to
using defensive magic.

121
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:57,614
Now, let's put it into practical use.

122
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,252
I attacked the gaps in your defense.

123
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:12,879
If it wasn't training, you'd be dead.

124
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:14,840
Well then…

125
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:17,676
How will you tackle this?

126
00:11:19,636 --> 00:11:20,512
Like this.

127
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:21,763
I see.

128
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,266
Can you handle this?

129
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:35,235
That's all for today.

130
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,996
Defensive magic is powerful,

131
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,040
but it eats up a lot of mana.

132
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:51,168
If you keep using it in wide ranges,

133
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:53,628
you'll run out of mana
in less than a minute.

134
00:11:55,255 --> 00:12:00,344
So, the correct way is to activate it
in sections, right as the attack lands?

135
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:01,928
That's right.

136
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,268
Up we go.

137
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,614
We've only been practicing
defensive magic.

138
00:12:20,697 --> 00:12:23,241
It's directly related
to your chances of survival.

139
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,368
That's true.

140
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:28,455
You can stop almost all offensive magic
with defensive magic.

141
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:30,999
It's so powerful, it's mind-boggling.

142
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,459
Fern,

143
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:35,128
you didn't read the history of magic
book, did you?

144
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,383
Magic involves more than
just practicing it.

145
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:45,764
I guess I need to read it to you
as a bedtime story.

146
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:46,890
I'll read it myself.

147
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:49,351
I'm not a child.

148
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:00,028
This is our destination?

149
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,906
Are you collecting another weird spell?

150
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:05,909
No, not this time.

151
00:13:05,992 --> 00:13:08,245
It depends on the weather.

152
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:09,955
I guess so.

153
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:12,374
Can I ask you about something?

154
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,919
-It's an elf.
-With white hair?

155
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:20,173
Are you Mistress Frieren by any chance?

156
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,718
How do you know me?

157
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:28,765
You want to know
the location of the sealed Qual, right?

158
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,685
I'll show you the way.

159
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,104
Qual?

160
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:36,606
Qual, the Elder Sage of Corruption.

161
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:40,569
<i>He is a demon who committed</i>

162
00:13:40,652 --> 00:13:43,864
<i>atrocities in this land 80 years ago.</i>

163
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:46,032
<i>However, Himmel the Hero</i>

164
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,869
<i>and his party sealed him away for us.</i>

165
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:54,332
That seal is going to break soon,
so I came to eliminate him.

166
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,210
How did you know that though?

167
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,379
I didn't tell anyone about this.

168
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,507
Until about 30 years ago,

169
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:06,636
Master Himmel would visit the village
almost every year.

170
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:11,141
He said it was to check on how
the seal was holding up.

171
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:12,893
Such a nice guy, as usual.

172
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,771
He would talk about you too,
Mistress Frieren.

173
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:20,525
He called you "a cold-hearted person
who never comes to visit."

174
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,861
Isn't she cold?

175
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:24,529
That is cold.

176
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,781
<i>Well excuse me.</i>

177
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:27,574
But

178
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:30,535
she's not cold-hearted enough
to abandon the village.

179
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:35,040
She'll appear by the time
the seal is about to break.

180
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,293
That is what he told me.

181
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,337
I see.

182
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,304
This is it?

183
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:05,737
It's pretty vulnerable.

184
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:08,824
Let's unseal Qual tomorrow

185
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,534
and get rid of him.

186
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:21,253
Mistress Frieren, you sealed Qual, right?

187
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:24,714
Is there a reason why you did that?

188
00:15:26,132 --> 00:15:28,677
Simply because Qual was strong.

189
00:15:33,056 --> 00:15:34,307
<i>We couldn't win against him.</i>

190
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:39,521
<i>Qual was one of the best</i>
<i>mages in the Demon King's army.</i>

191
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:41,565
<i>Zoltraak.</i>

192
00:15:42,315 --> 00:15:45,610
<i>That's the first piercing magic in history</i>
<i>which Qual developed.</i>

193
00:15:46,653 --> 00:15:49,030
<i>It pierced through</i>
<i>the defensive magic of humans</i>

194
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,867
<i>as well as magic-resistant equipment.</i>

195
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:54,828
<i>It's a spell that</i>
<i>directly destroys the body.</i>

196
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:58,290
In this region, 40% of adventurers

197
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,334
and 70% of mages

198
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,087
were killed by Zoltraak,
according to records.

199
00:16:07,632 --> 00:16:09,718
That's way too powerful.

200
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,347
That's right. It was too powerful.
Much too powerful.

201
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:18,602
That is exactly why
its power backfired on him.

202
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,354
What do you mean?

203
00:16:25,817 --> 00:16:28,111
You really didn't read
the history of magic book.

204
00:16:28,987 --> 00:16:30,780
Maybe you need story time after all.

205
00:16:31,364 --> 00:16:32,866
I'll read it now.

206
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:34,993
No, it's fine.

207
00:16:35,785 --> 00:16:38,371
Getting enough sleep is more important.

208
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,166
You'll find out tomorrow anyway.

209
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,840
I'll break the seal.

210
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,260
Don't let your guard down.

211
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:23,708
Long time no see, Frieren.

212
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:26,544
How many years has it been?

213
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,254
Eighty years.

214
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,549
Merely 80 years?

215
00:17:32,175 --> 00:17:33,969
To us, at least.

216
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,597
What about the Demon King?

217
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,598
We killed him.

218
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:40,642
I see.

219
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,520
Well then,

220
00:17:43,603 --> 00:17:46,106
I guess I should get revenge.

221
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:48,608
Fern, activate defensive magic
in front of you.

222
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:51,528
Zoltraak!

223
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:02,622
That's surprising.

224
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:05,625
You resisted Zoltraak?

225
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:11,006
That must be
a very advanced defensive spell.

226
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:13,883
Mistress Frieren,

227
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,052
what is going on?

228
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,514
That was ordinary offensive magic.

229
00:18:20,306 --> 00:18:22,142
That just now was Zoltraak.

230
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,894
The one he developed.

231
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,731
A spell to kill humans.

232
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,319
Qual,

233
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,864
your magic was too powerful.

234
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,492
<i>After you were sealed,</i>

235
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,661
<i>mages from around the continent</i>

236
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,290
<i>studied and analyzed Zoltraak.</i>

237
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:47,834
<i>In just a few years,</i>

238
00:18:47,917 --> 00:18:51,171
<i>Zoltraak was incorporated into</i>
<i>the framework of mankind's magic.</i>

239
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:54,132
<i>And they developed</i>
<i>powerful defensive magic</i>

240
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:56,968
<i>based on a new defensive spell.</i>

241
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:02,432
The level of magic-resistance
of equipment has improved too.

242
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,895
Zoltraak is no longer
a spell that can kill humans.

243
00:19:07,812 --> 00:19:10,899
Now, it's called ordinary offensive magic.

244
00:19:14,527 --> 00:19:18,281
Apparently, 80 years is
a very long time for humans.

245
00:19:18,865 --> 00:19:20,116
Qual,

246
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,869
if you behave, I will kill you with mercy.

247
00:19:23,953 --> 00:19:25,163
Interesting…

248
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:28,041
Very interesting.

249
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:31,044
It synchronizes with the offensive magic

250
00:19:31,127 --> 00:19:34,506
and disperses the power, huh?

251
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:37,550
What a complicated spell.

252
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:42,305
I bet it uses up a lot of mana as well.

253
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:44,933
He realized the weakness
of defensive magic.

254
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,811
Fern, you can handle it, right?

255
00:19:48,311 --> 00:19:49,479
Yes.

256
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:51,773
I already saw this during training.

257
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,943
Then shield me as well.

258
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,472
Oh, you can fly? Interesting!

259
00:20:25,431 --> 00:20:26,683
Zoltraak.

260
00:20:36,317 --> 00:20:38,862
Frieren…

261
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:43,366
that's my… magic…

262
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:59,465
-We're so glad!
-Thank you so much.

263
00:21:00,049 --> 00:21:03,344
Now we can live in peace.

264
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:06,347
Hey, that hat…

265
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:08,308
This?

266
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:11,102
In this region,

267
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,897
the sun still shines brightly
at this time of year,

268
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,857
so it's needed for farming.

269
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,194
I've seen this somewhere.

270
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:26,910
You…

271
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:29,829
You're the brat who flipped my skirt.

272
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,753
What are you doing, you damn brat?!

273
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:39,964
I'll kill you! I wanted to see too!

274
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,424
You shouldn't kill him.

275
00:21:41,507 --> 00:21:43,927
Come on, I'll show you mine.

276
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,887
Wow…

277
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,892
You are still alive?

278
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:54,646
Thanks to you,
I feel like I can live even longer.

279
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:59,984
I'm glad I believed Master Himmel
and waited for you.

280
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,414
They were all thanking you,
Mistress Frieren.

281
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,792
It wasn't directed toward me.

282
00:22:17,418 --> 00:22:20,964
The people of this village
believed in Himmel.

283
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:24,258
I don't know the details,

284
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:29,305
but I'm sure Master Himmel
believed in you.

285
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,478
What's wrong?

286
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,355
Nothing.

287
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:22,794
<i>-I felt pity.</i>
<i>-It's more convenient that way.</i>

288
00:24:22,877 --> 00:24:25,421
<i>-Is she really from primitive times?</i>
<i>-No sad stories!</i>

289
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,715
<i>-It was a long time ago.</i>
<i>-I reached it.</i>

290
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,801
<i>"The land where souls rest."</i>

291
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:30,885
