1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,920
Indeed, there is no end
to the search for strength.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:08,215
You are one step closer to
finding the secret.

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:12,553
There is nothing left for me to teach you.

4
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,473
You tell me that every day.

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,977
Oh, Fern?

6
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:21,395
Pout…

7
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,773
She's angry? Why?

8
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:25,858
I'm scared.

9
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,279
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

10
00:02:00,077 --> 00:02:02,246
I had a fight with Mistress Frieren.

11
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:05,875
Again?
This has been happening a lot lately.

12
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,920
The upcoming third stage
is the final stage of the exam, right?

13
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:11,881
This is no time to be fighting.

14
00:02:11,964 --> 00:02:14,008
This time, she has crossed the line.

15
00:02:14,633 --> 00:02:18,262
My staff broke during the battle
in the Ruins of the King's Tomb,

16
00:02:19,138 --> 00:02:22,516
<i>so I told Mistress Frieren</i>
<i>that I wanted to get it repaired.</i>

17
00:02:23,142 --> 00:02:25,352
But she told me that I should throw away

18
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,855
my old staff and buy a new one.

19
00:02:28,355 --> 00:02:29,648
That staff?

20
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:33,110
She said it was shattered
and can't be fixed.

21
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,698
<i>But still,</i>

22
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,451
<i>I received that staff from Master Heiter.</i>

23
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,498
<i>I've had it ever since I was small.</i>

24
00:02:46,957 --> 00:02:49,877
You know how Frieren is.
She didn't mean to hurt you.

25
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:52,880
For me, the thought of

26
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,883
throwing it away
never even crossed my mind.

27
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,264
The next first-class mage exam
is three years from now, huh?

28
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,142
Three years is a long time.

29
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,394
Go ahead and laugh at me, like usual.

30
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,315
You want me to laugh at you?

31
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:13,150
No.

32
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,280
Well then, little Lawine,
want me to pat you on the head?

33
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,578
You want to fight?

34
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,375
Hurry up.

35
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,127
She's really taking it hard.

36
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:36,549
Oh, it's Frieren.

37
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,976
What's that bag?

38
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,395
Hey.

39
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,772
How long are you going to stay here?

40
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,776
I failed the exam. We have
nothing to do with each other anymore.

41
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,737
You're interfering with my business.
Go away.

42
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,950
I am here as a customer right now.

43
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:05,661
Then hurry up and pick something.

44
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:12,251
-You can have it.
-Keep it.

45
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:15,671
You were out of luck this time.

46
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:20,176
The situation was not in our favor.

47
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,180
<i>Everybody who was there</i>
<i>could have ended up like you.</i>

48
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:28,434
Either way, I still failed.
I didn't have enough skill.

49
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,478
Don't bring this subject up again.

50
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,940
I may not look it,
but I am in the worst mood.

51
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,194
And yet you still opened your shop.

52
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:44,158
Denken,
this may come as a surprise to you,

53
00:04:44,241 --> 00:04:46,327
but no matter how bad their mood is,

54
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,829
people need to work
to put food on the table.

55
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:53,834
I see.

56
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,840
Well, it's a good thing that
I was the one who dropped out.

57
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,509
First-class mage exams
are once in three years.

58
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,844
Denken,

59
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:08,474
for a feeble old man like you,
that time may never come.

60
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:10,976
True.

61
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,436
At least try to retort.

62
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,695
Richter, you really are
an impudent little punk.

63
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,990
You disrespect authority
and are willing to

64
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,202
mistreat the weak for the sake of
fulfilling your purpose.

65
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,830
You are definitely no saint.

66
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:36,669
Despite that,
I don't have any ill feelings toward you.

67
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,004
That is probably

68
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,466
because I used to be
an impudent little punk myself.

69
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:45,594
But look at me now.

70
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:49,098
I am now an Imperial Mage.

71
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:51,225
What are you trying to say?

72
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,729
What I mean is,
you don't have to be so pessimistic.

73
00:05:55,813 --> 00:06:00,067
Three years from now, you will be
much stronger than you are now.

74
00:06:01,276 --> 00:06:02,987
Let's go, Laufen.

75
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:09,201
Sorry. That old man isn't good
at expressing his feelings.

76
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:11,620
What is your relationship with him anyway?

77
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,375
That old fart…

78
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:19,628
In the end, he didn't even buy anything.

79
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:35,769
Today is really not my day, is it?

80
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,981
I asked around town,
and everyone said that

81
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:43,027
you would be able to repair any staff,
no matter how broken it is.

82
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,405
Let me see.

83
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,951
What are all these pieces?

84
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,745
Don't tell me this is a staff.

85
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:55,539
What am I supposed to do with this trash?

86
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,291
It's not trash…

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,834
I think.

88
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:05,716
I was starting to feel a little better,

89
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:09,303
but now I'm back to being
in a horrible mood because of you.

90
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:12,931
I have the right to choose my jobs.

91
00:07:13,974 --> 00:07:15,434
Just give up on this staff.

92
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:17,644
I see.

93
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,398
If you're unable to fix it, it's okay.

94
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:27,279
Frieren, you sure know
how to get on my nerves, don't you?

95
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:31,033
When did I ever say I was unable to do it?

96
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,334
Can you finish it by today?

97
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,462
I want it ready by
the third stage of the exam.

98
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:45,130
What an unreasonable request.

99
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,554
-Frieren.
-What?

100
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,099
I'm sorry for calling it trash.

101
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,685
It's a nice, well-maintained staff.

102
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:01,855
I can tell the owner really treasured it.

103
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:09,822
Fern, let's go back already.

104
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:15,786
Mistress Frieren
doesn't understand me at all.

105
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:18,330
Well, I don't understand you either.

106
00:08:18,914 --> 00:08:21,834
Stop it! Don't take it out on me!

107
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:25,462
In my opinion,

108
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,090
that is why it's important
to try to understand.

109
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,968
I think Frieren is doing her best.

110
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:42,354
Oh, you're Frieren's…

111
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,398
apprentice, right?

112
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,026
Am I wrong?

113
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,237
No, you're right.

114
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,407
Well, I couldn't care less either way.

115
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:56,243
The second stage just ended,

116
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,872
and I'm already being overworked
because of your master.

117
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,959
It would have been better for my business

118
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:06,128
if she had just bought a new one.

119
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:09,089
Take good care of it.

120
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,091
SWALLOW INN

121
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:26,523
My staff…

122
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,534
Frieren lacks emotions and sensibility.

123
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:42,289
I'm sure that will lead to
difficulties and misunderstandings.

124
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:46,585
But there is also one good thing about it.

125
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,963
<i>To make up for what she lacks,</i>

126
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,591
<i>Frieren will spend more time</i>
<i>worrying about you.</i>

127
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:57,513
<i>You're not going to find</i>
<i>another master like her that easily.</i>

128
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:15,572
It's dark…

129
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:34,967
Um, Mistress Frieren, about yesterday…

130
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:36,969
What?

131
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:42,849
Never mind. It's nothing.

132
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:45,310
Okay.

133
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,983
We will now begin
the third stage of the exam.

134
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,447
Do you know the reason why I came

135
00:10:58,031 --> 00:11:00,534
all the way here, Sense?

136
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,788
You're not going to answer?

137
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,749
This is how you are
whenever things become inconvenient.

138
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,129
There were 12 people
who passed the second stage.

139
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:15,424
That is an unprecedented number.
It's too many.

140
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,553
I don't mind exams where
everybody joins forces.

141
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,682
The existing first-class mages
lack a sense of cooperation, after all.

142
00:11:24,182 --> 00:11:25,559
I'm afraid that's true.

143
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,228
But among them

144
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,065
was one person with too much power.

145
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,444
You mean Mistress Frieren?

146
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,866
Thanks to that, many inadequate people
were able to pass as well.

147
00:11:41,366 --> 00:11:43,660
If they go onto
the third stage as scheduled,

148
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:46,288
they will all die.

149
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,290
Sense,

150
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:51,626
that's not even close to what you desire.

151
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,171
And even I don't want

152
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:57,382
to waste the lives of this many people.

153
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,967
Mistress Serie…

154
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:01,178
You don't have to apologize.

155
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:03,513
It's all Frieren's fault.

156
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:06,641
We'll make an exception this time.

157
00:12:07,225 --> 00:12:09,686
I will take care of the third stage.

158
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,690
I'll select them in a peaceful way.

159
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:17,861
You were
in charge of it originally, right?

160
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,739
You don't mind, do you, Lernen?

161
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:24,743
This isn't my first time

162
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:28,246
being at the mercy
of your one-sided decisions.

163
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,165
Plus,

164
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:34,002
I am not at a level where I can
test Mistress Frieren.

165
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,630
Just one glance, and I knew

166
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:39,758
that she was suppressing her mana.

167
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,512
She has an enormous amount of mana.

168
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:46,765
It is on par with you, Mistress Serie.

169
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:52,396
Falsch, did you notice?

170
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:55,357
No, I don't know what he's talking about.

171
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:59,277
I saw her mana with my own eyes
at the exam hall.

172
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:03,240
I highly doubt that her mana
was suppressed.

173
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,536
It didn't even have the characteristic
of instability of suppressed mana.

174
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,706
All living organisms with mana
have this instability

175
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,291
and it cannot be stopped.

176
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,378
Even if that is possible,

177
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:18,713
it'd take an exorbitant amount of time.

178
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,300
It is by no means a practical skill.

179
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:27,556
Frieren dedicated her entire life
to this so-called unpractical skill.

180
00:13:28,723 --> 00:13:30,559
In order to deceive demons.

181
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:38,608
Demons are far more sensitive to mana
than mankind.

182
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,319
Unless you're some kind of prodigy,

183
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,114
you wouldn't be able to
deceive them just by suppressing

184
00:13:44,197 --> 00:13:45,866
your mana for 100 or 200 years.

185
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,285
It's literally a waste of time.

186
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:52,038
Using that time on other training
would make you

187
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,707
significantly stronger.

188
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:55,792
It's completely inefficient.

189
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:58,003
However,

190
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:01,465
such inefficiency can open up
a window of opportunity.

191
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,010
When it comes to battles
between skilled mages,

192
00:14:05,093 --> 00:14:09,306
miscalculating your opponent's mana
can lead to your death.

193
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:12,184
<i>Frieren is living proof.</i>

194
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:15,103
<i>Her level of skill is low</i>
<i>for someone her age,</i>

195
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,856
<i>but she's been defeating demons this way.</i>

196
00:14:19,107 --> 00:14:23,612
That is how
precise Frieren's mana suppression is.

197
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:25,864
As far as I know,

198
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:28,950
the Demon King is the only one
who noticed in one glance.

199
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:34,080
At least, that's what I thought
up until now, Lernen.

200
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:37,417
It was a coincidence.

201
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,253
I happened
to see the slightest instability.

202
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,005
That's all.

203
00:14:43,131 --> 00:14:45,675
You're so modest and dependable.

204
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:50,263
It's been half a century
since you became the very first

205
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,724
first-class mage.

206
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:58,021
You are still the same timid boy
you used to be.

207
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,359
And that's why it's such a shame.

208
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:05,779
You've made it this far, and yet you

209
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,281
don't have much longer to live.

210
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,538
You probably will never have the chance
to battle Frieren.

211
00:15:15,622 --> 00:15:18,458
Even if it's a battle
you can possibly win.

212
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:24,047
I really shouldn't take in
any human apprentices.

213
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,592
It's such a shame…

214
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:33,306
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>not even he could notice the instability</i>

215
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,601
<i>of my mana, huh?</i>

216
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,814
The third stage of the exam

217
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,025
will be an interview
with the Great Mage Serie.

218
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:46,236
I didn't expect that.

219
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:50,115
Serie has no intention of letting us pass.

220
00:15:50,198 --> 00:15:51,616
You know her?

221
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,201
From a long time ago.

222
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,205
She's probably going to choose
who passes by instinct.

223
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,709
But Serie's instincts are always right.

224
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:02,419
As proof of that,

225
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:06,298
I still haven't become the mage
that Serie wants me to be.

226
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,752
-Excuse me.
-You fail. Go home.

227
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:47,505
Can I ask why?

228
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:51,718
Right now, you are afraid of my mana.

229
00:16:52,218 --> 00:16:55,013
You are well aware of your limits.

230
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:59,768
You can't visualize yourself
as a first-class mage, can you?

231
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:02,187
In the world of magic,

232
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,856
you can't actualize it
if you can't visualize it.

233
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:07,692
That's the basic principle. Go home.

234
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,904
Fail. Fail.

235
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:13,490
Fail. Fail.

236
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,035
Frieren,

237
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:22,040
you also can't visualize yourself
as a first-class mage, can you?

238
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:25,543
But the reason is different
from the other examinees.

239
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:30,924
You are absolutely sure that
I'm not going to let you pass.

240
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,425
It's the truth, right?

241
00:17:34,177 --> 00:17:35,887
I will give you one chance.

242
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,306
Tell me a spell you like.

243
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,433
The spell to create a field of flowers.

244
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,438
You learned that from Flamme, huh?

245
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:49,317
How stupid. You fail.

246
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,152
Okay.

247
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,411
You're not going to stand your ground
even after being ridiculed?

248
00:17:59,911 --> 00:18:02,080
It's hard to believe that a mage

249
00:18:02,163 --> 00:18:04,916
like you was able to
defeat the Demon King.

250
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,838
I didn't do it alone.

251
00:18:10,505 --> 00:18:14,384
Himmel, Eisen, Heiter, and me.

252
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:17,262
If even one of us was missing,
we couldn't have done it.

253
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,223
You were blessed with good comrades?

254
00:18:20,807 --> 00:18:22,475
How lucky of you.

255
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,227
That's right.

256
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,062
<i>I was lucky.</i>

257
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:29,357
Himmel,

258
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:32,444
why did you invite me into the party?

259
00:18:34,112 --> 00:18:36,865
Because I was looking for a strong mage.

260
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:39,909
There are a bunch of them
in the royal capital.

261
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,870
It didn't have to be me.

262
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:44,372
I wanted you.

263
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,874
Why?

264
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:51,212
Frieren, you probably don't remember,

265
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:54,924
but I've met you once in the past.

266
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,302
Yeah, I don't remember at all.

267
00:18:57,802 --> 00:18:58,845
I figured.

268
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:03,224
When I was a kid,
I entered a forest to pick herbs

269
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,517
and got lost.

270
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,980
<i>For a while, I was wandering around</i>
<i>the forest at night.</i>

271
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,775
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>
<i>I experienced solitude.</i>

272
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,029
<i>I thought I would never be able</i>
<i>to return to the village.</i>

273
00:19:18,364 --> 00:19:19,699
<i>But then</i>

274
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,620
<i>an elf pointed to the direction</i>
<i>of civilization.</i>

275
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:27,040
<i>She literally only showed me the direction</i>

276
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:30,043
<i>and didn't give me</i>
<i>any words of encouragement.</i>

277
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,631
<i>As a child,</i>
<i>I thought she was so coldhearted.</i>

278
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:38,259
<i>I don't know if you sensed my fear</i>

279
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,012
<i>or if you just did it on a whim, but…</i>

280
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:47,310
<i>you showed me</i>

281
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:51,064
<i>the spell to create a field of flowers.</i>

282
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,947
<i>I thought it was beautiful.</i>

283
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,827
For the first time in my life,
I thought magic was beautiful.

284
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:10,959
It's probably nothing but a coincidence,

285
00:20:11,626 --> 00:20:14,003
but the "stupid" spell
that Master taught me

286
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,549
was what brought me together
with Himmel and the crew.

287
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:21,803
Also, Serie,

288
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:25,723
I'm sure you're planning on
failing Fern as well,

289
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:28,059
but I don't think you can.

290
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:32,939
She will exceed your expectations.

291
00:20:34,232 --> 00:20:36,609
We've entered the era of humans.

292
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,115
<i>She will "exceed my expectations"?</i>

293
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,493
<i>My mana has her paralyzed with fear.</i>

294
00:20:46,327 --> 00:20:48,621
<i>She's the same as all the other examinees.</i>

295
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,590
Wait, what is it that you see?

296
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:05,096
It's unstable.

297
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:10,685
Your name is Fern, right?

298
00:21:11,936 --> 00:21:14,647
Become my apprentice.

299
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,025
What? No.

300
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:24,407
You won't regret it.

301
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:29,495
I will be able to take you
to even greater heights.

302
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:36,294
To a level which
no other mage has ever reached.

303
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,091
Will that impact my result on this exam?

304
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:44,427
Maybe it will.

305
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:49,182
I see.

306
00:21:51,434 --> 00:21:52,602
Mistress Serie…

307
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:02,862
<i>Fern,</i>

308
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:06,324
I'm sure Serie is going to
say this and that,

309
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:08,743
but you don't need to
listen to her demands.

310
00:22:09,535 --> 00:22:13,122
Just as I will be failed
no matter what I say to Serie,

311
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,125
you will pass
no matter what you say to her.

312
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,880
After all,
Serie's instincts are always right.

313
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,511
I am Mistress Frieren's apprentice.

314
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:35,478
You were advised by Frieren, huh?

315
00:22:36,604 --> 00:22:40,149
I'm not foolish enough to let
a promising mage slip away.

316
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:43,903
You pass.

317
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,325
Next!

318
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:29,801
<i>See you again.</i>
