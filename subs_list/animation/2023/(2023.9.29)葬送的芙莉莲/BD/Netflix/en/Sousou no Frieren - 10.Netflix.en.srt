1
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,894
-Flamme.
-Call me Master.

2
00:00:22,229 --> 00:00:23,606
What is it?

3
00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:26,609
Do you really think it's a dirty trick?

4
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:32,865
Frieren, do you remember
Basalt's last words?

5
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:35,493
I don't.

6
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,288
They use words to deceive humans.

7
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:44,335
That's right. They are nothing but
monsters who can speak.

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,673
That is the reality of those beings
that I call demons.

9
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:52,468
They play dirty tricks.

10
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:55,721
And so we have to play
even dirtier tricks.

11
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,600
If that's what it takes
to eliminate the demons,

12
00:01:00,184 --> 00:01:02,812
I will gladly accept a bad reputation.

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,320
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

14
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,624
<i>I can't stop bleeding.</i>

15
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,626
<i>So this is it, huh?</i>

16
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:52,630
With this, your plan has failed.

17
00:02:53,589 --> 00:02:55,090
I guess so.

18
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,135
But Frieren won't be left unharmed.

19
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,097
She must be fighting Mistress Aura by now.

20
00:03:03,098 --> 00:03:07,144
Last time, we had to retreat
because of the party of heroes,

21
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:11,273
but now there are no heroes
to protect Frieren.

22
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,777
Frieren is no doubt a threat to us.

23
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:18,739
But her level of mana
is nothing compared to Mistress Aura.

24
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,367
If she fights her head-on,

25
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,702
Frieren will definitely lose.

26
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,539
If that's the case,
Mistress Frieren will win.

27
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:32,253
She's not the type of person
who would ever fight a demon head-on.

28
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:34,755
She will kill Aura by deceiving her.

29
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,510
<i>What nonsense… As far as I can remember,</i>

30
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:43,764
<i>Frieren the Slayer has always</i>
<i>fought us head-on…</i>

31
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,144
<i>Why do I feel like I'm missing something?</i>

32
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:51,647
<i>This girl's mana is weak…</i>

33
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:56,569
<i>But I was overpowered by the amount</i>
<i>of magic that she fired at great speed.</i>

34
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:02,408
<i>So how was she able to do that</i>
<i>without running out of mana?</i>

35
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,369
I see!

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,705
I can't believe it…

37
00:04:09,456 --> 00:04:11,167
So Frieren is the same as you?

38
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,586
How dirty.

39
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,507
You two should be ashamed
to even call yourselves mages.

40
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:22,136
Mistress Frieren knows that all too well.

41
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,023
How horrible…

42
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,276
A village of elves, huh?

43
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:51,582
Basalt the Throne,

44
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:54,043
one of the Demon Generals
of the Demon King's army.

45
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:58,047
I'm guessing he led his troops
to destroy the village.

46
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:02,801
Are you the one who killed him?

47
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,178
You half-dying girl.

48
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:13,103
What immense mana.

49
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,313
I bet you're strong.

50
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,274
Did you fight the demons head-on?

51
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,821
How ridiculous. That's so stupid.

52
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:26,533
Why do people try to fight them head-on?

53
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,078
You can run, hide,
or catch them by surprise.

54
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:31,580
There are so many other options.

55
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:35,584
I don't understand
what it feels like to be a powerful mage.

56
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,586
You should know.

57
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,880
Huh?

58
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,716
You should know how I feel.

59
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,179
Because you are

60
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:49,890
a much more powerful mage than me.

61
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,111
What made you think so?

62
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,114
It's a hunch.

63
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,326
What's your name?

64
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:17,376
-What happened to the village?
-Completely annihilated.

65
00:06:17,459 --> 00:06:19,420
The women and children were killed too.

66
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,381
I couldn't protect them.

67
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,217
Even though I was the strongest.

68
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,845
You really are stupid.

69
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:31,140
If I were you, I would've run away
without even thinking.

70
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:35,310
-Let me down.
-I won't.

71
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,522
You have talent,
so I'm taking you in as my apprentice.

72
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,234
And I'm sure you're aware of it,

73
00:06:42,317 --> 00:06:45,779
but if I hadn't passed by,
you would've died.

74
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,449
On top of failing to protect the village,

75
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:49,992
you were about to die.

76
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,536
That's what you call dying in vain.

77
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:56,582
We're being followed.

78
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:00,377
They're stronger
than the general you killed.

79
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,803
Aren't they funny?

80
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,806
They concealed their mana
until the last minute

81
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,309
and were obviously trying to ambush us,

82
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,354
but as soon as
they saw that we were mages,

83
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,397
they proudly showed themselves.

84
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,568
They play dirty tricks and are cunning,

85
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:29,490
but they all have a ridiculous sense
of pride when it comes to magic.

86
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,992
Human mage,

87
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,745
leave that elf behind.

88
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,873
Will you let me go if I do?

89
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:40,667
The Demon King's orders were to massacre

90
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,878
all of the elves.

91
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:45,964
I don't care about your life.

92
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:47,674
Is that right?

93
00:07:51,845 --> 00:07:52,763
Frieren,

94
00:07:53,722 --> 00:07:58,102
it's true that I know too well
how powerful mages feel.

95
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:02,147
And I know exactly how
these demons feel too.

96
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,650
They have pride and confidence

97
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:08,028
in the magic that they've
devoted their lives to studying.

98
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:12,533
In other words,
it's worthless arrogance and carelessness.

99
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,050
Frieren, unlike you, these demons

100
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,803
assumed that I was weak.

101
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:37,099
They were excellent mages
of a higher caliber,

102
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,518
but they died
because they let their guard down.

103
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:45,065
You limit the amount of mana that emits
from your body to hide your strength?

104
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,693
That's right.

105
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:52,322
I take advantage of their misconception
of my mana to deceive and kill them.

106
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,742
It's a dirty and despicable method

107
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:58,328
that makes a mockery of honorable magic.

108
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,722
Your wounds are looking much better.

109
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,602
Shall we start training soon?

110
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,856
-Flamme.
-Call me Master.

111
00:09:30,527 --> 00:09:33,447
Demons took everything away from me.

112
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,740
Me too.

113
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,035
I hate them so much
I want to eliminate all of them.

114
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,496
Me too.

115
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,749
But I like magic.

116
00:09:43,832 --> 00:09:45,000
I do too.

117
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:51,006
So we don't need anyone else
to play dirty tricks that

118
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:52,841
make a mockery of magic.

119
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:57,971
What do I have to do to train?

120
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:02,392
Try to let out less than a tenth of
the amount of mana you usually emit.

121
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:07,564
As I expected, you're suppressing it well.

122
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:12,027
Any elf can do this much.

123
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,238
Now keep that up
while learning the basics.

124
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,491
We'll increase your fundamental mana.

125
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:20,327
-That's all?
-It's easy, right?

126
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:26,500
By the way, for how long
do I have to suppress my mana?

127
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:28,585
It's tiring to do it for too long.

128
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,421
For as long as me.

129
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,298
Your entire life.

130
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:37,803
You will deceive demons
for as long as you live.

131
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,434
Lügner died.

132
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:48,021
Now all of your executioners are gone.

133
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,148
You failed, Aura.

134
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,901
Yes, that's too bad.

135
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,071
But if I can defeat you here,

136
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:57,739
that'd be a worthy achievement.

137
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:01,493
In this battle, you released

138
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:05,831
many of my immortal soldiers
from my control.

139
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:08,458
Was it really wise to

140
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,837
expend that much mana in front of me?

141
00:11:14,756 --> 00:11:16,133
<i>The Scales of Obedience.</i>

142
00:11:16,758 --> 00:11:19,261
<i>You place both souls on the scale</i>

143
00:11:19,344 --> 00:11:22,597
<i>and the being with greater mana</i>
<i>subjugates the other.</i>

144
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:26,518
<i>Aura is able to use</i>
<i>this risky spell because of her</i>

145
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:28,687
<i>tremendous amount of mana.</i>

146
00:11:29,771 --> 00:11:31,273
<i>Generally, mana increases</i>

147
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:34,359
<i>according to the amount of time</i>
<i>you have trained.</i>

148
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,740
<i>I can tell from the mana that Aura emits</i>

149
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:43,577
<i>that she is a greater demon</i>
<i>that has lived over 500 years,</i>

150
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,872
<i>and that she has dedicated</i>
<i>most of her life to training.</i>

151
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:50,334
<i>500 years, huh?</i>

152
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:53,211
<i>That's a very long time, even for a demon.</i>

153
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,505
<i>She must've been invincible up until now.</i>

154
00:11:56,506 --> 00:12:00,177
<i>I can get this much information</i>
<i>just from the mana emitting from her body.</i>

155
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:04,264
<i>Despite that,</i>
<i>demons don't hide their mana.</i>

156
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:05,766
<i>They can't hide it.</i>

157
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,393
How pitiful.

158
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,398
Auserlese.

159
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:18,403
Master,

160
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:22,574
demons are cunning, right?

161
00:12:22,657 --> 00:12:26,536
Why don't they suppress their mana
at all times, like you do?

162
00:12:28,246 --> 00:12:29,289
They just can't.

163
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,418
Although demons are
all about individualism,

164
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,003
in order to fight humans,

165
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,798
they need at least
some sort of social structure.

166
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,676
What do you think
is necessary in a society?

167
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:45,305
-Order?
-That's right.

168
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:50,185
In other words, you need
an important person to lead the society.

169
00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:52,479
For humans…

170
00:12:52,562 --> 00:12:54,523
In this country, for example,

171
00:12:54,606 --> 00:12:57,567
status and wealth decide who is important.

172
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:02,322
That well-dressed person who came out
of the palace is important.

173
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,200
It's hard to tell who is important,

174
00:13:05,283 --> 00:13:09,287
so people dress up like that
in order to make it obvious.

175
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:11,456
Demons are different?

176
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:16,545
They haven't changed ever since
they were monsters.

177
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,547
Strength equals importance.

178
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,590
It's much easier to tell than humans.

179
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,093
You can see how strong they are.

180
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,845
Mana, right?

181
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,472
To them, mana means the same thing

182
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,016
that status and wealth mean to humans.

183
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,352
You can even say it's their dignity.

184
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,855
They may temporarily hide

185
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:38,275
their mana as a way to go under the radar,

186
00:13:38,358 --> 00:13:42,487
but no one is stupid enough
to limit their mana on a daily basis.

187
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:46,616
There's a big difference between a noble
going incognito to visit the castle town

188
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:51,246
and a noble relinquishing
their status and wealth, right?

189
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:57,085
And demon society is not kind enough
to give those with little mana

190
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,504
any sense of dignity.

191
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,215
<i>That's why the stronger the demon is,</i>

192
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,509
<i>the more they flaunt their mana.</i>

193
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:10,015
<i>To them, nothing good comes from</i>
<i>constantly limiting their mana.</i>

194
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:12,767
The thought doesn't even
cross their minds.

195
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,061
It's pitiful, isn't it?

196
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,731
Just as humans are bound
by status and wealth,

197
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:20,525
demons are bound by mana.

198
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,195
They take pride in magic

199
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:25,489
and love magic more than anyone,

200
00:14:25,572 --> 00:14:28,200
but they don't have freedom
over their own mana.

201
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:32,662
Frieren, you're lucky you weren't a demon.

202
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:36,041
Yeah. Thanks to that,
I can deceive demons.

203
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,924
It's been three years since you began
suppressing your mana, huh?

204
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:47,928
I knew I could expect a lot from you.

205
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:55,101
You look the part now.

206
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:59,856
Frieren, do you still like magic?

207
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:03,485
What's this all of a sudden?

208
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:06,488
So-so, I guess.

209
00:15:07,322 --> 00:15:09,032
In the past,

210
00:15:09,115 --> 00:15:11,743
you said you liked magic
without hesitation.

211
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,246
That was only 50 years ago.

212
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,998
That's true.

213
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,210
In the end,

214
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:24,089
I could only teach you how to fight.

215
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:26,341
Spells to get revenge.

216
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,512
-Do you regret it?
-No.

217
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:35,392
I'm glad that I entrusted
my spells to you.

218
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:37,894
With your long lifespan,

219
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,898
you'll be able to reach a level
where you can defeat the Demon King.

220
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:47,279
Frieren, I have one favor to ask you.

221
00:15:48,071 --> 00:15:49,281
What is it?

222
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:53,159
Make the area around my grave
a field of flowers.

223
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,371
-That's unlike you.
-I know.

224
00:15:57,914 --> 00:15:59,165
Frieren,

225
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,419
my favorite spell

226
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:05,255
is the spell to create a field of flowers.

227
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,426
My parents taught that to me
when I was small.

228
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:12,262
It's the reason why
I started to like magic.

229
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,018
Teach me that spell.

230
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,861
Listen, Frieren.

231
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:31,281
Don't think about
leaving your mark on history.

232
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:33,658
Live modestly.

233
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:39,748
You will leave your mark on history
when you kill the Demon King.

234
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:43,561
I heard there was a mage that has been
living in this forest for ages.

235
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:45,438
Is that you?

236
00:17:46,481 --> 00:17:48,566
I've been living for a long time,

237
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,360
but I've just been killing time.

238
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,571
It's not like I'm talented.

239
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,326
-What do you think, Heiter?
-Yeah.

240
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,705
Her mana level is about a fifth of mine.

241
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,959
-It's so-so.
-Who is he? How annoying.

242
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,711
Go home.

243
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:10,463
You don't have any business
with a so-so mage, do you?

244
00:18:11,089 --> 00:18:15,093
No, you're stronger than
any other mage I've ever met.

245
00:18:16,761 --> 00:18:18,096
What makes you think so?

246
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:21,099
It's a hunch.

247
00:18:26,312 --> 00:18:27,313
Auserlese.

248
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,710
You look happy, Aura.

249
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:50,962
Are you sure of your victory?

250
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,965
You'll see.

251
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,718
<i>Frieren the Slayer.</i>

252
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,681
<i>People came to know her</i>
<i>for the first time about 80 years ago.</i>

253
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,602
<i>She defeated the Demon King</i>
<i>with the party of heroes.</i>

254
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:09,189
<i>A mysterious elf mage</i>
<i>whose age is unknown.</i>

255
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:15,445
<i>But I couldn't care less about how long</i>
<i>you've been living.</i>

256
00:19:15,528 --> 00:19:18,198
<i>Your mana says it all.</i>

257
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,826
<i>I can read you like a book.</i>

258
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,913
<i>You may be a talented mage,</i>

259
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:27,165
<i>but your mana is nothing special.</i>

260
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:32,170
<i>You've trained for maybe</i>
<i>a total of 100 years.</i>

261
00:19:32,253 --> 00:19:35,256
<i>Not just that, it hasn't even changed</i>
<i>since 80 years ago.</i>

262
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,302
<i>Maybe you were training</i>
<i>in areas other than mana,</i>

263
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:41,930
<i>or maybe you were just killing time?</i>

264
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,057
<i>Either way,</i>

265
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,435
<i>you are nothing compared to me.</i>

266
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,696
I win.

267
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:06,204
Now I will chop off your head myself.

268
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,546
<i>I didn't even have to go out of my way</i>
<i>to exhaust her mana.</i>

269
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,257
<i>I was a little too cautious.</i>

270
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:21,010
<i>My immortal army suffered</i>
<i>quite a bit of damage,</i>

271
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,595
<i>so I have to replenish them.</i>

272
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,350
<i>What?</i>

273
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,979
<i>The scale is tipping toward Frieren.</i>

274
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:35,483
You put my soul on the scale, Aura?

275
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:41,823
Honestly, I would've had a hard time
if you kept attacking with your army.

276
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:45,493
I'm glad you have
so much confidence in your mana.

277
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:48,037
I can finally defeat you.

278
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:50,373
What do you mean?

279
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,876
You should have noticed by now.

280
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:55,879
I was suppressing my mana.

281
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:59,632
You judged incorrectly, Aura.

282
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:03,428
That can't be true.

283
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:06,014
There's no way
I would fail to notice that.

284
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:08,433
Your mana was not

285
00:21:08,516 --> 00:21:12,145
unstable or wavering, which are
characteristics of suppressed mana.

286
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,189
I'm surprised.

287
00:21:14,272 --> 00:21:17,650
Demons are able to observe mana
in such detail, huh?

288
00:21:18,818 --> 00:21:21,404
I guess Master's method was right.

289
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:27,118
I have spent most of my life
suppressing my mana.

290
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,204
Long enough for it to become natural.

291
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:32,332
Are you stupid?

292
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:34,918
Why would you do something so pointless?

293
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:37,837
Yes, it's stupid.

294
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:40,548
But I can beat you.

295
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:45,803
Don't be ridiculous!

296
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,057
I'm a greater demon
who has lived over 500 years.

297
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,229
Aura, you are standing in front of

298
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,485
a mage who has lived
more than 1,000 years.

299
00:22:14,415 --> 00:22:15,375
<i>Frieren,</i>

300
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:19,128
<i>just as demons deceive people with words,</i>

301
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,882
<i>you must deceive demons with your mana.</i>

302
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:27,387
Aura, kill yourself.

303
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,605
This can't be…

304
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:41,317
How can I…?

305
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:22,752
-<i>Is there someone who commends you?</i>
<i>-A journey to heaven, huh?</i>

306
00:24:22,835 --> 00:24:24,754
<i>-You're in great shape.</i>
<i>-The Largest Magical City.</i>

307
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:25,963
<i>-What is that?</i>
<i>-It's Äußerst.</i>

308
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,799
<i>It means we're elves.</i>

309
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,884
<i>"Winter in the Northern Lands."</i>
