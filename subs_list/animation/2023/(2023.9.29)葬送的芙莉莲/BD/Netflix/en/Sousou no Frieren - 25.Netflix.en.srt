1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:04,754
Since we have such little information,

2
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:08,090
we should prepare just in case
it doesn't have a mind.

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,552
In that case, we'll have to
use sheer force.

4
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,013
Is that possible?

5
00:00:14,513 --> 00:00:16,223
I don't know.

6
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:22,855
Um, in that case…

7
00:00:24,148 --> 00:00:28,361
I might be able to kill Mistress Frieren.

8
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,656
Yeah?

9
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:32,990
Yes.

10
00:00:41,874 --> 00:00:44,877
Well then, let's draft up a plan.

11
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:49,090
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

12
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:23,434
First, let's make sure
we're on the same page.

13
00:02:23,517 --> 00:02:25,978
In the event that the clone has a mind,

14
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,355
we'll use Edel's hypnosis magic

15
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,733
to break through my mental defense.

16
00:02:30,816 --> 00:02:33,360
-And to have Fern kill me. Is that right?
-Yes.

17
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,404
How can you say "yes" so easily?

18
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,451
Dünste.

19
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:50,085
Where is Edel?

20
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,881
<i>We were attacked by Sense's clone,</i>

21
00:02:53,964 --> 00:02:55,758
<i>and she dropped out of the exam.</i>

22
00:02:57,593 --> 00:03:00,346
I see. And Blei as well?

23
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:07,019
I was able to run to safety
because he bought me time.

24
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,898
<i>I hope he was able to escape safely.</i>

25
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,951
Don't mind me! Go!

26
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,748
But…

27
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:30,709
Anything's better than having
zero participants pass.

28
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,260
I have information.

29
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,679
Will you cooperate with me?

30
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,183
I was willing to do that
from the very beginning.

31
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,437
Is there anyone who can heal?

32
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:55,693
I have Scriptures, so I can
perform simple healing magic.

33
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:57,403
Thank you.

34
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:05,161
I see.

35
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:08,164
So the clones don't have minds.

36
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:11,750
That's right. According to Edel,

37
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,296
they're just imitating the workings
of a mind very precisely.

38
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:17,798
But they don't have a real mind.

39
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,552
Now there is no easy way of defeating it.

40
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,806
We have to draft up a plan
with that in mind.

41
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,726
That being said,

42
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:31,437
there are still too many unknown factors.

43
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,273
The biggest issue to focus on

44
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:37,693
is the identity of
those clones and the caster of the spell.

45
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:41,947
We can't take action
until we understand their nature.

46
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:46,827
We especially need to find out
if they really don't have any weaknesses.

47
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:50,664
If that clone is really
on the same level as Frieren,

48
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,374
some of us may end up dead.

49
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,712
I won't give any answers.

50
00:04:56,795 --> 00:04:57,838
I thought so.

51
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,758
It doesn't have any weaknesses.

52
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,510
The one manipulating the clones

53
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,348
is a monster from mythical times
called Spiegel.

54
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:09,058
Lawine.

55
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,643
How do you know?

56
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,396
My oldest brother
was part of the advance party sent by

57
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:18,609
<i>the Continental Magic Association</i>
<i>to raid the Ruins of the King's Tomb.</i>

58
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,154
So you had information?

59
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,740
No wonder you were
able to make it this far.

60
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:30,037
But what you did wasn't very logical.

61
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:32,248
If you knew, you should have

62
00:05:32,331 --> 00:05:35,542
shared this information
and cooperated with us from the beginning.

63
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,963
No one seemed to be
in the mood to cooperate.

64
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:43,133
Plus, Frieren and Fern went in ahead of us
before we knew it.

65
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,927
And you, old man,

66
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,597
are the type to abandon your comrades
if it's not against the rules.

67
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,393
Why would we cooperate with you?

68
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,021
You really got on their bad side.

69
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,857
I am, indeed, an old man.

70
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,652
But it hurts when you say it to my face.

71
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,031
-You should probably apologize.
-Sorry about that, old man.

72
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,662
According to the observations
of the advance party,

73
00:06:11,745 --> 00:06:15,124
Spiegel is on the other side of that door,

74
00:06:15,207 --> 00:06:16,917
inside the treasure vault.

75
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,878
<i>Supposedly, the monster itself</i>

76
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,423
<i>is weak and has no means of attack.</i>

77
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,635
{\an8}If you defeat it,
all the clones will disappear.

78
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,140
That matches up with the results
from our mana detection.

79
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:35,644
The monster is beyond that door.

80
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:40,024
But that door has
a powerful binding spell cast on it.

81
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,985
I noticed that too.

82
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:45,696
My clone must have done that.

83
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:50,701
<i>The spell that shuts the door of</i>
<i>a treasure vault at the risk of your life.</i>

84
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,080
It's one of the most powerful
binding spells in all folk magic.

85
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,876
That door will not open
unless the caster dies.

86
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,922
We could ignore the door completely
and break down the wall,

87
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,467
but it probably has
a workaround for that too.

88
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:12,139
Either way, in order to get to Spiegel,

89
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:15,934
we have no choice
but to defeat that clone.

90
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,355
Then you'd better hurry up.

91
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,565
What do you mean?

92
00:07:22,149 --> 00:07:27,321
Spiegel creates clones of
everyone inside the dungeon.

93
00:07:27,988 --> 00:07:29,490
And those clones

94
00:07:29,573 --> 00:07:33,327
instinctively flock to
the innermost depths over time.

95
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:37,581
<i>Aside from my brother's unit,</i>

96
00:07:37,664 --> 00:07:41,293
most of the members of the previous
advance party were annihilated.

97
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:45,839
They were annihilated right here,

98
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,133
just before the innermost depths.

99
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,766
I see.

100
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,060
Excuse me.

101
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:02,189
The clones imitate the workings
of a mind very precisely, right?

102
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,943
That means they have the same
behavioral weaknesses

103
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,694
as their originals, right?

104
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:09,446
Most likely.

105
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,827
In that case, we might have a chance.

106
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,663
What is this "weakness"
you're talking about?

107
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,251
Mistress Frieren,

108
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,671
can you please
stand by that wall over there?

109
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,172
Sure.

110
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,776
This is…

111
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,528
It can't be…

112
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,030
Unbelievable…

113
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,949
Did you notice?

114
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:57,286
-Do you get it?
-No.

115
00:08:57,369 --> 00:09:01,707
This is, indeed, Frieren's fatal flaw.

116
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:05,377
Why didn't I notice this
when I fought her?

117
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,255
No…

118
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:11,925
I knew she was skilled, and that
preconception prevented me from noticing.

119
00:09:13,927 --> 00:09:15,929
The moment she uses magic,

120
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:19,183
her mana detection is interrupted
for a split second.

121
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,353
Isn't that a common mistake
made by apprentice mages?

122
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,689
I've always been bad at that.

123
00:09:25,772 --> 00:09:29,443
If you were aware of it,
why didn't you tell us?

124
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,029
Because it's embarrassing.

125
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:34,531
Now is not the time to be saying that.

126
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:39,578
But all her other skills
are just too exceptional.

127
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,332
Very few mages would be able to actually

128
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,125
take advantage of her flaw.

129
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,920
Anyway,
let's just start a strategy meeting.

130
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:13,111
Even if we get rid of Frieren's clone…

131
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:16,740
Mistress Frieren,
you look like you're having fun.

132
00:10:17,574 --> 00:10:18,617
Yeah.

133
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,503
Sounds like we have a plan.

134
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:33,966
Eisen, you distract the monster
while I attack from the side.

135
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,219
Frieren, you provide covering fire.

136
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,136
What about Heiter?

137
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,639
He has a hangover, so he's useless today.

138
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,725
He's dead.

139
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,913
I just remembered how

140
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,917
we used to have discussions like this
when we fought dungeon bosses.

141
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,816
All right.

142
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,152
Let's start our raid.

143
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,071
Can we win?

144
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,948
Don't worry.

145
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,076
There is no such thing as a dungeon
that can't be raided.

146
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:46,913
I'm the mage from the party

147
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,708
that has raided
the most dungeons in history.

148
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,631
Are you sure you want to
fight Frieren's clone

149
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,551
all by yourselves?

150
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:04,306
It's easier to predict your opponent's
movements when there are fewer people.

151
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:05,223
Yes.

152
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:10,187
It's true that we would most likely win
if we all fought together,

153
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,731
but most of us would die in the process.

154
00:12:13,565 --> 00:12:16,985
You probably won't even have time
to use your evacuation golem.

155
00:12:17,527 --> 00:12:18,487
So you're saying

156
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,781
it is more important

157
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:24,326
to stop the clones that will
come to the innermost depth?

158
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,876
After all, we'd all be wiped out
if we got attacked from both sides.

159
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,879
Okay, let's go according to plan.

160
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,882
All right. I wish you good luck.

161
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,512
Go ahead and open it.

162
00:13:03,573 --> 00:13:04,408
Well then…

163
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,746
Let's go around and say who the toughest
opponent would be for each of us.

164
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,440
Judradjim.

165
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:44,156
<i>It's moving exactly how</i>
<i>Mistress Frieren predicted.</i>

166
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:01,965
Vollzanbel.

167
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:06,511
<i>Its mana detection was interrupted.</i>

168
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:10,849
<i>My clone will be wary of Fern,</i>
<i>who hid during that time.</i>

169
00:14:12,392 --> 00:14:15,687
<i>But it will be too busy fighting me,</i>
<i>its evenly matched opponent.</i>

170
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:19,274
<i>It won't have time to search for Fern.</i>

171
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,651
<i>After all,</i>

172
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,822
<i>nobody knows how dangerous I can be</i>
<i>more than I do.</i>

173
00:14:30,827 --> 00:14:32,078
Don't worry.

174
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,581
When you perfectly conceal yourself,

175
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:37,584
even I can't find you that easily.

176
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,837
But are you sure that Zoltraak
is the spell I should

177
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,547
use to attack?

178
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,926
It's the quickest spell to fire.

179
00:14:47,427 --> 00:14:49,346
Plus, Zoltraak is

180
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:52,307
a relatively newer spell among elves.

181
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:55,185
It hasn't been around long enough

182
00:14:55,268 --> 00:14:57,562
for our reflexes to
automatically defend us.

183
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,149
In order to counter it, we have to think,

184
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,318
so it takes a little longer,

185
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,822
even if it's just a split second.

186
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,324
But not for you, Fern.

187
00:15:10,617 --> 00:15:12,577
<i>For you, Zoltraak is something</i>

188
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,872
<i>that has always existed</i>
<i>from the time you were born.</i>

189
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,459
<i>It's fundamental magic</i>
<i>that comes naturally to you.</i>

190
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,215
Your Zoltraak would be able to kill me.

191
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,635
Put in all the mana you have.

192
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,279
Frieren,

193
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,490
you don't like me, right?

194
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:53,118
Why did you come see me?

195
00:15:53,201 --> 00:15:57,581
To tell you the truth,
I thought I'd never see you again.

196
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,501
I came to deliver my master's will.

197
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,380
It's been 50 years…

198
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:09,384
I see. So Flamme died, huh?

199
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,387
You're not sad?

200
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,890
I only raised her on a whim.

201
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:23,440
It's basically a report.

202
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,901
What did she write?

203
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,529
Apparently,
the emperor authorized the research

204
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,531
of magic on a national level.

205
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:34,784
Up until now, magic was viewed

206
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:37,787
as the art of demons
among human societies,

207
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:41,499
so studying it indiscreetly
was considered taboo.

208
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:45,462
Flamme was the one who proposed the idea,

209
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:49,591
and she took part in teaching
the newly established Imperial Mages.

210
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,552
She basically wrote to me

211
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,930
to ask me to take over in her place.

212
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,225
How greedy is she?

213
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,105
Just getting the authorization
for researching magic was a feat.

214
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,566
But she wants more?

215
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,319
Is this such a big deal?

216
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,407
This means the largest empire
on the continent will begin researching

217
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,701
and applying magic for military use.

218
00:17:17,827 --> 00:17:20,413
<i>The nations around it</i>
<i>won't be able to ignore that.</i>

219
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,165
<i>In just a few decades,</i>

220
00:17:22,248 --> 00:17:24,709
<i>magic will become</i>
<i>widespread throughout the continent.</i>

221
00:17:26,044 --> 00:17:30,090
A day will come when all of mankind
will be able to use magic.

222
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:33,093
In the not too distant future,

223
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:37,013
mankind will gain the power
to fight against the Demon King's army.

224
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,684
I see. That's pretty incredible.

225
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:42,560
I know.

226
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,815
But

227
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:49,609
that is not what I want.

228
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,821
Go home, Frieren.

229
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,366
There is no way I am going to
agree to this will.

230
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:57,867
It's extremely annoying.

231
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:02,747
"A time where
anyone can use magic," you say?

232
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:06,001
Magic should be special.

233
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,587
I don't plan to
teach anyone without talent.

234
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,757
To think she would send me this…

235
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,011
Flamme and I could never agree
until the very end.

236
00:18:17,178 --> 00:18:20,181
She's just an apprentice I raised
on a whim, after all.

237
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,766
Master said,

238
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,771
"Serie will most likely get mad
and rip up the will."

239
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,027
But she still wanted to tell you anyway,

240
00:18:32,527 --> 00:18:34,529
that her dream came true.

241
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:36,614
Don't ask me why.

242
00:18:41,244 --> 00:18:42,996
Well, I'll be off now.

243
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:46,249
I don't think we'll ever meet again.

244
00:18:46,332 --> 00:18:47,375
Frieren.

245
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,796
Before that, want to take a little walk?

246
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,759
We have all the time in the world, anyway.

247
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:02,557
It was Flamme's dream to see
the day when anyone

248
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,267
could use magic.

249
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,814
At first, it had nothing to do
with wanting to save mankind

250
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:12,108
or fight the Demon King's army.

251
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,361
She didn't care about any of that.

252
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:23,119
Do you know her favorite spell?

253
00:19:24,412 --> 00:19:26,456
<i>The spell to create a field of flowers.</i>

254
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,169
It's a stupid spell
that has no use whatsoever.

255
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,135
She really loved magic.

256
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,848
She sincerely wished for everyone
in the world to be able to

257
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,475
cast spells like that.

258
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,728
It gave me the creeps.

259
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,690
It sounded like
a little girl's cutesy dream.

260
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,902
But that's exactly what it was.

261
00:19:57,612 --> 00:20:00,907
It was a pipe dream that
she shared with me when she was

262
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,202
a little girl who was
much shorter than me.

263
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,622
Honestly, I thought

264
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,916
that day wouldn't come for a while

265
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,628
and that she couldn't possibly
make it come true.

266
00:20:16,881 --> 00:20:19,134
But in her short lifetime,

267
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,970
which amounts to
almost nothing in my eyes,

268
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:24,931
she was able to become
the progenitor of mankind's magic.

269
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,269
Master was always quick to make decisions.

270
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:32,438
It was as if she was pressed for time.

271
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:36,526
Humans have a limited lifespan.

272
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:39,946
They are closer to death than we are.

273
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:42,782
There are many times

274
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:46,703
in life when you have to
make big decisions,

275
00:20:46,786 --> 00:20:50,373
and humans like her cannot afford
to postpone making them.

276
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:56,254
For us, we could do it
100 or 200 years later.

277
00:20:57,005 --> 00:21:00,800
Even if we put it off for 1,000 years,
it wouldn't make any difference.

278
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:05,930
The time we have is close to an eternity.

279
00:21:08,474 --> 00:21:09,559
Frieren,

280
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:13,354
a long time has passed
since humans first created

281
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,356
what we call civilization.

282
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:19,444
From here, the generations
will come and go rapidly.

283
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,449
<i>In a mere millennium…</i>

284
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,995
<i>In a mere millennium,</i>
<i>it will become the era of humans.</i>

285
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,878
Humans will overtake us.

286
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:46,638
Don't neglect your training, Frieren.

287
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,401
If anyone can kill you,

288
00:22:01,152 --> 00:22:02,403
<i>it will be the Demon King</i>

289
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:07,408
or a human mage.

290
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:14,624
How exciting, Serie.

291
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:20,338
That means I will get to see lots of mages

292
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:23,299
and all kinds of spells.

293
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:20,792
<i>Well then.</i>

294
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,585
<i>-Let's get it over with.</i>
<i>-Both might die.</i>

295
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:23,920
<i>-Wow.</i>
<i>-I'll leave it to you.</i>

296
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:25,421
<i>-This won't work either.</i>
<i>-Mistress Frieren.</i>

297
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,757
<i>-I expected it.</i>
<i>-I have no choice but to do it.</i>

298
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,842
<i>So this is the height of magic?</i>

299
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,802
