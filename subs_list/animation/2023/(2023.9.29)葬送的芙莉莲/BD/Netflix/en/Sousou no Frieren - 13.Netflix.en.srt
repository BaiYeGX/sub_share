1
00:00:02,043 --> 00:00:03,336
I see…

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,963
You're an adventurer, huh?

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,636
Long time ago, I used to
dream of being an adventurer too.

4
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,805
It was like any other

5
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,850
stupid dream that kids fantasize about.

6
00:00:22,938 --> 00:00:26,609
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

7
00:01:54,947 --> 00:01:56,866
29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

8
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:58,451
ALT WOODS IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

9
00:01:58,534 --> 00:01:59,869
When I was a kid,

10
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:04,498
I had a best friend with whom
I had many little adventures with.

11
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:07,501
<i>He was a reckless ball of energy.</i>

12
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,962
<i>It was as if he was a gorilla.</i>

13
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,592
<i>But he was a kind gorilla</i>
<i>who cared about his friends.</i>

14
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:19,889
<i>After we had grown up</i>
<i>and I had forgotten all about my dream,</i>

15
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:25,478
<i>he invited me</i>
<i>to become an adventurer with him.</i>

16
00:02:27,396 --> 00:02:29,648
<i>Back then, if I had taken his hand,</i>

17
00:02:30,149 --> 00:02:32,193
<i>things would've been different.</i>

18
00:02:33,986 --> 00:02:36,030
That was ten years ago already.

19
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:38,365
But I still regret it to this day.

20
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,913
Why are you telling me this story?

21
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,708
It's almost time for the harvest festival
in my village.

22
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,378
And my older brother told me
to pick wild herbs in the forest

23
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,130
so we can cook with them.

24
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,340
But then…

25
00:02:56,425 --> 00:02:58,469
I got stuck in a bottomless swamp.

26
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,179
I'm…

27
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:02,681
done for.

28
00:03:03,891 --> 00:03:09,647
But if you take my hand,
something may change.

29
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:13,734
Just a second. I'm contemplating.

30
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,864
What is there to contemplate about
at this point?

31
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,324
Your hand is dirty.

32
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,744
This is no time
to be caring about stuff like that.

33
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:26,497
And plus, young lady,

34
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:31,627
adults are all dirty
in one way or another.

35
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:36,340
I've never had to deal with someone
who's dirty in a literal sense.

36
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,551
Can you give me some time?

37
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:42,346
I'll try to remember the spell to
pull someone out of a bottomless swamp.

38
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:47,059
-Try to hurry.
-Let's see…

39
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,602
Mistress Frieren,

40
00:03:49,311 --> 00:03:51,063
did you get all the medicinal herbs?

41
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,023
Oh, I remembered it.

42
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:01,157
Up to here is fine.

43
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:04,326
I apologize on behalf of Mistress Frieren.

44
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,287
Don't worry about it.

45
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,205
She saved me in the end.

46
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,748
No, I will make sure

47
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:12,168
to scold her very firmly.

48
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:13,252
I'm staying out of it.

49
00:04:14,211 --> 00:04:17,131
Are you sure
you don't want to stop by the village?

50
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:21,010
We're busy with the harvest festival,
but I can at least thank you.

51
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:24,013
We want to stock up on materials,

52
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,682
so we want to get
to a large town by today.

53
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:27,933
I see.

54
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,852
Well then, be careful.

55
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:33,105
There are a lot of dangerous,
poisonous creatures here.

56
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:35,357
-Yeah.
-Okay.

57
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,619
I got bitten.

58
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,705
Bitten?

59
00:04:49,788 --> 00:04:53,500
Didn't he tell us to be careful?
What are you thinking?

60
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,461
Anyway, let's stop the bleeding.

61
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:56,879
Oh?

62
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,506
My nose is bleeding.

63
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,219
Analyzing types of poison

64
00:05:03,302 --> 00:05:06,805
is a spell used by priests,
so it's not my forte.

65
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,390
I'm unfamiliar with this reaction,

66
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,643
so the antidotes I have may not work.

67
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,729
It's better to get it checked at a church.

68
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:17,691
Fern, how much longer
can you use flight magic?

69
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,777
It uses up a lot of mana,

70
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,570
so 30 minutes would be my limit.

71
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,074
We can't make it to town
in just 30 minutes.

72
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:26,867
Let's return to that village.

73
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,453
I'll carry Stark.

74
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:30,829
You're overreacting.

75
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:33,165
I'm fine.

76
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,460
Master used to say that poison
can be overcome with willpower.

77
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,796
That reminds me…

78
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:42,967
Even when he was hit by poisonous arrows
that could take down a dragon,

79
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,177
<i>Eisen was completely fine.</i>

80
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,222
<i>Heiter was absolutely speechless.</i>

81
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:50,140
-You see?
-Actually,

82
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,684
the fact that he was speechless

83
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:54,353
means Master Eisen was not normal.

84
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:58,232
And plus, according to Master Heiter,

85
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:00,985
20% of adventurer fatalities
are caused by poison.

86
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:03,070
Let's hurry.

87
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:07,992
I'm really fine.

88
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,124
It's too late.

89
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,293
In a few hours,
your brain will start to melt

90
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,546
and drain out from your nose.

91
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:22,339
And you'll die.

92
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,216
That's so scary!

93
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,469
There's nothing we can do, Father?

94
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:32,016
Normally, it is only treatable
in the early stages.

95
00:06:32,516 --> 00:06:34,727
But perhaps my little brother could…

96
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,855
Brother, do you have a second?

97
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:40,733
Isn't our new washing bowl
a little too small?

98
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,443
We have to live modestly.

99
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:43,944
This is going too far.

100
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:48,115
Nobody else makes things this miniature
just to live modestly.

101
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,661
More importantly, Sein,
take a look at this man.

102
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:56,373
Oh? These are the people

103
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:58,959
who saved me.

104
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,714
What? Did you get bitten
by a snake or something?

105
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:05,883
Didn't I say to be careful?

106
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,391
Well then, now we're even.

107
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,519
I'll go help out in the plaza.

108
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:19,605
All right.

109
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:22,608
My nosebleed

110
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,193
stopped.

111
00:07:25,444 --> 00:07:27,404
I don't detect any poison.

112
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:32,826
Father, that guy…

113
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:35,120
What are your thoughts

114
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:36,955
on my little brother?

115
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,919
That holy symbol
around your neck is something

116
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:46,757
the Holy City gives to the most
outstanding priest outside the city.

117
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:49,676
You must be an expert in healing.

118
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,971
But he instantly healed someone
whom you deemed incurable.

119
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,849
It must be a natural talent.

120
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,937
I knew you would be able to tell,
Mistress Frieren.

121
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,106
You know about me?

122
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:05,275
I heard about you from Master Heiter.

123
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:10,406
This holy symbol
was bestowed upon me by Master Heiter

124
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:13,033
who came here
on a visit from the Holy City.

125
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:17,037
But in the end, I am nothing
but a countryside priest.

126
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,291
This is the only thing
that I can be proud about.

127
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,709
On the other hand,

128
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:25,796
Sein's talent is on another level.

129
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:30,342
Our parents died early on.

130
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:33,429
So I raised my brother Sein,

131
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,556
who is much younger than me.

132
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:38,183
<i>When he was a child,</i>

133
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,311
<i>he used to always say</i>
<i>that he wanted to be an adventurer.</i>

134
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,772
He didn't want to be

135
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,235
a priest in an ordinary village like me
and do the same thing

136
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:49,695
day after day.

137
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,699
He told me that with eyes
filled with hopes and dreams.

138
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,204
But now, he resembles me when I was young.

139
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,249
He must be bored with life.

140
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,294
Please,

141
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:08,672
will you take him
out of this village for me?

142
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,467
I'm sure he has just been

143
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,553
waiting for someone to give him a nudge.

144
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,184
I'm for it, Frieren.

145
00:09:21,101 --> 00:09:23,187
It's not that hard of a decision.

146
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:28,442
I don't want to risk having my brain
come out of my nose anymore.

147
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,694
It's true that it may be safer

148
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:33,489
to have a priest with us from here on.

149
00:09:34,239 --> 00:09:36,575
Why are you against it, Mistress Frieren?

150
00:09:38,994 --> 00:09:41,705
Maybe it's an aversion to my own kind…

151
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:44,249
What are you talking about?

152
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,504
Anyway, I'll recruit him
even if I have to do it alone.

153
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:52,549
Where is he going?

154
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,095
Apparently, Master Sein spends
most of his time in the bar below.

155
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,847
What…

156
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,351
Drinking,

157
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:04,728
smoking,

158
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:06,855
gambling…

159
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:11,818
You can't get anymore corrupt than this.

160
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,446
This is how you deepen friendships.

161
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,031
Want to join, kid?

162
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,325
My name is Stark.

163
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,036
We're looking for a priest.

164
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:22,704
Want to come with us?

165
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,624
You must be joking.

166
00:10:26,124 --> 00:10:28,126
I'm a priest of this village.

167
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:30,170
Adventures aren't…

168
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,634
<i>Well, this may be interesting.</i>

169
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:37,844
Have a seat, Stark.

170
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,889
If you can beat me, I'll join your group.

171
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,767
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

172
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:49,356
Stop!

173
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,525
Mistress Frieren,

174
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:54,778
it sounds like Master Stark
is screaming from below.

175
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,039
He's been stripped of all his clothes!

176
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:09,126
How terrible. Who would do such a thing?

177
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:11,253
Don't blame me.

178
00:11:13,046 --> 00:11:16,466
Adults are all dirty
in one way or another.

179
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,011
He's been stripped of all his clothes too!

180
00:11:19,094 --> 00:11:21,305
The village chief won it all.

181
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:23,473
His skills were out of this world.

182
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,183
Sein…

183
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,477
I heard you're looking for another member?

184
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,770
Go find someone else.

185
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,648
You want to be an adventurer, right?

186
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:34,526
Like I said, that was a long time ago.

187
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,361
It's too late for that.

188
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:40,324
I should have followed after him
a long time ago.

189
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,037
Now I'm just a pathetic old man
in nothing but underwear.

190
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,374
Frieren,

191
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,669
let's take down the Demon King together.

192
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,046
It's too late for that.

193
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:58,050
I haven't fought an actual demon
in more than 500 years.

194
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:01,553
I've forgotten how to fight already.

195
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:05,557
I've held back
on making a decision for too long.

196
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,770
I was probably scared
of fighting the Demon King.

197
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:13,648
Too much time has passed
and there's no turning back.

198
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:17,319
So what, Frieren?

199
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,572
-I'm talking about "now."
-I'm talking about "now."

200
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,291
Find someone else.

201
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:34,252
You wouldn't know how I feel.

202
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,754
Is that right?

203
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,131
I can say for certain now.

204
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,926
I dislike you, after all.

205
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,930
Oh, yeah? Well then--

206
00:12:45,013 --> 00:12:48,016
So I will keep recruiting you
no matter how long it takes.

207
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:50,852
Why?

208
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:54,856
It's scary how much you don't make sense.

209
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,860
Thank you. It's so warm.

210
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:03,657
I am terribly sorry for all the trouble.

211
00:13:04,157 --> 00:13:05,283
Excuse me.

212
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,413
How much did you buy it for?

213
00:13:09,913 --> 00:13:12,749
He said, "It's almost the harvest festival
so enjoy your stay,"

214
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,544
and gave it back for free.

215
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:18,130
You're lucky they were nice people.

216
00:13:18,213 --> 00:13:20,507
They didn't know
how to get rid of the axe.

217
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,758
How sad…

218
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:24,511
Put these on, please.

219
00:13:25,512 --> 00:13:28,682
Why are you pinching it like
it's something dirty?

220
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,184
This is yours, Master Sein.

221
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,233
What did I do to deserve this treatment?

222
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,529
She's mad that you stripped Stark
of all his belongings.

223
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:46,032
It wasn't me, it was the village chief.

224
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,870
People who gamble are the worst.

225
00:13:49,953 --> 00:13:51,955
I'm sorry.

226
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:54,666
Not to mention, Master Sein is a priest.

227
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,252
What about priests who drink alcohol?

228
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,589
You don't know, Mistress Frieren?

229
00:14:01,089 --> 00:14:03,133
Alcohol is the best medicine.

230
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:06,511
Darn that Heiter…
What in the world did he teach you?

231
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:10,223
Whether or not he joins us aside,

232
00:14:10,932 --> 00:14:13,768
I think Sein should still
become an adventurer.

233
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:16,521
Why are you so cooperative
all of a sudden?

234
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:21,276
I just thought it'd be nice
to nudge someone once in a while.

235
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:24,404
Just as Himmel the Hero did.

236
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:29,910
<i>Apparently,</i>

237
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,329
<i>these adventurers</i>

238
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:35,165
<i>have decided to stay in the village.</i>

239
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:43,423
<i>Ever since that day,</i>
<i>they recruit me almost every day.</i>

240
00:14:47,385 --> 00:14:49,930
<i>Even when I tried to make them give up,</i>

241
00:14:50,013 --> 00:14:51,556
<i>it was to no avail.</i>

242
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:55,101
<i>With eyes filled with hopes and dreams,</i>

243
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,770
<i>just like his were,</i>

244
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,272
<i>they invite me to join their adventure.</i>

245
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:03,819
<i>I'm only going to go around</i>
<i>the northern lands a little.</i>

246
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:07,322
I'll be back by the harvest festival
in three years.

247
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:11,076
If you're not ready now,
I'll wait until then.

248
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,704
<i>Let's go on the next adventure together.</i>

249
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:18,917
<i>Every time they recruit me, I think,</i>

250
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:21,086
<i>"Why now, after all this time?"</i>

251
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:25,882
<i>All of that is too blinding for me now.</i>

252
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,345
What does Sein like?

253
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:32,764
We're having a hard time.

254
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,516
So we want tips.

255
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:36,101
Let's see…

256
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:38,854
Drinking, smoking, gambling…

257
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,897
We know that already.

258
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,899
Is he really a priest?

259
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,820
So Master Heiter
was an upstanding priest after all.

260
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,365
What counts as an "upstanding priest"?

261
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,075
Other than that,

262
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,870
he likes older ladies.

263
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:57,205
He's basically an apostate at this point.

264
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,708
Older ladies, huh?

265
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,961
Honestly though,
what can we do with that information?

266
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:07,340
What?

267
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:11,011
-Oh, that's right…
-Brother!

268
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:14,431
Isn't our new scythe a little too small?

269
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,766
We can't cut grass with this…

270
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,810
You guys again?

271
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:22,522
Can you give us a second?

272
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:23,899
You're still here?

273
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,025
Come on!

274
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:27,694
Look, how many times
do I have to tell you?

275
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:29,362
Go find someone else.

276
00:16:30,238 --> 00:16:31,531
Sein,

277
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:35,035
would you like to travel
with an older lady?

278
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,912
Are you stupid?

279
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,958
That is exactly why I wanted to become
an adventurer when I was a kid.

280
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,168
What a horrible motive.

281
00:16:43,251 --> 00:16:45,211
So, where is she?

282
00:16:45,712 --> 00:16:47,923
Where is this "older lady"?

283
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:50,133
Right here, Sein.

284
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,552
I am an elf.

285
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,680
I am a lady much older than you.

286
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:00,727
My brother mentioned
something like that before…

287
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,274
I refuse

288
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,069
to call that an older lady!

289
00:17:09,152 --> 00:17:10,570
He looks so distressed.

290
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:12,405
Oh, well…

291
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:16,409
To tell the truth,
I don't really like doing this, but…

292
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:22,707
It's time to show the seduction skills
that I learned from my master.

293
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:32,175
What was that?

294
00:17:33,134 --> 00:17:35,261
I blew you a kiss.

295
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,722
I guess it was too advanced
for a boy like you.

296
00:17:38,306 --> 00:17:41,184
Can somebody please take this child home?

297
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:43,019
That was too sexy!

298
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,437
What is up with you guys?

299
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,481
That's weird…

300
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:50,443
When I tested it on Himmel,
it was so effective that he fainted.

301
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,950
-Himmel!
-What a heartless woman.

302
00:17:57,575 --> 00:17:59,703
-How strange…
-I understand that feeling.

303
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:03,415
If I had taken a direct hit,
it would've knocked me out.

304
00:18:03,498 --> 00:18:05,875
I guess he really is a priest, after all.

305
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,795
-We've got ourselves a tough opponent.
-That's enough!

306
00:18:09,295 --> 00:18:12,340
I have no intention
of becoming an adventurer.

307
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,218
Don't you want to go after
your best friend?

308
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,471
Brother, you should understand.

309
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:20,932
Sein…

310
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:24,769
He said that he would
come back in three years.

311
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,522
But it's been ten years since then.

312
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,151
Obviously, he's dead already.

313
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,948
You're going to give up
without even finding him?

314
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,161
It's only been ten years.

315
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:45,248
If you don't go find him now,
you'll regret it in the near future.

316
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:49,169
You'll think,
"What if it wasn't too late?"

317
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,838
Why…

318
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:54,674
I bet you're thinking,
"Why now after all this time?"

319
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,636
I'm talking about what you can do "now,"

320
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:00,346
Sein.

321
00:19:05,518 --> 00:19:08,021
I can't go. It's for the same reason

322
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:11,357
I didn't go along with him ten years ago.

323
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,569
There's no way I could leave the village

324
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,238
and leave my brother behind.

325
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:20,366
What are you talking about, Sein?

326
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,704
When Master Heiter
came to visit from the Holy City,

327
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,872
I overheard you…

328
00:19:28,124 --> 00:19:30,001
Someone as talented as you

329
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:33,046
should have no problem
serving as a priest in the Holy City.

330
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:35,256
In the Holy City?

331
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:37,842
Yes, I'm sure of it.

332
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:42,514
Master Heiter, what would happen
to my little brother then?

333
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:44,849
He can come to the Holy City too.

334
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,352
I see.

335
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:52,107
Master Heiter, I appreciate the offer,

336
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:56,778
but I have no issues
with my life in this village.

337
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,281
My little brother lost his parents
when he was young.

338
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:03,034
As his older brother,

339
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:07,372
I can't possibly rob him
of his hometown as well.

340
00:20:11,334 --> 00:20:12,293
Is that so?

341
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,922
I understand your decision.

342
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,842
I guess I came here for nothing.

343
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:21,678
But since I'm here anyway,

344
00:20:22,345 --> 00:20:24,097
I'll have your little brother

345
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,725
listen to all the stories
from my adventures.

346
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,313
My brother stayed
in this village because of me.

347
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,652
Sein, that is what you were
thinking all this time?

348
00:20:40,905 --> 00:20:43,199
Don't act like we're the same!

349
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:47,453
I have never regretted my decision.
Not even once!

350
00:20:48,037 --> 00:20:50,165
Look at you, on the other hand.

351
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:52,959
How long do you plan to drown in regret?

352
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:54,752
I'm done with you.

353
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,854
I apologized to my brother.

354
00:21:15,398 --> 00:21:17,609
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

355
00:21:18,234 --> 00:21:19,611
He's really kind.

356
00:21:20,486 --> 00:21:22,572
He's never hit me before.

357
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,159
I'm the one who pushed him to that point.

358
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,662
I've never seen
that expression on his face.

359
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:38,421
Frieren, I've decided
to become an adventurer.

360
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,548
I'll chase after him.

361
00:21:41,966 --> 00:21:43,968
It's only been ten years, after all.

362
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:45,887
I see.

363
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:55,146
The objective of my journey
is to find him.

364
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,523
I will find him

365
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:00,860
and fulfill the silly dream
I had as a kid.

366
00:22:01,736 --> 00:22:03,446
So it's temporary.

367
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,907
I'll join you temporarily.

368
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,244
-I did it!
-You did it!

369
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,253
Bye!

370
00:22:19,128 --> 00:22:21,256
Have a safe trip!

371
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:28,763
By the way, what's the goal
of your journey?

372
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:30,139
Heaven.

373
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,767
Why go out of your way to travel there?

374
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:35,186
Anybody can go once you die.

375
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,397
Even you, Sein?

376
00:22:38,564 --> 00:22:41,776
Is it just me,
or is that girl really harsh?

377
00:22:42,276 --> 00:22:43,903
We can do this together.

378
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,116
What is going on?

379
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,167
<i>How do you deal with others?</i>

380
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,877
<i>I think I'd die.</i>

381
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,546
<i>-Let's go shopping.</i>
<i>-It's all about helping each other.</i>

382
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,590
<i>Do you hate me that much?</i>

383
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:29,884
<i>"Privilege of the Young".</i>

384
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:30,843
