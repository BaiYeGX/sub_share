ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

2
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,344
29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

3
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,847
LAUB HILLS IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

4
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,360
How long have you all been traveling?

5
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:54,321
Let's see…

6
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,366
I started my journey with Mistress Frieren

7
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,743
about four years ago.

8
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,328
It's been about a year for me.

9
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,374
I see.

10
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:13,883
You know, this party is missing something.

11
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,885
Guess what it is.

12
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,888
We have a vanguard,

13
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:21,474
mages, and a priest.

14
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:26,020
Perhaps a thief? After all,
Mistress Frieren always falls for mimics.

15
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:27,396
Oh goody!

16
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:30,149
Jeez…

17
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:34,028
Treasure chests
have endless possibilities.

18
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,404
You're wrong.

19
00:02:36,655 --> 00:02:38,699
You're missing something more important.

20
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,410
It's an older lady!

21
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,246
Any party has at least one!

22
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,916
A sexy, mature lady!

23
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,001
You think so?

24
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,879
But we have Frieren.

25
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:55,049
No! I don't consider her an older lady.

26
00:02:55,132 --> 00:02:57,885
-He looks so distraught.
-Well, excuse me.

27
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,181
L… Look, the next village is within sight.

28
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,991
They are breathing.

29
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,160
Yeah, over here too.

30
00:03:24,286 --> 00:03:27,164
What is going on? Everyone's sleeping.

31
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,211
This smells like trouble.

32
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:33,879
Let's go to the next village.

33
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,340
Mistress Frieren,
don't make me get mad at you.

34
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:37,842
I was just joking.

35
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,970
It's a curse.

36
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:43,514
I knew it… What a pain.

37
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,060
Hey, Frieren, what's a curse?

38
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,938
Some of the spells used by
monsters and demons

39
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:55,192
include ones that put people to sleep
or turn them into stone.

40
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:59,488
Among those spells, we refer to the ones
that mankind has yet to decipher

41
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,323
as "curses."

42
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:06,453
Mankind hasn't been able to figure out
how it works or how to break it.

43
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:09,915
So this village is beyond help?

44
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:13,586
Only in terms of "mankind's" magic.

45
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:17,673
The Magic of the Goddess,
used by priests, is another story.

46
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,303
Handling curses has always been
a priest's job.

47
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,681
How is it, Sein? Is there hope?

48
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,975
Don't rush me.

49
00:04:28,058 --> 00:04:30,644
I'm figuring out
the type and source of the curse.

50
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:38,319
How is the Magic of the Goddess
different from other magic?

51
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:42,489
The Magic of the Goddess
is recorded in the Scriptures,

52
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,825
so only those with the Scriptures
can use it.

53
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:48,287
Like the magic of demons,
most of the spells

54
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,080
aren't fully understood.

55
00:04:50,706 --> 00:04:53,334
That's why it's not that fun.

56
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,840
Plus, it's difficult to use
unless you're born with a natural gift.

57
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:04,345
That gift also makes the user
less susceptible to curses.

58
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,182
If I remember correctly,
it's called the Blessing of the Goddess.

59
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:11,852
That's why priests are generally
resistant to curses.

60
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,898
So even you can't defend yourself
against curses, Frieren?

61
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:19,568
Mages can't detect curses that well.

62
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:23,030
I can somewhat sense
that I am being attacked,

63
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:26,784
so I can at least tell that this village
is still under the curse.

64
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:28,535
I feel uneasy.

65
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,830
Are you saying that
we are being cursed as we speak?

66
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,831
How scary!

67
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,586
From what I can see,
it's a very unique curse.

68
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:39,588
You can't break the curse?

69
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:43,133
It will require a ritual and tools.

70
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,261
It'll be faster to
get rid of the source of the curse.

71
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,724
The source is a monster.
I know where it is already.

72
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,642
Let's go.

73
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,228
I like that he doesn't waste time.

74
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:58,899
Mistress Frieren.

75
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:01,110
Master Stark is…

76
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,990
Sleeping…

77
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:09,451
Can't you wake him up,
even just temporarily?

78
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,453
The spell that I can use now

79
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,164
will only keep him awake for five seconds.

80
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,417
It won't make much of a difference.

81
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:19,753
Anyway, it looks like
we don't have much time.

82
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:45,571
Fern isn't waking up.
I told her we were only resting a little…

83
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:48,240
Fern fell asleep too, huh?

84
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,784
We're in trouble now.

85
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:57,291
I put up a barrier. Let's hide them here.

86
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,715
We're close. I can sense it nearby.

87
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:10,095
Yeah? Then wake me up
when the monster appears.

88
00:07:11,513 --> 00:07:13,640
Don't fight it on your own.

89
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:15,851
I will defeat it no matter what.

90
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,396
Hey, my spell only works for five seconds…

91
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,524
Frieren?

92
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:26,320
What can you do in just five seconds?

93
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,121
Whatever…

94
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:39,124
I know some offensive magic myself.

95
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,103
<i>A subspecies of the Chaos Flower…</i>

96
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,564
<i>It was using the sleeping villagers</i>
<i>as fertilizer, huh?</i>

97
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:07,111
<i>It slowly sucks up their mana</i>
<i>and kills them.</i>

98
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:16,245
<i>Chaos Flowers breed with</i>
<i>plants native to the region they're in</i>

99
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:17,704
<i>to form subspecies.</i>

100
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,375
<i>It's almost like a mirror.</i>

101
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:22,960
<i>However,</i>

102
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:25,045
<i>no matter how much</i>
<i>their appearance changes,</i>

103
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,381
<i>their weak point</i>
<i>will always be their core.</i>

104
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,969
Three Spears of the Goddess!

105
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,146
<i>What just happened?</i>

106
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,150
<i>Did it reflect my spell?</i>

107
00:08:46,775 --> 00:08:48,652
<i>I have to pierce through the core</i>

108
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:52,781
<i>or else the leaves will reflect the spell</i>
<i>in random directions.</i>

109
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,118
<i>It may even hit Frieren.</i>

110
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,956
<i>Damn it!</i>
<i>This is only going to wear me out.</i>

111
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,875
<i>Should I just wake Frieren up?</i>

112
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,502
<i>But she was a mage in the party of heroes…</i>

113
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,504
<i>If her spell is reflected,</i>

114
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,506
<i>it may wipe out this forest</i>

115
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,508
<i>and even the village.</i>

116
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,763
<i>I only have five seconds.</i>
<i>There's no time to explain.</i>

117
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,682
<i>Plus, we haven't known each other</i>

118
00:09:18,765 --> 00:09:22,769
<i>long enough to build mutual trust</i>
<i>and good communication between us.</i>

119
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:27,274
<i>First of all, I can't even tell</i>
<i>what's going on in her mind.</i>

120
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,651
That's right.

121
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,989
I can't tell what's going on in her mind.

122
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,909
In my opinion,

123
00:09:36,992 --> 00:09:39,286
good communication and mutual trust

124
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:41,246
are not necessary for adventurers.

125
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,334
Frieren, my former comrade, was especially

126
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,127
unskilled in those areas.

127
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:53,217
So I decided to believe in her words.

128
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:58,096
She said that she would
defeat the Demon King no matter what.

129
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,725
And I believed those words.

130
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,394
<i>Believe her words, huh?</i>

131
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,737
Don't fight it on your own.

132
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,114
I will defeat it no matter what.

133
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,077
Boy, did she look dopey or what?

134
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,080
Don't blame me if this fails!

135
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,332
Awakening Spell.

136
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,254
Frieren! Aim at the core…

137
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,278
Okay, got it.

138
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,374
What is going on here?

139
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,878
Thank you so much.

140
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,881
We are forever indebted to you.

141
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:18,218
No, it wasn't that big of a deal.

142
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,137
It was.

143
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,639
Thanks to you, we woke up feeling amazing.

144
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,356
The moment I woke up,
I could just tell that it was

145
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,567
the type that reflects magic.

146
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:37,696
I guess you really are
an amazing mage, after all.

147
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:41,199
But Sein, we were able to
come out of this alive because of you.

148
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,785
Thank you.

149
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:50,459
Well done.

150
00:11:57,507 --> 00:12:00,218
That lady from the village was so pretty…

151
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,387
He's still talking about that…

152
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:05,140
So that's Vorig, huh?

153
00:12:05,223 --> 00:12:06,099
29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH
OF HIMMEL THE HERO,

154
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:07,100
FORTRESS CITY OF VORIG
IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

155
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,395
It's a stopover on the route
to Äußerst, the city of magic.

156
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,064
We're finally halfway there.

157
00:12:12,147 --> 00:12:13,023
NORTHERN LANDS
ÄUSSERST - VORIG - GRANAT

158
00:12:13,106 --> 00:12:14,858
<i>It really is a long journey, isn't it?</i>

159
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,653
Anyway, let's stock up
on materials in Vorig and…

160
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,447
Um, Mistress Frieren…

161
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:24,284
I hate to break it to you,
but we're out of funds.

162
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,661
-Hey, you there.
-What?

163
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,416
That's a noble's carriage.

164
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,171
What? What do you want?

165
00:12:37,255 --> 00:12:40,175
You're well-built
and not bad looking either.

166
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,803
Come to my mansion.

167
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:46,890
What is going on?

168
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,314
What is your name?

169
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,066
Stark.

170
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:59,736
Lord Orden, we can't have you doing this.

171
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,571
You know who I am?

172
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,533
This is the Orden Family's mansion,
one of the three great families

173
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,368
in the northern lands.

174
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:09,204
Your grandfather was also very pushy.

175
00:13:09,287 --> 00:13:12,791
What kind of nonsense
are you talking about?

176
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:16,211
In any case,
I am speaking with Stark right now.

177
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,964
He's the vanguard of my party.

178
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,092
Stark,

179
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:25,679
do I need permission from your mommy
to speak to you?

180
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:27,097
Don't fight…

181
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,725
I have a request and I'm willing to pay.

182
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,478
This is ridiculous. Let's go, Stark.

183
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,272
Mistress Frieren…

184
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,653
What about these copper coins?

185
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:43,738
It's our remaining traveling funds.

186
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,827
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to hear you out, at least.

187
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,620
Frieren…

188
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:56,626
Stark, where did you come from?

189
00:13:57,377 --> 00:14:00,005
A village of warriors in the Klee region
in the central lands.

190
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:01,882
I see.

191
00:14:01,965 --> 00:14:04,634
My family was originally from
that village as well.

192
00:14:10,265 --> 00:14:11,892
This is my eldest son, Wirt.

193
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:16,146
He is my heir and a hero of this city.

194
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,191
He looks like Master Stark.

195
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:21,151
They're identical.

196
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,320
If you brush yourself up,

197
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:26,031
nobody other than family
will notice a difference.

198
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,493
Is that somehow related to your request?

199
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:35,081
One month ago,
we had a major battle against the demons.

200
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,876
And Wirt died on the battlefield.

201
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:40,420
He took down the enemy general
in the process.

202
00:14:41,671 --> 00:14:43,423
<i>The silver lining is that</i>

203
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,009
<i>it was a large scale, chaotic battle.</i>

204
00:14:47,594 --> 00:14:51,306
The only ones who know about
Wirt's death is Gabel, over there,

205
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:53,266
and a few confidantes.

206
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,439
What are you planning to make Stark do?

207
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,486
This Fortress City of Vorig

208
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,571
is this region's key defense line.

209
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,658
Until we get our army back on its feet,

210
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,827
we can't weaken their morale.

211
00:15:12,619 --> 00:15:15,580
So you're going to hide
your son's death until then?

212
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:18,083
In three months,

213
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:21,962
<i>there will be a social gathering</i>
<i>with influential people from this region.</i>

214
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:24,464
<i>There, we will show that Wirt</i>
<i>is alive and well.</i>

215
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,466
How much is the reward?

216
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,343
Ten Strahl gold coins.

217
00:15:29,177 --> 00:15:32,180
That'll hold us for a year
with three meals a day, plus snacks.

218
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,765
Add on a grimoire.

219
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,852
Take whichever one you like
from the library.

220
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,604
Wait a second! It's impossible.

221
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,690
What about the scar on my forehead?

222
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:43,608
We've already told the people

223
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,236
that Wirt is recuperating at the moment.

224
00:15:46,736 --> 00:15:48,697
That'll be an honorable battle scar.

225
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:53,785
Master Stark,
this is for our traveling funds.

226
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,579
How depressing…

227
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,457
Gabel, hammer some etiquette into Stark.

228
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:29,654
Master Stark,
how are your etiquette lessons going?

229
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,864
It's torture.

230
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:40,624
What do you think?

231
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,502
-It doesn't suit you.
-How mean.

232
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,298
I'll go get some fresh air.

233
00:16:56,139 --> 00:16:57,349
Lord Orden.

234
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,812
Like I've said over and over again,
call me "father."

235
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,023
You never know who is watching.

236
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,484
Aren't you a little too coldhearted?

237
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,363
It hasn't even been two months
since your son died.

238
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,200
I am only fulfilling my son's dying wish.

239
00:17:15,825 --> 00:17:17,744
We've had other body doubles.

240
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,164
They didn't look as similar as you though.

241
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:26,378
I agree, it's not the best feeling ever.

242
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,341
But this is my son's wish.

243
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,718
You'll have to bear with me.

244
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,932
Why can't you be more honest?

245
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:46,356
Mut, keep your back straight.

246
00:17:46,439 --> 00:17:48,191
Yes, Father.

247
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:50,944
He's my second son, Mut.

248
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:54,823
He is going to be my heir,
and yet he's not progressing at all.

249
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:59,285
Stark, on the other hand,
is such a failure.

250
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,918
Your posture says a lot
about your swordsmanship.

251
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,421
So I will teach you
the Orden Family's swordsmanship.

252
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:15,885
What's wrong?

253
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,269
Don't worry. Take a deep breath.

254
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,773
This isn't the village where you grew up.

255
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,945
Lord Orden, what is your opinion of Mut?

256
00:18:34,612 --> 00:18:36,239
He's not talented like his brother.

257
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,826
But he's a hard worker.

258
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,830
The work you put into it
will always pay off.

259
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,625
One day, he will become a knight
that is stronger than me.

260
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,586
I see.

261
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,630
You should tell Mut that.

262
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,632
I always tell him.

263
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:58,178
That's why he gets cocky
and doesn't progress.

264
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:01,890
That's a problem.

265
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,558
What?

266
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,519
I need to take etiquette lessons too?

267
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,646
It's a social gathering.

268
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,776
Do you really think
a man who is of age will go alone?

269
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:17,197
Or will his mommy escort him?

270
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,283
Do your best.

271
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,611
This past month was absolute torture.

272
00:19:58,029 --> 00:19:59,823
It's for our traveling funds, right?

273
00:19:59,906 --> 00:20:02,158
I'm sorry…

274
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,587
Might as well dance,
since we learned how to.

275
00:20:16,422 --> 00:20:18,466
It really doesn't suit you at all.

276
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:29,913
Shall we dance too?

277
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,874
I'm eating cake.

278
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,085
Is that so…

279
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,009
If it wasn't for my injury,

280
00:21:43,092 --> 00:21:45,887
it would have been me on the frontline.

281
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:49,015
Perhaps Wirt wouldn't have died.

282
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:50,642
My lord…

283
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,940
It seems the gathering has ended.

284
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:01,194
You've completed my request.

285
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:05,365
Gabel, give Frieren their reward for me.

286
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:18,294
Stark, you are stunningly skilled
as a warrior.

287
00:22:19,045 --> 00:22:20,213
If you want to…

288
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:23,174
I can't replace your son.

289
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,343
You're right…

290
00:22:26,302 --> 00:22:29,472
Just as I cannot replace your father.

291
00:22:30,264 --> 00:22:32,684
But you have no place
to return to, do you?

292
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,980
The village of warriors in the Klee region
was wiped out by demons.

293
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:38,356
I know that much.

294
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,069
My final words with my son
were an argument.

295
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:45,863
We quarreled over something trivial.

296
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,951
<i>"I don't want to</i>
<i>see your face ever again."</i>

297
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:51,452
<i>I just blurted that out.</i>

298
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:55,456
I didn't even mean those words.

299
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,755
When I found you,
I thought it was a miracle.

300
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:08,678
Well then, even more so,
I can't stay here.

301
00:23:10,304 --> 00:23:12,765
I also said something that I didn't mean

302
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:15,351
<i>to my foster parent.</i>

303
00:23:16,602 --> 00:23:17,645
That's why

304
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:21,232
I have to bring him back
lots of stories from my adventures.

305
00:23:23,818 --> 00:23:24,986
I see.

306
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,661
Which grimoire should I choose
for our reward?

307
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:37,415
Mistress Frieren,
it's already been half a day.

308
00:23:38,332 --> 00:23:39,792
You're troubling Master Gabel.

309
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:42,295
Hurry up…

310
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,798
Look, he looks completely lifeless.

311
00:23:46,841 --> 00:23:50,344
{\an8}Seems like it will take
much more time to rebuild their army.

312
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:54,807
{\an8}What's wrong?

313
00:23:57,393 --> 00:23:58,436
Nothing…

314
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,733
{\an8}At least they won't

315
00:24:04,233 --> 00:24:06,402
{\an8}have any issue with finding an heir.

316
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,211
<i>-A forgotten hero, huh?</i>
<i>-I don't know the name.</i>

317
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:25,505
<i>-A forgotten hero.</i>
<i>-You must've been lonely.</i>

318
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:27,799
<i>Humans mature so fast.</i>

319
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,884
"<i>Long-lived Friends.</i>"

320
