ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

2
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:32,883
28 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

3
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,845
THE GRANZ CHANNEL IN THE CENTRAL LANDS

4
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,515
This place has always been

5
00:01:39,598 --> 00:01:41,726
a dangerous area to navigate by ship.

6
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:44,520
So all sorts of things wash up here.

7
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,940
Everyone in the village used to

8
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,859
get together to clean it up but…

9
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:52,862
You ran out of people
and this was left alone?

10
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,073
Before, it used to be a beautiful beach

11
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,867
with transparent water.

12
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,494
I know.

13
00:02:03,664 --> 00:02:06,250
Will this do as a reward?

14
00:02:09,503 --> 00:02:12,298
The Great Mage Flamme's book, huh?

15
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,216
Mistress Frieren…

16
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:17,428
Is this the only grimoire in this village?

17
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,846
Yes.

18
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,723
Okay.

19
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:23,142
I'll accept your cleanup request.

20
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:30,357
That grimoire is fake, right?

21
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:33,402
You've been studying like I told you to.

22
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:34,695
Good job, Fern.

23
00:02:35,529 --> 00:02:38,032
Books by Flamme are all fake.

24
00:02:38,574 --> 00:02:40,534
This is another poorly made fake.

25
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,870
Why did you accept it then?

26
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,373
There are people in need of help.

27
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,335
I don't think it's just out of kindness.

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,089
You're right, this is for myself.

29
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,428
Seems like we're going
to be here for a while.

30
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,696
As always, thank you, Fern.

31
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,115
I added one extra on the house.

32
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,742
Thank you.

33
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,078
It's been three months already.

34
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:26,956
-Have you gotten used to the village?
-Yes.

35
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,084
The coast is very chilly
this time of year,

36
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:31,836
so be careful.

37
00:03:36,298 --> 00:03:37,591
<i>It's winter already.</i>

38
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,515
She's still sleeping.

39
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,476
This place is a mess.

40
00:03:48,227 --> 00:03:50,521
I just cleaned it up yesterday.

41
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:56,235
Mistress Frieren, it's morning.
Please wake up.

42
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:09,582
Let's go clean the coast.

43
00:04:33,814 --> 00:04:35,149
It's freezing.

44
00:04:37,693 --> 00:04:39,403
I was thinking…

45
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:40,946
What?

46
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,741
Mistress Frieren, are you perhaps

47
00:04:43,824 --> 00:04:46,410
a very slobbish person?

48
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,747
Every morning, I wake you up,

49
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,916
feed you, and clothe you.

50
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,920
I'm basically your mother.

51
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:58,130
I can do it on my own.

52
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,508
But then you would be sleeping
until the afternoon.

53
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:02,927
Yeah.

54
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,388
Well, whatever. I've given up already.

55
00:05:06,972 --> 00:05:08,015
Sorry.

56
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:11,852
How were you traveling
as the party of heroes?

57
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:15,356
There was nobody to
take care of you, right?

58
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,399
I always overslept.

59
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,819
They didn't get mad at you?

60
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,489
They did, just once.

61
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,616
Just once?

62
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,827
They must've been very kind.

63
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,663
They were very tolerant.

64
00:05:31,413 --> 00:05:34,166
Once in a while,
Heiter would click his tongue though.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,918
Sorry.

66
00:05:36,543 --> 00:05:38,963
-Hey…
-I don't blame you though.

67
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,424
I think they were pretty mad.

68
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,564
How is the cleaning going?

69
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,068
There's about one-third of it left.

70
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:04,905
Will you make it in time
for the New Year's celebration?

71
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,156
Just barely.

72
00:06:06,782 --> 00:06:08,993
Well then, I really hope

73
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,620
you are able to watch
the sunrise this time,

74
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,080
Mistress Frieren.

75
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,465
What's the connection between

76
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,176
cleaning the coast and New Year's?

77
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,054
In this village, they have a custom

78
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,473
of watching the sunrise on New Year's Day.

79
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:35,310
The sunlight reflects off of
the transparent ocean

80
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,354
and it's very pretty, apparently.

81
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:40,357
You didn't see it, Mistress Frieren?

82
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,985
Do you think I'd be able to wake up?

83
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,487
I guess not.

84
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:49,074
Let's hurry. We don't have much time.

85
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,700
The water quality is good too.

86
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,828
We somehow finished a day before.

87
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:37,664
It looks nothing like before.

88
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:41,418
You're a life saver, Mistress Frieren.

89
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,089
You will participate
in the New Year's celebration, right?

90
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,006
Yeah.

91
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,258
We look forward to seeing you there.

92
00:07:49,593 --> 00:07:52,137
Have you gone insane, Mistress Frieren?

93
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,515
You have to wake up before the sun rises.

94
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:56,225
It's impossible.

95
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,894
I'll stay up all night, so it's fine.

96
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:01,772
You want to watch the sunrise that much?

97
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,316
Honestly, it doesn't interest me at all.

98
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,777
But that's why I have to check it out.

99
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:09,446
I don't really understand.

100
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,198
Yeah…

101
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:23,043
Why didn't you come to
the New Year's celebration?

102
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,172
Heiter is so disappointed,
he can't get out of bed.

103
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,298
Poor thing.

104
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,635
He's just out of commission
because he drank too much.

105
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:34,930
All of you made it, so who cares?

106
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,890
We wanted

107
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,268
you to enjoy it too.

108
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,645
It's just a sunrise.

109
00:08:41,728 --> 00:08:43,689
There's nothing to enjoy.

110
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,400
No, you'd enjoy it.

111
00:08:46,483 --> 00:08:47,401
Why?

112
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,821
Because that's the kind of person you are.

113
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,826
She's sleeping…

114
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,165
She's sleeping! Wake up, Mistress Frieren!

115
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:02,958
You'll miss the New Year's celebration!

116
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:06,712
-Mom…
-I'm not your mother!

117
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,216
Why do I have to do this?

118
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,430
Thank you, Fern.

119
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,112
<i>It's pretty, that's for sure.</i>

120
00:09:32,696 --> 00:09:35,115
<i>But it's not worth waking up so early.</i>

121
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,869
<i>Himmel doesn't know me at all.</i>

122
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,997
Fern, I'll go back to sleep…

123
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,877
Mistress Frieren, it's so beautiful.

124
00:09:48,545 --> 00:09:49,880
You think so?

125
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:52,674
It's just a sunrise.

126
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:57,846
But you look like you're having fun,
Mistress Frieren.

127
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,767
Well, that's because you were smiling…

128
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:11,902
I couldn't have

129
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,987
seen this sunrise on my own.

130
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:16,156
Of course.

131
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,535
You can't wake up on your own, after all.

132
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:23,747
{\an8}THE LAND WHERE SOULS REST

133
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,251
This is your family?

134
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:29,419
It was a long time ago.

135
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,798
My village was attacked by demons.

136
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:37,344
What are you doing?

137
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,930
I'm praying.

138
00:10:40,013 --> 00:10:42,808
People go back to nothing when they die.

139
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:44,768
They go to heaven.

140
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:47,688
Until a few thousand years ago,
most people

141
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:49,856
believed that you go back to nothing.

142
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,609
And dwarves value tradition.

143
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:56,446
But I'm skeptical about heaven too.

144
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,615
With the current level of magic,

145
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,243
we can't observe souls after they die.

146
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,162
So we can't prove its existence.

147
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,748
I don't really care, either way.

148
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:08,500
I agree.

149
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,753
I don't care whether it exists or not.

150
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,257
Is a priest allowed to say that?
Are you a corrupt priest?

151
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:18,927
But even if it doesn't exist,

152
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,179
I believe it should.

153
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,389
Why?

154
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:25,559
Because it's more convenient that way.

155
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:29,313
If people try so desperately to live
only to become

156
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:31,606
nothing in the end, that's just not right.

157
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,109
I'd rather believe that

158
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,154
they are living lavish lives in heaven.

159
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:38,864
I like that better.

160
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,245
It's definitely more convenient.

161
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:46,913
I guess I'll pray.

162
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,999
Yeah.

163
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:01,470
28 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO
THE BREDT REGION IN THE CENTRAL LANDS

164
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:06,641
Eisen, I came to visit.

165
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:10,896
That's how you greet someone you see
for the first time in 30 years?

166
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,523
It's only been 30 years.

167
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:17,361
I guess so.

168
00:12:18,945 --> 00:12:22,282
I can't believe you took in an apprentice.

169
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,119
Eisen, is there anything

170
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,412
you need help with?

171
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:30,707
Frieren, I heard you asked

172
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,335
the same thing to Heiter.

173
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,046
It's still not my time.

174
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,173
How did you know?

175
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,093
<i>Because we wrote to each other.</i>

176
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:43,428
<i>You're quite loyal despite your looks.</i>

177
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:46,932
You're too cold, that's all.

178
00:12:47,015 --> 00:12:50,602
And so, is there anything
you need help with?

179
00:12:54,314 --> 00:12:57,359
Voll Basin, huh? Brings back memories.

180
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,862
-You've been here before?
-Yeah, a long time ago.

181
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:03,782
She said "a long time ago."

182
00:13:03,865 --> 00:13:05,325
How long ago is that?

183
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,662
Primitive times?

184
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:11,331
I'm not that old.

185
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,169
So, what are you looking for?

186
00:13:16,878 --> 00:13:19,840
Great Flamme Mage's Notes.

187
00:13:22,008 --> 00:13:23,635
All right…

188
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:26,346
Most of Flamme's books are fake.

189
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,181
I have a clue.

190
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:31,017
<i>Heiter compiled Flamme's records</i>

191
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,603
<i>that were preserved in the Holy City</i>

192
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:35,439
<i>and discovered this location.</i>

193
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:40,026
<i>Her real notes are somewhere</i>
<i>in the Voll Basin.</i>

194
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,489
Frieren, you should know.

195
00:13:45,532 --> 00:13:47,200
That corrupt priest…

196
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,453
He researched that much?

197
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,040
Fine. Let's find a large tree first.

198
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:56,209
A large tree?

199
00:13:56,793 --> 00:13:59,796
That'll be endless. There are so many.

200
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,259
Well, I guess you have lots of time.

201
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:05,302
Yeah.

202
00:14:06,052 --> 00:14:09,222
But Fern will get mad,
so let's get it done quickly.

203
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,228
Let's search as efficiently as possible.

204
00:14:18,064 --> 00:14:19,316
You've changed.

205
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,235
You never used to

206
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,362
care about other people's time.

207
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:27,741
Well, Fern is scary when she gets mad.

208
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,661
I see. I'll watch out then.

209
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:06,655
Mistress Frieren,

210
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:08,657
there was a large tree

211
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,992
engulfing some ruins in the west.

212
00:15:12,035 --> 00:15:12,869
This way.

213
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:14,746
Okay.

214
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,212
Hey, why did you decide to search
for Flamme's Notes?

215
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,715
I felt pity.

216
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,427
I felt pity

217
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,638
for you and Himmel.

218
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,766
<i>On that day, 30 years ago,</i>

219
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,645
<i>you said that you wished</i>
<i>you knew more about Himmel.</i>

220
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:41,398
Those words are something

221
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,900
you should tell him directly.

222
00:15:45,443 --> 00:15:48,363
They say that Great Flamme Mage's Notes

223
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:50,240
include records of

224
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:52,784
her communicating with the dead.

225
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,161
That's just a fairy tale.

226
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,039
Plus, it's not like
I want to see him again.

227
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,458
Every magic spell

228
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,377
started out as a fairy tale.

229
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,422
Plus, you want to
get to know Himmel, right?

230
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:09,426
That's why I talked to Heiter.

231
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,929
I knew you were probably feeling regret,

232
00:16:13,763 --> 00:16:15,640
so I wanted to help you out.

233
00:16:24,941 --> 00:16:27,694
Mistress Frieren, the tree and the ruins

234
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:30,196
are protected by a strong barrier.

235
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,410
Since 1,000 years ago,

236
00:16:36,077 --> 00:16:39,122
I've been in the palm of her hand.

237
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:43,376
What an unreliable guard.

238
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:45,670
Not really.

239
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:49,424
Once this matures,

240
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:52,469
it will protect this place
even after 1,000 years.

241
00:16:53,136 --> 00:16:55,430
You'll be dead by then.

242
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,600
But not you.

243
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:02,479
One day, you will make a big mistake

244
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:05,106
and desire to know more about humans.

245
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,944
You want me to know more?
You're attention hungry?

246
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:10,403
That's not it.

247
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:13,615
I'm telling you to come here
when that time comes.

248
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,368
I'll help you out

249
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:18,370
as the Great Mage

250
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:19,871
Flamme.

251
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,138
That's Great Flamme Mage's Notes?

252
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,308
Are they real?

253
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,102
They're real.

254
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,145
How do you know?

255
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:47,607
Frieren was Flamme's top apprentice.

256
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,652
The Great Mage Flamme

257
00:17:50,735 --> 00:17:53,655
is an ancient hero in history books.

258
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,617
Is she seriously from primitive times?

259
00:17:58,201 --> 00:18:01,162
Are there records of her
communicating with the dead?

260
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,624
It was kindly opened to that page already.

261
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:08,211
<i>She knew 1,000 years ago</i>

262
00:18:08,294 --> 00:18:09,879
<i>I would come here?</i>

263
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,882
<i>As always, she's so obnoxious.</i>

264
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,886
<i>"In the northernmost point</i>
<i>of the continent…"</i>

265
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,139
<i>…I reached Aureole,</i>

266
00:18:19,222 --> 00:18:20,932
<i>the land where souls rest,</i>

267
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,226
<i>a place which the people</i>

268
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,228
<i>of this world call heaven.</i>

269
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,982
<i>There were many souls gathered there</i>

270
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:32,360
<i>and I talked to my former comrades.</i>

271
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,032
<i>This great discovery</i>

272
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,408
<i>will advance the study…</i>

273
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:40,577
"…of souls in leaps and bounds."

274
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,748
Is this true?

275
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:47,834
Who knows? She was pretty irresponsible.

276
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:50,045
Heaven does exist.

277
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:53,548
It's more convenient that way, isn't it?

278
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,259
That's right.

279
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,928
I guess I should believe once in a while.

280
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,974
I wonder where it is, specifically.

281
00:19:03,641 --> 00:19:04,976
One second…

282
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,855
North of the continent, Ende.

283
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,941
-Ende?
-Yeah…

284
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,987
<i>It's where the Demon King's castle is now.</i>

285
00:19:18,531 --> 00:19:20,283
Why there?

286
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:22,285
Frieren,

287
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:27,040
find Aureole and talk to Himmel.

288
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:31,836
You said you'd help me, right?

289
00:19:34,422 --> 00:19:36,841
You've become crafty, Eisen.

290
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,594
Thanks to Heiter.

291
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,807
Fine. It's not like my journey
had a goal or anything.

292
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,102
But it's extremely cold

293
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,229
around the Demon King's castle.

294
00:19:50,396 --> 00:19:52,315
I don't want to go…

295
00:19:53,024 --> 00:19:55,401
<i>She's already losing enthusiasm.</i>

296
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:04,285
-She fell asleep.
-What a carefree person.

297
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:08,790
So cold… I don't want to go…

298
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:10,166
She's having nightmares.

299
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,837
Is it that cold
around the Demon King's castle?

300
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:20,218
<i>Ende, where the Demon King's castle is,</i>

301
00:20:20,301 --> 00:20:23,054
<i>is the northernmost part of the continent.</i>

302
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,975
Plus, a lot went down over there.

303
00:20:28,184 --> 00:20:29,561
A lot?

304
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,278
<i>This is a bit awkward.</i>

305
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,906
<i>Maybe it's time to wake her up?</i>

306
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:46,286
Mistress Frieren!

307
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:51,040
That didn't work.

308
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:52,750
Hey, Fern.

309
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:56,379
Is she a good master?

310
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,715
I wonder…

311
00:20:59,465 --> 00:21:00,925
I don't really know.

312
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:04,220
She is just traveling in pursuit of magic

313
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,890
<i>and I'm always dragged around.</i>

314
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,100
<i>However,</i>

315
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,270
<i>she does seem interested in learning about</i>

316
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:13,855
<i>Master Himmel and the others.</i>

317
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:16,441
Maybe

318
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:19,444
she just doesn't have much interest in me.

319
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,114
Mistress Frieren
only made me her apprentice

320
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,659
<i>because of a promise she made</i>
<i>with Master Heiter.</i>

321
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:29,704
I see.

322
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:33,958
It's just that,
she's a very strange person.

323
00:21:34,667 --> 00:21:36,252
Once we started traveling,

324
00:21:36,836 --> 00:21:39,756
<i>she would give me birthday presents.</i>

325
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,759
<i>Even though she always seems</i>
<i>uninterested in me.</i>

326
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,763
I wonder what she's thinking.

327
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,514
She's so strange.

328
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,774
Frieren, you're not staying
in the royal capital?

329
00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:00,068
I'll continue traveling.

330
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:01,486
On your own?

331
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:02,862
It's easier that way.

332
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:06,199
You're not going to take an apprentice?

333
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:09,035
It's better to have someone
to talk to when traveling.

334
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,829
It's a waste of time.

335
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,540
Even if I teach them things,
they die right away.

336
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:21,422
Frieren, that's not what
interacting with people is about.

337
00:22:22,006 --> 00:22:23,883
It is.

338
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,885
My adventures with all of you

339
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,805
don't even make up
one-hundredth of my life.

340
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,432
You understand me, right?

341
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,892
I…

342
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:38,189
All right! No more gloomy topics!

343
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:40,733
Today is a joyous day, after all!

344
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,068
Let's drink!

345
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:44,904
You just want a reason to drink.

346
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,447
You got me.

347
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,033
You're always drinking anyway.

348
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,743
Corrupt Priest.

349
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,916
Fern,

350
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,836
Frieren is a good master.

351
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,756
I guess so.

352
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:10,680
Eisen, you really won't come with us?

353
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:14,475
Yeah. I told you before, didn't I?

354
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,853
I'll only be a burden.

355
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:19,063
Okay.

356
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,649
You remember how to get

357
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,317
to Ende, right?

358
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,070
Yeah. First go to the Wille region,

359
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:28,114
then pass through Riegel Canyon

360
00:23:28,197 --> 00:23:30,158
and the checkpoint to the northern lands.

361
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,497
Sorry, it will be a long journey.

362
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:39,584
It took us ten years.

363
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:42,962
I see…

364
