ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

2
00:01:29,922 --> 00:01:33,217
THE NORTHERNMOST POINT OF THE CONTINENT

3
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,679
I REACHED AUREOLE,
THE LAND WHERE SOULS REST,

4
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:39,598
A PLACE WHICH
THE PEOPLE OF THIS WORLD CALL HEAVEN

5
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,768
{\an8}THERE WERE MANY SOULS GATHERED THERE

6
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,105
{\an8}AND I TALKED TO MY FORMER COMRADES

7
00:01:46,188 --> 00:01:47,857
THE GREAT MAGE FLAMME

8
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,870
Frieren.

9
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,463
The royal capital is within sight now.

10
00:02:10,546 --> 00:02:13,340
The party of heroes is making
a triumphant return home.

11
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,092
I bet they're filled with excitement.

12
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,930
Once we get back,
I have to look for a job.

13
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:22,850
You're thinking about that already?

14
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,935
It's important.

15
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:28,105
It doesn't end
just because we took down the Demon King.

16
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:31,025
We have our whole lives ahead of us.

17
00:02:31,942 --> 00:02:35,780
-A job, huh?
-I want a job where I can drink.

18
00:02:35,863 --> 00:02:37,573
Excuse me, you're a priest.

19
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,577
That's true…

20
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,331
Frieren,

21
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:49,668
you are probably going to
live for so much longer

22
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,295
than we can even imagine.

23
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,839
Maybe.

24
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,336
Himmel, the hero.

25
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,840
Eisen, the warrior. Heiter, the priest.

26
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,843
Frieren, the mage.

27
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:42,596
You did well in taking down
the Demon King.

28
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:47,852
Now, an era of peace
will come upon this world.

29
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:07,371
The king is apparently going to
erect statues of us in the plaza.

30
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:12,251
Although, I'm still very skeptical
whether they can accurately depict

31
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:14,170
how handsome I am.

32
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,881
What a self-serving man, that king.

33
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:20,301
He's the one who only gave us
ten copper coins when we departed.

34
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,971
Now, now, Frieren.

35
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:26,056
Now we get to drink for free.

36
00:04:26,807 --> 00:04:28,642
Let's call it a deal.

37
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,311
Corrupt Priest.

38
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,070
So it's over, huh?

39
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:42,072
Yeah.

40
00:04:43,073 --> 00:04:45,451
Our adventure ends here.

41
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:47,745
Ten years, huh?

42
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:50,831
So many things happened.

43
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,250
<i>Like the day we departed…</i>

44
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,336
<i>when Himmel and Eisen</i>

45
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:58,339
<i>spoke disrespectfully to the king</i>
<i>and were almost executed.</i>

46
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:01,800
In the worst-case scenario,
our adventure could have ended there.

47
00:05:02,968 --> 00:05:06,430
There was that time when Heiter
was useless because of a hangover.

48
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:14,480
You look like an undead, but are you okay?

49
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:17,107
-I'm not.
-You're not, huh?

50
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,235
<i>He was like that at least once a week.</i>

51
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,237
Compared to that, I'm a model student.

52
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,074
<i>When you were almost eaten by a mimic,</i>
<i>we thought about leaving you behind.</i>

53
00:05:25,157 --> 00:05:28,285
How many times did we say
that it was a trap? Seriously?

54
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,954
Can we leave this elf behind?

55
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,377
Jeez…

56
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,212
We only have lousy memories.

57
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:41,215
But it was fun.

58
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:45,094
I'm glad I was able to
go on an adventure with you all.

59
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,221
I agree.

60
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:49,848
Although it was only a short while.

61
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,978
Short? What are you talking about?
It was ten years.

62
00:05:54,603 --> 00:05:57,982
Look at Heiter.
He's become such an old man.

63
00:05:58,065 --> 00:06:01,110
-That's rude.
-He was always like that.

64
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:02,319
That's rude.

65
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,078
It's about time.

66
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,588
The Era Meteor Shower, was it?

67
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:25,467
A meteor shower that happens
once every 50 years.

68
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,346
It's a perfect start to an era of peace.

69
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:34,268
How beautiful.

70
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:36,520
It's hard to see
in the middle of the city.

71
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:39,606
We're getting emotional over here.
Can you try to read the mood?

72
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,110
Then, next time…

73
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:49,366
In 50 years, I'll show you to a place
that I know with a better view.

74
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,913
-What?
-No…

75
00:06:55,664 --> 00:06:56,915
It's nothing.

76
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,920
Okay, let's all go to see it.

77
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,861
All right, I'm going this way.

78
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,113
What are you going to do now?

79
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:31,325
I'll continue my pursuit of magic.

80
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:34,703
I plan to travel around the central lands
for about 100 years.

81
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,081
So, I'll visit from time to time.

82
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,838
An elf's perception of time
is unfathomable.

83
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,466
Seriously, how long has she been alive?

84
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,135
I bet to her,

85
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,472
50 years and 100 years
don't make much of a difference.

86
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,774
A shadow dragon's horn?

87
00:08:46,358 --> 00:08:48,444
We don't sell that here.

88
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:52,823
I haven't seen a shadow dragon around
for two to three decades.

89
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:56,869
I see. What should I do…?
I need it to summon…

90
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:02,249
<i>That reminds me,</i>
<i>I entrusted the one I found</i>

91
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,877
<i>in the Demon King's castle to Himmel.</i>

92
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,964
Um, it's exuding some kind of evil aura.

93
00:09:09,047 --> 00:09:10,841
It's not harmful, is it?

94
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:13,760
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

95
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:17,222
<i>It's almost time</i>
<i>for the Era Meteor Shower anyway.</i>

96
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:18,765
<i>I guess I'll go get it.</i>

97
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:28,525
<i>The townscape is quite different</i>
<i>from the last time I was here.</i>

98
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,708
It should be around here.

99
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:46,710
Frieren?

100
00:09:47,836 --> 00:09:48,962
Himmel…

101
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:58,222
-You're a feeble old man…
-Well, that's rude.

102
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,561
I've grown old,
but I'm still handsome, aren't I?

103
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:08,106
It's been 50 years.

104
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,734
You look just like you did back then.

105
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,239
I thought I would never see you again.

106
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,243
The Era Meteor Shower, huh?

107
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,620
That brings back memories.

108
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:24,498
Also, about that thing I found
in the Demon King's castle…

109
00:10:24,581 --> 00:10:26,625
The shadow dragon's horn, right?

110
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:30,420
Not a day went by
without me thinking about it.

111
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,882
After all, there was constantly
an evil aura coming out of the drawer.

112
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:35,634
Sorry about that…

113
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,180
You could've just tossed it
into a shed or something.

114
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,809
How could I do that?

115
00:10:46,853 --> 00:10:51,817
You may have left it with me
without much thought,

116
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,193
but to me,

117
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:57,406
it was something important that was
entrusted to me by a special comrade.

118
00:10:57,489 --> 00:11:01,034
It was something I needed to
return to you one day, just like this.

119
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:12,587
It's really not that important.

120
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,734
Himmel, are you ready?

121
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:37,446
You're bald,
so there's no point in caring too much.

122
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:40,741
Bald people still have their preferences.

123
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:51,626
All right,
let's go see the Era Meteor Shower.

124
00:11:59,801 --> 00:12:02,471
You look so distinguished now, Heiter.

125
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:04,264
I'm a bishop in the Holy City now.

126
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,851
You haven't changed at all.

127
00:12:07,934 --> 00:12:09,686
Stop patting my head.

128
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,357
Eisen, you haven't changed much.

129
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,861
-Yeah? You think so?
-You're a dwarf after all.

130
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,239
So, where is this place with a great view?

131
00:12:22,532 --> 00:12:24,409
We're going there now?

132
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:28,372
It's still a little early
for the Era Meteor Shower.

133
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:32,376
Yeah, so we'll walk
for about a week from here.

134
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,879
-It's that far?
-Jeez…

135
00:12:36,713 --> 00:12:38,882
What a way to abuse the elderly.

136
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,764
<i>This brings back memories.</i>
<i>When we're like this,</i>

137
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:47,891
<i>I feel as if I've gone back in time.</i>

138
00:12:52,437 --> 00:12:54,731
<i>We traveled to many places, didn't we?</i>

139
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,402
<i>Everything was so new</i>

140
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:00,904
<i>and appeared to be sparkling.</i>

141
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:30,767
<i>All of you were always</i>
<i>a part of my beautiful memories.</i>

142
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,772
You know,

143
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:39,651
I've always looked forward to the day
when we could all get together again.

144
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,529
Thank you, Frieren.

145
00:13:43,321 --> 00:13:45,031
Thanks to you,

146
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,660
I was able to enjoy one last adventure.

147
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:14,269
How beautiful.

148
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:45,258
I'm sure Himmel was happy.

149
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,511
You think so?

150
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:57,771
That girl was Sir Himmel's comrade?

151
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,273
She doesn't even look sad.

152
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,359
How heartless!

153
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:07,155
My, my! We don't look sad either!

154
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,908
-Bishop, take it more seriously!
-How heartless!

155
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,161
They're so harsh.

156
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,311
I mean,

157
00:15:38,895 --> 00:15:41,523
I don't know anything about him.

158
00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:57,205
We traveled together
for merely ten years, that's all.

159
00:16:04,504 --> 00:16:06,673
Humans have a short lifespan.

160
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,884
I knew that.

161
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:11,386
So why didn't I try

162
00:16:12,387 --> 00:16:15,056
to get to know him better?

163
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,276
Stop patting my head.

164
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,829
All right,
I'd better head back to the Holy City.

165
00:16:41,249 --> 00:16:43,585
Let me get a good look at you two.

166
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,463
I'm sure this will be the last time.

167
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,214
Are you ill?

168
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,967
My drinking habits have caught up with me.

169
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,011
It must be punishment.

170
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,264
If you ever visit the Holy City,

171
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,850
leave some alcohol by my grave.

172
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:03,563
Heiter, you're not afraid to die?

173
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,402
We're the party of heroes
that saved this world.

174
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:13,365
After I die, I'm promised
a lavish life in heaven.

175
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,827
That's the reason why I fought
alongside you all in the first place.

176
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,579
Corrupt Priest.

177
00:17:21,831 --> 00:17:23,500
Well then, I'll be off.

178
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,469
All right, I'll get going too.

179
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,639
A trip to pursue magic?

180
00:17:37,722 --> 00:17:39,391
Yeah, that too.

181
00:17:40,433 --> 00:17:43,436
But I also want to
get to know humans better.

182
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,815
I see.

183
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:51,945
I have something to ask you.
Since I'm a mage,

184
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:54,864
I could use a strong vanguard.

185
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,574
Give me a break.

186
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,828
I'm too old to be wielding an axe.

187
00:18:02,914 --> 00:18:05,709
Don't look at me like that, Frieren.

188
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:10,964
Once you start aging, it's a surprisingly
long journey from there.

189
00:18:12,882 --> 00:18:13,717
I see.

190
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,763
-See you, Eisen.
-See you.

191
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:56,801
{\an8}THE JOURNEY'S END

192
00:19:00,513 --> 00:19:04,142
I just saw this tree.
I always get lost in this forest.

193
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,394
Where am I?

194
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,104
20 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF THE HERO HIMMEL

195
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,148
THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE HOLY CITY, STRAHL
IN THE CENTRAL LANDS

196
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,901
Are you looking for something?

197
00:19:18,114 --> 00:19:19,908
Is something wrong?

198
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:24,913
No, I was looking for the house
of someone named Heiter.

199
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:27,332
Then you must be a visitor.

200
00:19:30,251 --> 00:19:32,879
You are still alive, Corrupt Priest?

201
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:38,009
Turns out, it's not so easy
to die in a dignified way.

202
00:19:38,676 --> 00:19:40,845
I bought alcohol to leave at your grave.

203
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,555
You want to drink?

204
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,101
-I've stopped drinking already.
-I see.

205
00:19:46,184 --> 00:19:51,272
I think it's too late to start behaving
for the goddess to forgive you.

206
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:00,657
Thank you.

207
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:08,331
-Who is that?
-Her name is Fern.

208
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:11,835
She was a war orphan
from the Southern lands.

209
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:15,004
How surprising.

210
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,341
You're not the type
to voluntarily help people.

211
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:19,425
That's Himmel's job.

212
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,890
Frieren, why did you visit me?

213
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,934
I'm on my way to the Holy City.

214
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:32,272
I make it a point to keep in touch
with whoever I meet on the road.

215
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,276
Plus, I owe a lot to you, Heiter.

216
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,278
I wanted to return the favor
before you died.

217
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:43,950
Then let me ask you for a favor.

218
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:47,120
Will you take an apprentice?

219
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:53,001
Fern has the potential to become a mage.

220
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:56,004
Will you take her along with you
on your travels?

221
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,010
Sorry, Heiter. I can't do that.

222
00:21:02,093 --> 00:21:03,845
She'll just be a burden.

223
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:09,142
You know the mortality rate
of mage apprentices on the battlefield.

224
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,605
I'm not going to let a friend's child
left in my care die like that.

225
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:18,067
I see.

226
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:20,862
Then I have another favor.

227
00:21:26,242 --> 00:21:29,787
This was excavated from
the grave of Ewig the Sage.

228
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:34,417
They say this grimoire contains
long-lost spells regarding

229
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,295
the resurrection of the dead
and immortality.

230
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,924
I doubt such magic really exists.

231
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:44,928
That's why I want you to decipher it.

232
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:46,429
Can you do that?

233
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,224
It's encoded in pictures, right?

234
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:52,018
People of this era
sure loved this kind of stuff.

235
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:54,771
It'll only take five to six years.

236
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:57,023
I see.

237
00:21:57,732 --> 00:22:00,735
What's the point
in deciphering this anyway?

238
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:03,404
I thought you weren't afraid to die?

239
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,406
I have two reasons.

240
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:10,411
One, I was just trying to act cool
in front of you two.

241
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,958
Two, compared to then,
I am more afraid of dying now.

242
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,545
Well, even if I can't become immortal,
I just wanted…

243
00:22:20,129 --> 00:22:24,133
I just wanted
a little more time, that's all.

244
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:32,183
Besides, the scriptures tell us
to live in good health.

245
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:35,436
Longevity is
the prime example of that, Frieren.

246
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,438
Corrupt Priest.

247
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:40,316
Also,

248
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,236
if you have time
in between your efforts to decipher that,

249
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:46,197
will you be able to teach Fern magic?

250
00:22:46,781 --> 00:22:50,785
I'm a priest,
so I'm not very good with that.

251
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:53,871
Sure, I can do that.

252
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,797
There you are.

253
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:08,469
I had trouble finding you.
Do you always train in the forest?

254
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:13,224
Mistress Frieren,
even you had trouble finding me?

255
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:18,021
Master Heiter always says
that my presence is undetectable.

256
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:22,150
It is a very good thing.

257
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:24,861
Yeah.

258
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,865
<i>Just as I thought…</i>

259
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:31,868
<i>I can barely detect her mana.</i>

260
00:23:32,493 --> 00:23:35,121
<i>That requires remarkable mana control.</i>

261
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:38,958
<i>How hard did she study to be able</i>
<i>to do that at her age?</i>

262
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:40,877
Master Heiter

263
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:45,631
said that he'll consider me
fully qualified if I can pierce that rock.

264
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:49,635
Heiter knows what he's talking about.
That is--

265
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:59,562
As you can see, my mana disperses
and doesn't reach it.

266
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,564
I see.

267
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,568
What kind of training do I need to do?

268
00:24:05,651 --> 00:24:08,321
Hey, can I ask you something first?

269
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,865
Do you like magic?

270
00:24:11,824 --> 00:24:13,326
To a moderate degree.

271
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:17,789
That's just like me.

272
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:52,967
<i>-Trying to act cool again, Heiter?</i>
<i>-How is your training with Fern?</i>

273
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,178
<i>-Magic is so amazing.</i>
<i>-It's worth looking for.</i>

274
00:25:55,261 --> 00:25:57,722
<i>-It'd be a waste to die.</i>
<i>-One day I want to show you.</i>

275
00:25:57,805 --> 00:25:59,765
<i>"It didn't have to be magic…"</i>

276
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:00,808
