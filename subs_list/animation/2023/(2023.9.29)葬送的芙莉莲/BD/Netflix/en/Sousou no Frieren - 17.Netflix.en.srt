1
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:04,211
But the goal of my journey is this.

2
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:08,966
To meet my friend who embarked on
a journey ten years ago.

3
00:00:16,974 --> 00:00:19,060
Did you find out where Gorilla went?

4
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:21,979
Tür.

5
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:25,858
<i>It's a trade city in the northern lands.</i>

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,985
<i>It's farther east from here.</i>

7
00:00:28,694 --> 00:00:31,238
In the opposite direction from Äußerst.

8
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,532
Yeah.

9
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,668
Frieren,

10
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:47,546
I embarked on this journey
in order to find Gorilla.

11
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,340
I know.

12
00:00:51,008 --> 00:00:53,636
Either way, the sun is about to set,

13
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,180
so can't we hold off on deciding
until tomorrow?

14
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,601
I was able to rent a cabin.

15
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:02,937
They said we're free to use it.

16
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:04,814
Thank you.

17
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:12,279
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

18
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,719
I brought some firewood.

19
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:02,056
I bought groceries so we can make dinner.

20
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:06,769
My hands are so cold.

21
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:09,480
It's starting to get pretty cold nowadays.

22
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,691
You weren't joking. Wow…

23
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,693
This is record-breaking.

24
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,240
Let me see…

25
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:23,494
-You're right. It's so cold.
-Isn't it?

26
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,125
Stop that!

27
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,628
-Isn't it record-breaking?
-Yeah.

28
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:35,422
-So cold…
-Jeez…

29
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,639
It's snowing.

30
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:47,143
Will we have to wait out the winter again?

31
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:51,522
This time, it's not like
we have to pass a steep mountain range.

32
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,276
It'll be fine unless it turns into
a blizzard or something.

33
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,366
It did.

34
00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:03,951
-It sure did.
-It did.

35
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:08,497
Cold spells in this region
last for at least a month.

36
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,791
You shouldn't travel too far.

37
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,587
You can use that cabin for the time being.

38
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:21,177
What do you want to do, Sein?
Do you want to depart?

39
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,137
Do you even need to ask?

40
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:25,764
I guess we're stuck
until the cold spell passes.

41
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,558
Yup.

42
00:04:28,475 --> 00:04:33,022
Well, there's a bar and a general store,
and the cabin is spacious.

43
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:36,567
It's much better compared to
the mountain cabin from last time.

44
00:04:37,818 --> 00:04:39,820
And most importantly, this village has

45
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,449
a magic store run by
a suspicious old person.

46
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,202
<i>Based on my experience,</i>

47
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:49,371
<i>you can find legendary spells</i>
<i>in places like that.</i>

48
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:53,417
Being able to explore that store
is a big plus.

49
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,420
Legendary spells?

50
00:04:56,503 --> 00:04:58,547
What kinds have you found in the past?

51
00:05:00,424 --> 00:05:02,718
Spells to get rid of mold

52
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:05,387
and spells to remove tough oil stains.

53
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:07,681
Wow.

54
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:12,853
That's true.
Those useful spells were life-changing.

55
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,147
They sound like
tips you learn from your grandma.

56
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:18,567
Either way, all we can do now is wait.

57
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:22,404
You'll die if you take winter
in the northern lands lightly.

58
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:28,077
After all, Master Stark almost died
in the Schwer Mountains.

59
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:31,247
I was raised in the northern lands.

60
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,957
I know that much.

61
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,546
Well, I guess we'll be together
for a little while longer.

62
00:06:09,201 --> 00:06:11,620
The cold spell should end soon.

63
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:15,165
You adventurers can finally depart.

64
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,668
Yeah, that's right.

65
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:21,755
Hey, we barely spent time together.

66
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,134
-Sein.
-Huh?

67
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:28,804
-Do you have a moment?
-What's wrong, Frieren?

68
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,348
It's rare to see you at the bar.

69
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:35,602
Stark and Fern are acting strange.

70
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:39,273
I think they're fighting.
Be their mediator.

71
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,652
I don't mind doing that,
but why are you asking me?

72
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,488
Mediating is a priest's job.

73
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:48,615
It is?

74
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,291
This looks bad.

75
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,210
Hey, what happened?

76
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:02,546
It's Master Stark's fault.

77
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:06,216
Yes, it is all my fault.

78
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:09,136
This is going nowhere.

79
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,475
Come to the room next door, one at a time.

80
00:07:24,943 --> 00:07:27,613
So, what happened?

81
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,824
When we first moved into this cabin,

82
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:34,453
Fern touched my cheek
with her cold hands, remember?

83
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:36,914
Yeah.

84
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,167
Today, I did the same thing to her…

85
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,922
<i>-And Fern just blew up.</i>
<i>-How childish.</i>

86
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,720
Did you really think a girl would like
to have your hands all over her face?

87
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:57,643
-Do you want things to stay like this?
-I want to make peace.

88
00:07:58,143 --> 00:08:02,981
Stark, unlike me,
you are a genuinely good guy.

89
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,067
So just say your honest feelings.

90
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:09,696
If you want to make peace,
let that person know.

91
00:08:10,322 --> 00:08:13,117
Frieren's not going to
mediate between you two.

92
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:19,164
Yeah, I know. I'll apologize to Fern.

93
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,293
Stark regrets what he did.

94
00:08:23,877 --> 00:08:27,840
He's just a kid. He didn't mean any harm.

95
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:29,091
I know.

96
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,844
I was just stubborn.

97
00:08:32,594 --> 00:08:34,054
I want to apologize.

98
00:08:34,763 --> 00:08:37,057
I'm the one who started it, anyway.

99
00:08:37,766 --> 00:08:40,060
The fact that he touched me
wasn't the issue.

100
00:08:40,936 --> 00:08:42,020
It's just that…

101
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:46,108
<i>he held my shoulder down</i>
<i>with such strong force.</i>

102
00:08:48,193 --> 00:08:51,572
It made me feel scared, just a little.

103
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,284
Do you hate Stark?

104
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:59,621
Why would you ask such a thing?
Does it come across that way?

105
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:04,460
Then let him know that you felt scared
and make peace with him.

106
00:09:06,628 --> 00:09:09,965
-Be more gentle with me.
-I'm sorry.

107
00:09:14,803 --> 00:09:16,763
Just get together already!

108
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:22,895
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I can tell you're doing your best.

109
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,440
Thank you. That was really helpful.

110
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,819
Frieren, you are the only one.

111
00:09:31,361 --> 00:09:35,365
-You commend me as if I'm a kid.
-You are a kid.

112
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,119
It doesn't feel too bad, I guess.

113
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,375
Hey, I've been wanting to ask…

114
00:09:46,668 --> 00:09:49,421
I've been thinking ever since
you recruited me,

115
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,341
but why do you spend so much
time and energy on me?

116
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,554
Because I have an aversion to my own kind.

117
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,682
Seeing you refuse to go on an adventure

118
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:04,645
reminded me of myself before
I departed to defeat the Demon King.

119
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:05,979
<i>And it annoyed me.</i>

120
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:10,400
That doesn't explain
why you would care about me.

121
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,818
That's exactly why.

122
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,697
I think I just wanted to
give you an opportunity.

123
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,824
What does that mean?

124
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:23,330
It's what Himmel the Hero would've done,
that's all.

125
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,834
Take my hand, Frieren.

126
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:32,172
I will give you the opportunity
to embark on a journey.

127
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:41,056
Himmel and everyone
gave me the courage to step out

128
00:10:41,139 --> 00:10:44,226
and taught me the joy
that comes from being with friends.

129
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:49,189
How was it, Sein? Wasn't it fun?

130
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:55,404
It was a lot of fun.

131
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:11,461
We'll become heroes that
nobody can forget, like Himmel the Hero.

132
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:15,841
I'm talking about
what you can do "now," Sein.

133
00:11:16,591 --> 00:11:21,346
So I decided to believe in her words.

134
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,434
Gorilla always talked about you.

135
00:11:26,393 --> 00:11:29,438
He said that the two of you
will become heroes whose names

136
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,690
<i>will be engraved in history forever.</i>

137
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,842
I'll follow after Gorilla, after all.

138
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,678
I don't want to have any more regrets.

139
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:04,056
I understand.

140
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,808
Well, take care.

141
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:11,021
See you.

142
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,191
See you.

143
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,493
You parted ways so easily.

144
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,080
Unlike you two, Sein is an adult.

145
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,374
He'll be fine.

146
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:51,812
It's so quiet when you're alone…

147
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:57,234
29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

148
00:12:57,317 --> 00:13:00,445
OFFEN MOUNTAIN RANGE
IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

149
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,381
Oh? That's rare… She's still sleeping?

150
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:23,802
She's probably tired,
since we've been walking nonstop.

151
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:40,861
Good enough.

152
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,948
Hey, breakfast is ready.

153
00:13:45,031 --> 00:13:46,616
It's time to wake up.

154
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,954
Fern?

155
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,294
Hey, wake up, Frieren.

156
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,672
Give me half a day…

157
00:14:00,755 --> 00:14:03,091
You can't sleep that much.

158
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,844
More importantly, Fern looks unwell.

159
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:12,017
Hey.

160
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,233
Stop that.

161
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,529
You have a fever.

162
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:26,907
Stay warm and sleep.

163
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,077
Let's see…

164
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:40,003
-What? That's weird…
-I brought water.

165
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:42,923
-Found it.
-What's that?

166
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:47,552
A notebook about
medicinal herbs that Sein left for us.

167
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,596
Sein did that?

168
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,015
If I diagnose the illness with magic,

169
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:54,059
I can find the right herbs to use.

170
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,813
But you need the Magic of the Goddess
to diagnose illnesses.

171
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,025
I thought only people with
Scriptures could use that.

172
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,362
I have Scriptures too.

173
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,494
It's being used as a placemat!

174
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:16,957
I may not be gifted like a priest,

175
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,876
but I can at least do a simple diagnosis.

176
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,964
-I don't know about complicated illnesses.
-Can we trust you?

177
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,593
Yeah, it's just a common cold.

178
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,597
Medicinal herbs that grow
in this area are…

179
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:35,934
That reminds me…

180
00:15:36,017 --> 00:15:40,230
I collected medicinal herbs around here
with Himmel and everyone.

181
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,025
For now, let's move to where
we can stay warm.

182
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:46,111
You're right.

183
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:58,498
Oh my.

184
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:08,508
What a lifesaver.

185
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:12,387
Who would've thought that someone
lived in these mountains.

186
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,973
The last time I came, there was a village.

187
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,435
That was decades ago.

188
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:23,231
It was a prestigious village
that even the hero visited once.

189
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,902
Well anyway, get some rest here.

190
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:28,320
Thank you.

191
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:32,866
By the way, wasn't there
an icicle cherry blossom tree around here?

192
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:35,493
Yes, north of here.

193
00:16:36,244 --> 00:16:38,747
It's a bit complicated to get to.

194
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:40,498
It's fine.

195
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,168
I've been here before.

196
00:16:45,253 --> 00:16:48,048
All right then, I'll be working.

197
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,801
Wait here, Fern.

198
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:54,512
We'll go get ingredients
for your medicine.

199
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,891
You've been holding her hand
ever since we got here.

200
00:16:58,558 --> 00:17:00,018
She looks like she's in pain.

201
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:05,065
When Fern catches a cold,
holding her hand comforts her.

202
00:17:05,732 --> 00:17:07,901
She's been like this
ever since she was small.

203
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:12,781
What's wrong?

204
00:17:14,032 --> 00:17:15,241
Mistress Frieren,

205
00:17:16,117 --> 00:17:17,535
you're embarrassing me.

206
00:17:18,536 --> 00:17:19,537
Why?

207
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:24,042
Please don't treat me like a child.

208
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,965
I see. You're right.

209
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:37,055
She'll be a full-fledged adult
in just two years, huh?

210
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,101
Just the other day,
she was a little girl about this tall.

211
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,396
I was much taller than her too.

212
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,815
Time flew by.

213
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,319
In my mind, Fern is still just a child.

214
00:17:52,487 --> 00:17:55,573
That probably won't change from now on.

215
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,326
Frieren…

216
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:02,080
We'd better hurry up
and gather the ingredients.

217
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,669
Yeah.

218
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,362
The icicle cherry blossom tree
is around here.

219
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:36,906
That icicle cherry blossom

220
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,951
is the last ingredient, huh?

221
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,621
We actually need the mushroom
that grows on the tree's roots.

222
00:18:57,552 --> 00:18:58,678
It's beautiful.

223
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,431
I wish Fern could've seen it too.

224
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:05,268
This is probably my favorite flower
that blooms in the winter.

225
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:09,397
The flowers are poisonous, so be careful.

226
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:11,691
Hey,

227
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,652
why did you hold Fern's hand?

228
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:17,822
You normally don't treat her like a child.

229
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,367
I didn't mean to treat her like a child.

230
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,455
I only held her hand
because she looked like she was in pain.

231
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:31,086
That's the only method I know
to relieve pain.

232
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:36,591
I wonder what I was
supposed to do instead?

233
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,263
If that's the case,
just do what you feel is best.

234
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,558
At least, that's what my master did.

235
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:50,730
I believe people need emotional support.

236
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,485
And no one would complain
about getting support.

237
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,243
What is this about?

238
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,620
You were having a nightmare.

239
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:08,873
People feel vulnerable when they're sick.

240
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,001
My mother, who died when I was small,

241
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,504
used to hold my hand like this.

242
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,798
It's comforting.

243
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,509
That's because you were a child.

244
00:20:20,176 --> 00:20:24,097
It's not only children
who need emotional support.

245
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,976
It doesn't feel so bad, right?

246
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,354
I guess so.

247
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:34,065
It's not too bad.

248
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:38,361
I'm so thoughtful and handsome, aren't I?

249
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:39,779
Shut up.

250
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,367
Your medicine is ready.

251
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:51,791
Fern was probably embarrassed
because I was there.

252
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:57,130
Nobody would want others to see
themselves getting spoiled.

253
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:00,216
Thank you, Stark.

254
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,386
I'll do what I feel is best.

255
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:09,559
In return, when you catch a cold,
I will hold your hand.

256
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,728
No way, that's embarrassing.

257
00:21:13,271 --> 00:21:16,733
All right, let's get this mushroom.

258
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,110
Up we go.

259
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:22,113
I didn't expect it to be that big!
How scary!

260
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:25,617
Now, just add the other ingredients

261
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,870
and mix it very, very well.

262
00:21:28,953 --> 00:21:31,372
She looks like a witch. So scary!

263
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,877
Open your mouth, Fern.

264
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:48,514
You're so good at this. What a great help.

265
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,350
You think so?

266
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,355
Don't worry, you'll get better soon.

267
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:59,817
Mistress Frieren, I'm not a child anymore…

268
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:01,736
I know.

269
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,197
I know.

270
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,627
Take care now!

271
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:21,130
Thank you very much.

272
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,633
You seem much better.

273
00:22:25,426 --> 00:22:27,720
It's thanks to Mistress Frieren,

274
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,264
Master Stark, and Master Sein.

275
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,684
And I really owe that person

276
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:35,186
who lent us their house.

277
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,147
All right.

278
00:22:38,773 --> 00:22:39,649
Well then,

279
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:43,903
let's head to Äußerst, the city of magic.

280
00:24:20,374 --> 00:24:21,709
<i>-Can you show me that?</i>
<i>-Come at me.</i>

281
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,170
<i>-This year is full of potential.</i>
<i>-You wanna fight?</i>

282
00:24:24,253 --> 00:24:25,797
<i>-I can't do it alone.</i>
<i>-You have them.</i>

283
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,173
<i>-The eyes of a killer.</i>
<i>-No idea.</i>

284
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:29,884
<i>"First-Class Mage Exam."</i>
