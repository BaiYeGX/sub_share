1
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,521
Long time no see, Flamme.

00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:48,547
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

3
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,975
Bargland.

4
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,373
Young ones are just too hot-blooded.

5
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,002
I couldn't care less about the privilege.

6
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,964
Hey, why do you feel that way?

7
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:57,009
Do you even need to ask?

8
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:59,595
When it comes to magic,

9
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:02,890
the process of searching for it
is the most fun part.

10
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:05,559
That is all.

11
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:06,894
I see.

12
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,608
Time flies, doesn't it?

13
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:15,486
The apprentice whom I raised on a whim

14
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,738
has already brought over
her own apprentice.

15
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,740
This is Frieren.

16
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,034
An elf, huh?

17
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,287
You're strong. I like you.

18
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,377
Name whatever spell you desire.
I will bestow one upon you.

19
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:34,755
A spell I desire?

20
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,675
I know almost all the spells found in

21
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:40,636
every grimoire written in history.

22
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,514
Mages spend

23
00:03:43,597 --> 00:03:44,974
their whole lives

24
00:03:45,057 --> 00:03:47,560
in search of the spell of their dreams.

25
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:51,397
Tell me yours. I will bestow it upon you.

26
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,440
I don't want it.

27
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:59,697
The process of searching for magic
is the most fun part.

28
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:02,408
Flamme,

29
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,910
this girl is no good, after all.

30
00:04:05,494 --> 00:04:09,165
She lacks ambition… fiery ambition.

31
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,875
Master,

32
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:14,545
she will defeat the Demon King one day.

33
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,257
I believe mages like her

34
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,885
will be the pioneers of an era of peace.

35
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,137
Are you saying that I can't?

36
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:27,391
Someone who pursues fighting, like you,
cannot kill the Demon King.

37
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,394
It's not possible for people like us.

38
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,022
Think about it, Master.

39
00:04:33,772 --> 00:04:37,818
I bet you can't imagine yourself
living in an era of peace.

40
00:04:41,238 --> 00:04:44,408
Frieren is a mage
who was meant for an era of peace.

41
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,541
Very good.

42
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,628
This is how mages ought to be.

43
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,728
<i>Damn it. I can't freeze him at all.</i>

44
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,064
<i>Our difference in mana is too great.</i>

45
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,233
Nephtear.

46
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,909
How weak.

47
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,997
-Kanne, defend us!
-I know!

48
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,920
You two ran around, making quite the show,

49
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,340
so I know your abilities to some extent.

50
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:48,013
Your ice magic lacks lethality

51
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,225
and you're a mage who can't fight
unless there's water.

52
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,771
What did I get myself into?

53
00:05:56,563 --> 00:05:58,774
This really is nothing but babysitting.

54
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:07,032
Well, that's harsh.

55
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,827
Look at you and your flashy magic.

56
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:12,746
Are you sure your mana is going to last?

57
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,291
You two are from the Magic Academy, right?

58
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:18,752
Are those old people still teaching

59
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:22,631
attrition warfare that relies
mainly on defensive magic?

60
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,508
What do you mean?

61
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,761
Let me give you a lesson
on the history of magic.

62
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:32,766
Defensive magic, which was
developed to counter Zoltraak,

63
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,520
has a strong resistance
against magic itself,

64
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,606
but its capability to defend
physical attacks

65
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,775
has hardly made any improvements.

66
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:45,529
Of course, there is a reason behind this.

67
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:49,658
<i>That's because it was</i>
<i>already enough to block</i>

68
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,036
<i>physical attacks of monsters and warriors.</i>

69
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:56,290
Defensive magic
must not be overengineered.

70
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,668
Trying to make it perfect will
overcomplicate the procedure

71
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:03,047
and have a critical effect
on the activation speed.

72
00:07:03,964 --> 00:07:07,301
The history of magic
is all about offense and defense.

73
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:09,678
So now, most modern offensive magic

74
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,056
are spells that manipulate
physical matter.

75
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,060
Can you tell what I'm trying to say?

76
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:20,814
No Kanne, dodge!

77
00:07:27,571 --> 00:07:29,323
My magic allows me to

78
00:07:29,406 --> 00:07:32,409
attack using the overwhelming mass
of physical matter.

79
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:35,454
Just go to sleep.

80
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:40,793
Oh, come on.

81
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:42,795
I don't enjoy bullying people.

82
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,799
Or do you actually want me to kill you?

83
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:50,677
Isn't it careless of you
to get that close?

84
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:54,431
You know, 60% of the human body is water.

85
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,433
So what?

86
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,062
Magic is all about visualizing.

87
00:08:00,562 --> 00:08:04,650
Are you able to visualize how water
is distributed in the body?

88
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,611
Can you visualize extracting
and manipulating it?

89
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,948
How would you even do that
against a mage who is

90
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:12,783
protected by a ton of mana?

91
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:17,204
If you can't visualize it,
you can't realize it with magic.

92
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:20,874
And plus, even if there was water here,

93
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,210
a little girl like her is no threat to me.

94
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:28,090
You won't even fall for our bluff?
What a mean adult.

95
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,593
But there's one thing I found out.

96
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,596
You're lying, aren't you, you bastard?

97
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:38,434
If you love fighting
enough to lecture us on it,

98
00:08:38,517 --> 00:08:41,728
you would've defeated us
somewhere where there was water.

99
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:44,440
What are you afraid of?

100
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:50,237
Don't do anything.

101
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,491
My job is to put you two to sleep.

102
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,369
Unless Denken loses, that is.

103
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,386
<i>At this rate, it's going to end</i>
<i>with me running out of mana.</i>

104
00:09:16,346 --> 00:09:18,724
This is a bit tough
for an old man like me.

105
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,977
Sorry, but I'll have to end this quickly,

106
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,562
Frieren.

107
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,566
Waldgose.

108
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,736
Daosdorg.

109
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,996
That old fart…
What kind of battle is this?

110
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,167
That old man is going all out, isn't he?

111
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,294
Will the barrier be okay?

112
00:09:47,377 --> 00:09:48,795
Don't be silly.

113
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,758
This barrier was put up
by the Great Mage Serie.

114
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:56,345
It's not something you can
break by using force.

115
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,097
I see. I'll take your word for it.

116
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:01,892
By the way, someone has been

117
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:05,020
deciphering the barrier
from around last night.

118
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,105
What for?

119
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,148
I don't know.

120
00:10:09,024 --> 00:10:11,652
Either way, it's useless.

121
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,906
As if there is a mage
who can surpass Serie in this world.

122
00:10:24,831 --> 00:10:26,583
Catastravia.

123
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:37,844
<i>No way! A counterattack?</i>

124
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,305
<i>I barraged her with arrows of light.</i>

125
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,765
<i>There was no time to--</i>

126
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:02,911
<i>I'm out of mana… So this is the end, huh?</i>

127
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,038
<i>Unbelievable…</i>

128
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:09,668
<i>Until the very end,</i>
<i>she used nothing but basic combat magic.</i>

129
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:11,920
<i>This was no different</i>

130
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:16,174
<i>than a practice match</i>
<i>against an apprentice mage.</i>

131
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,343
I'm shocked.

132
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,514
I've come this far, and yet there is
still someone better than me.

133
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:24,641
Tell me where Laufen is.

134
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:28,979
I'm sure you know.
I'll be taking back our Stille.

135
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,859
If you were in my shoes,
would you say the location?

136
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,278
That's true…

137
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:49,708
Laufen, I know you're hiding nearby.

138
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:52,210
Bring the Stille to me.

139
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,715
If you don't come, I will kill Denken.

140
00:11:56,798 --> 00:12:00,719
Don't do it, Laufen.
She has no intent to kill.

141
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:02,554
I'm sure you can tell.

142
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:05,891
<i>The old man was defeated? Compared to me…</i>

143
00:12:05,974 --> 00:12:09,728
<i>No, even compared to Richter,</i>
<i>she is a far superior mage.</i>

144
00:12:10,562 --> 00:12:14,274
<i>But she has her guard down.</i>
<i>She isn't touching the old man.</i>

145
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,693
Don't use Jilwer.

146
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:19,029
Stay hidden.

147
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:22,866
She can detect
even the slightest amount of mana.

148
00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:26,286
<i>At this distance, I can retrieve</i>
<i>the old man and escape!</i>

149
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,330
Don't do it. It's a trap.

150
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:30,040
I guess I have no choice.

151
00:12:30,123 --> 00:12:33,126
I'd rather not do
things like this, though.

152
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:36,296
I found you.

153
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,467
You fool.

154
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,389
You're so immature.

155
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:48,809
It was obvious
that she had no intent to kill.

156
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:50,560
But she was

157
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,939
ready to hurt you until
you were barely alive.

158
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:57,442
But we still would have won.

159
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:03,198
Old man, why would you go that far
to become a first-class mage?

160
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:04,991
You already have everything,

161
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,327
from wealth to power, don't you?

162
00:13:12,874 --> 00:13:16,837
My hometown is deep inside
of the Northern Plateau.

163
00:13:17,462 --> 00:13:19,589
<i>Because the demons have made a ruckus,</i>

164
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,717
<i>only first-class mages can get in now.</i>

165
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,721
I hadn't visited the cemetery in a while,
so I wanted to go.

166
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:28,932
That is all.

167
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,478
Shouldn't you go help those kids?

168
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:37,607
Although, it may be too late.

169
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,444
Richter will kill them

170
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:42,487
before fighting you.

171
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,616
He's the kind of man who can
make rational decisions like that.

172
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,662
There's no need to worry about that.
Those two will win.

173
00:13:52,664 --> 00:13:55,459
I've just finished
deciphering the barrier.

174
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,422
Who would've thought
that Denken would lose.

175
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,466
Well then…

176
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:06,136
Babysitting time is over now.

177
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,164
He's seriously trying to kill us.

178
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:36,917
We won't even last a minute.

179
00:14:38,126 --> 00:14:39,920
The barrier? Deciphering?

180
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,088
What do you mean?

181
00:14:45,091 --> 00:14:48,678
Frieren, don't tell me…

182
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,314
Genau…

183
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,358
Don't worry.

184
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:05,695
It's impossible
even if the world turned upside down.

185
00:15:13,411 --> 00:15:14,663
It's going to break.

186
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:25,841
Sense, who is that elf mage?

187
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:30,345
<i>According to the examinee roster,</i>
<i>her name is Frieren.</i>

188
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,932
That's the same name as the mage
from the party of heroes.

189
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:37,978
And apparently, she had the Holy Emblem.

190
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:41,606
The last great mage, huh?

191
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,109
You've really done it, Frieren.

192
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:48,613
What a way to greet someone
for the first time in a thousand years.

193
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,617
This is why I don't get tired
of being a mage.

194
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:57,330
In the world of magic,
the world can turn upside down.

195
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,751
I can't believe you actually
broke the barrier.

196
00:16:02,377 --> 00:16:03,920
Why did you do that?

197
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,506
Because I felt bad for Kanne.

198
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:09,467
Magic shouldn't have limitations.

199
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,762
The mage who can manipulate water, huh?

200
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,473
Magic is all about visualizing.

201
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:20,478
Can you imagine winning against a mage
who can manipulate water, in the rain?

202
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,481
I can't, at least.

203
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,860
<i>I'm sure Richter is the same.</i>

204
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,612
The barrier…

205
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,115
-What just happened?
-The rain…

206
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:35,660
Whatever,
I can assess the situation later.

207
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,871
I have to finish them off quickly--

208
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,248
You finally let your guard down.

209
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,043
Your mana is unstable
because you're rushing.

210
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:45,253
This level of stalling is nothing!

211
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,133
Now I understand

212
00:16:50,216 --> 00:16:53,637
why you were scared of
her water-manipulating magic.

213
00:16:54,846 --> 00:16:56,598
Just like you said,

214
00:16:56,681 --> 00:17:00,393
this is an attack using
the overwhelming mass of physical matter.

215
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,145
Lawine,

216
00:17:02,228 --> 00:17:03,897
don't let him escape.

217
00:17:04,981 --> 00:17:06,066
Reamstroha.

218
00:17:09,402 --> 00:17:11,780
There is nowhere to escape anyway.

219
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:17,118
This is why I hate water.

220
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:32,968
You won, huh?

221
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:35,261
Let's get out of here quickly.

222
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:39,432
We have two hours until sundown,
but can you conceal your mana until then?

223
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,435
We don't even have any
mana left to conceal.

224
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,063
I see. Good job.

225
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:47,273
Don't pat me.

226
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:51,778
Sorry.

227
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,365
It couldn't be helped.

228
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:03,206
Both Denken and I are all out of mana.

229
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:09,129
There's only two hours left.
We're done for.

230
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:15,093
Laufen, can you break this restraint?

231
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:18,763
Are you kidding? The amount of
mana in this restraint is crazy.

232
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,642
Then how about the tree? Cut it down.

233
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,528
Denken, it's not possible anymore.

234
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:38,324
I don't have enough mana
to use Jilwer anymore either.

235
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,411
Richter, Laufen,

236
00:18:41,494 --> 00:18:45,415
what do you think an Imperial Mage
would do in this situation?

237
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,419
They'd persist until the end,
no matter how unsightly it is.

238
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:55,425
Let's search for traces of battles
fought by other parties and follow them.

239
00:18:57,343 --> 00:18:58,678
You know, Fern,

240
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:01,973
you are so boring.

241
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,936
You seriously only use basic magic.

242
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,939
Please bring that up to Mistress Frieren.

243
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,903
Oh right,
that elf was your master, wasn't she?

244
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,533
It's her fault that we've become drenched,

245
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,744
so you'd better scold her.

246
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,829
I already plan to.

247
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:29,667
Also, I am free to use any spell
as long as it's not combat related.

248
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:34,214
Now that you mention it,
you did use a spell to capture the bird.

249
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,674
What other spells can you use?

250
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:41,805
Let's see…
A spell that lets you see through clothes.

251
00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:44,933
I'm not going to use it.

252
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:49,521
Hey, I'm sorry to interrupt
your fun little conversation,

253
00:19:49,604 --> 00:19:52,315
but I wouldn't reveal all my tricks
if I were you.

254
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,945
From the second stage of the exam,
we will become enemies.

255
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,948
That's true.

256
00:20:00,031 --> 00:20:01,449
Sorry.

257
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:06,454
But you still could've warmed up to us
a little more, Four-eyes.

258
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,838
There they are. A defeated party.

259
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:18,466
I saw the dead body
of their party member nearby.

260
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,553
There is no chance
for them to pass the exam,

261
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:24,681
but they're still
holding onto that precious Stille.

262
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,854
Are you going to negotiate with them?

263
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:32,939
They wouldn't agree to it.

264
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:35,441
If I were in their shoes,

265
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,610
I would refuse even if they paid me.

266
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:38,945
Why?

267
00:20:39,654 --> 00:20:41,656
Because it's irritating.

268
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,075
It's an emotional issue.

269
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,912
Laufen, you wait here.

270
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:52,167
Steal the Stille when you see the chance.
Richter, follow me.

271
00:20:53,334 --> 00:20:54,794
What are you planning to do?

272
00:21:05,638 --> 00:21:07,557
You're going head-on?

273
00:21:08,057 --> 00:21:10,351
We don't have any mana left.

274
00:21:11,644 --> 00:21:13,313
Can't you tell?

275
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:17,817
The same applies to them as well.

276
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:27,952
Face up to it.

277
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,000
You're a man, aren't you?

278
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,836
Hey, you're kidding, right?

279
00:21:39,422 --> 00:21:43,801
It's time for a fistfight!

280
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,913
It's time.

281
00:22:13,581 --> 00:22:17,252
At this time, we will end
the first stage of the exam.

282
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:22,131
A total of 18 people in 6 parties
have passed the first stage.

283
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,634
The second stage will be in three days.

284
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,762
We will share the details later.

285
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,056
That is all.

286
00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:31,224
You're dismissed.

287
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:37,397
It's already been two days
since they went to take the exam.

288
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:42,068
Fern isn't here to get mad at me
even if I stay up late.

289
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:44,988
I'm so happy, it's almost scary.

290
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:48,950
Sounds like you have it pretty tough.

291
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:20,792
<i>It's not yours.</i>

292
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,502
<i>-No worries, Mistress Frieren.</i>
<i>-Don't talk about that.</i>

293
00:24:22,585 --> 00:24:23,795
<i>-You're more spoiled than me.</i>
<i>-It's not even your birthday.</i>

294
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:25,713
<i>-You have to eat vegetables too.</i>
<i>-and you get such treatment?</i>

295
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,007
<i>-This person is annoying.</i>
<i>-We're not a party anymore.</i>

296
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,884
<i>"Future Enemies."</i>

297
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:30,843
