29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:05,588
RAAD REGION IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

3
00:00:07,131 --> 00:00:09,717
It looks like there are
all sorts of stores.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,719
It'll be fun to shop here.

5
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:18,559
This is such a lively town.

6
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,227
There are so many bars.

7
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:24,482
That reminds me, Frieren.
Let's go shopping together later.

8
00:00:25,524 --> 00:00:28,110
I think we'll find
a lot of good shops here.

9
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,404
That's fine with me.

10
00:00:34,533 --> 00:00:37,370
What are you doing, Frieren? Let's go.

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,755
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

12
00:02:17,845 --> 00:02:19,972
<i>That's going a little too far!</i>

13
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,058
You're always so mean to me!

14
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,727
Do you hate me that much?

15
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,937
Forget it!
I'm going back to Master's place!

16
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:33,194
Why is she always like that?

17
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:35,362
Can't she listen to me for one second?

18
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,533
What's all the fuss about?
Is it a lover's quarrel?

19
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:44,246
Today is Fern's birthday.

20
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,999
But Stark didn't get a present for her.

21
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:49,835
And so Fern is furious.

22
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,673
Honestly,
I think you went overboard today.

23
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,219
You didn't even try to listen to Stark.

24
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:03,307
I didn't get you anything either.

25
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:07,478
Men don't pay attention
to small details such as

26
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:09,480
birthdays and anniversaries.

27
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,233
Ouch! All right!

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,652
I'll buy you something, so stop kicking.

29
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:17,238
My knees are going
to give out at this rate.

30
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:25,412
Jeez, I feel bad for Stark.

31
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:29,083
At my age, even if I'm treated coldly,
it's easier to brush it aside.

32
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,543
But boys his age

33
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:33,629
are easily affected
by how girls treat them.

34
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:42,388
I think it's best to go after him.

35
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:48,894
I think you should go.

36
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:24,722
Her hair accessory
was a butterfly too, wasn't it?

37
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:28,350
What a cute pouch.

38
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,686
-You hate it, don't you?
-No.

39
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:33,147
It's just off-putting
that you seem so experienced.

40
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:35,399
Is that right…

41
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:37,568
Did you find Stark?

42
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,571
He was at the plaza…

43
00:04:40,654 --> 00:04:43,073
You couldn't approach him, huh?

44
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,454
I know that you don't hate him.

45
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,082
You just don't know
how to deal with boys your age.

46
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:54,335
Oh, the woes of youth.

47
00:04:54,418 --> 00:04:57,338
Anyway, you can pick out
whichever one you want.

48
00:04:57,421 --> 00:04:59,590
We can look at other shops too.

49
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,221
No, it's all right.

50
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:08,974
Then I'll choose one myself.

51
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:14,313
In any case, you didn't have to get so mad
just because he forgot a present.

52
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:17,650
He's obviously not the type
to remember such details.

53
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,819
I'll bet you he doesn't even
remember his own birthday.

54
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,321
Don't hold it against him.

55
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,575
I gave Master Stark a present
on his birthday.

56
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,828
Oh, really? Did you pick one out
together that time?

57
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,580
How did you know?

58
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:37,002
Usually, people don't refuse when you say,
"Pick out whichever one you want."

59
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:40,965
In your mind,
it's probably a special memory.

60
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:42,341
Hence, you said "no" to me.

61
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:44,843
I'm not sure.

62
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:48,347
I just felt like doing it, that's all.

63
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,224
Is that right?

64
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:55,229
Well then, hurry up and apologize
and pick out a present with him.

65
00:05:58,565 --> 00:06:00,109
He's still a kid.

66
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,111
He's not very intuitive.

67
00:06:03,737 --> 00:06:05,239
You want to make up, right?

68
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,493
You've got to use words
to convey your feelings.

69
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,498
You're right.

70
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:17,459
-I'll go back to the inn.
-Um…

71
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:20,295
I'm sorry for kicking you.

72
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,023
Master Stark.

73
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,570
Fern…

74
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:51,160
-Um--
-I'm sorry!

75
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,042
The truth is,
I wanted to pick something out together.

76
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,670
Because I don't know what you like.

77
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:03,797
But…

78
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:07,760
I was worried
that you'd get upset if I said that.

79
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:09,511
So I couldn't bring it up.

80
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:13,182
I wouldn't get upset.

81
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,102
I'm sorry, Master Stark.

82
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,063
I said things I shouldn't have.

83
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:24,068
It's fine. I'm used to it.

84
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:26,695
I'm really sorry.

85
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,199
Let's go.

86
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:33,786
Okay.

87
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,718
You're spying on them?

88
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,970
How classy of you, Frieren.

89
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,972
Right back at you.

90
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,434
It seems they made up just fine.

91
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:02,481
As you become an adult,

92
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:04,608
you learn how to deal with others

93
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:06,985
and begin to avoid conflicts in general.

94
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,615
Fighting like that
is a privilege of the young.

95
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,868
I bet they've been a handful, Frieren.

96
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,912
It's not easy taking care of kids.

97
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:23,252
-How do you "deal with others"?
-All three of you are kids, I guess.

98
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,383
Fern came up to me for advice.

99
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:31,009
Rather than you.

100
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:35,514
I wonder who she's comparing me to
and who she sees vicariously through me.

101
00:08:36,348 --> 00:08:39,518
Fern was raised by Heiter, after all.

102
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:44,064
I can't stand to be compared
with such an incredible priest.

103
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,233
He's not incredible at all.

104
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:49,486
<i>He was a drunkard who was always</i>
<i>suffering from a hangover.</i>

105
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,113
<i>Is he an undead?</i>

106
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,323
<i>He was so picky too.</i>

107
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,241
Stop that.

108
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:57,995
-<i>And he lied all the time.</i>
-I didn't drink.

109
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:01,123
He was nothing but a corrupt priest.

110
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,877
Although,
you are even more corrupt than him, Sein.

111
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,878
Well, excuse me.

112
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:09,548
That's so surprising, though.

113
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,717
From what I recall,

114
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,636
Master Heiter was
a kind and dependable grandpa.

115
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,348
Unlike me, he was an ideal adult.

116
00:09:21,643 --> 00:09:25,022
You've changed, Heiter.
You seem mature now.

117
00:09:26,356 --> 00:09:29,818
What are you saying?
I'm an old grandpa already.

118
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,280
You naturally
turn this way as you get old.

119
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,368
Or so I'd like to say.

120
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,538
But in truth,
my heart has not changed much

121
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,415
since I was a little kid.

122
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,918
This is just the accumulation

123
00:09:46,585 --> 00:09:50,714
of my efforts to pretend to be mature
in order to become my ideal adult.

124
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:53,550
I'm sure I will

125
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,053
have to pretend
to be an adult until I die.

126
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,431
Children need an adult in their lives

127
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,808
who can give them emotional support.

128
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:04,811
<i>Fern is especially a hard worker.</i>

129
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:08,565
<i>I have to give her lots</i>
<i>of commendation and guidance.</i>

130
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,320
Well then, who will commend you,
for pretending to be an adult

131
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:14,821
until you die?

132
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,576
That is what the Goddess is there for.

133
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,996
I'll have to wait until I go to heaven.

134
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:26,208
Then I'll commend you here.

135
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:29,002
Really?

136
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:35,050
But you probably don't understand
how I feel as a human.

137
00:10:35,133 --> 00:10:36,843
How do you plan to commend me?

138
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:51,984
{\an8}Surprisingly, this isn't too bad.

139
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:55,862
Frieren, when I go to heaven,

140
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,323
I'll put in a good word for you.

141
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:00,534
I still think

142
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:03,245
you deserve to be commended
by the Goddess.

143
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:06,790
Is that so? I'll look forward to it then.

144
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:14,298
What's this about, Frieren?

145
00:11:14,923 --> 00:11:17,551
I think you're adulting just fine, Sein.

146
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,810
It would've been so nice
to be told that by an older lady.

147
00:11:27,644 --> 00:11:28,812
Then good for you.

148
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:32,566
You can't get much older than me.

149
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,988
29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

150
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:40,324
BANDE WOODS IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

151
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,743
I appreciate it.

152
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:46,455
There were no horse-drawn buses
around here, so you're a life saver.

153
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,832
We need to help each other around here.

154
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:52,544
I actually work as a merchant
in the next village.

155
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:55,213
My family runs an accessory shop.

156
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,674
Would you be interested?

157
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,217
You're quite the businessman.

158
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,970
That doesn't really interest me,

159
00:12:02,637 --> 00:12:05,474
but Fern likes that kind of stuff. Oh?

160
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:08,352
You bought a new bracelet?

161
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:10,854
Um…

162
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:13,106
This was…

163
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,484
That's a cute design.

164
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,362
I have a ring with the same design.

165
00:12:18,445 --> 00:12:21,365
I got it from Himmel.

166
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:22,991
I think it's matching.

167
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,203
-Really?
-Let's see…

168
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:28,080
Where did I put it?

169
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,124
That's weird…

170
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,546
This is what you get for being messy.

171
00:12:37,881 --> 00:12:38,924
Here it is.

172
00:12:51,603 --> 00:12:54,189
I'm sorry. I let my guard down.

173
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,944
Bird monsters are cunning
and skilled at hiding their mana.

174
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:01,655
What should we do?

175
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,284
Once we take down the monster,

176
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,621
can't we somehow
get to safety with flight magic?

177
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:11,832
You can make a wagon float, right?

178
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:13,417
Stark,

179
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,669
have you ever seen a flying wagon?

180
00:13:15,752 --> 00:13:16,837
We're in one right now.

181
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:19,423
It may come as a surprise,

182
00:13:19,506 --> 00:13:22,384
but it's not even been 40 years

183
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,594
since mankind learned how to fly.

184
00:13:25,345 --> 00:13:26,513
<i>Up until then,</i>

185
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:29,349
<i>the sky was monopolized</i>
<i>by demons and monsters.</i>

186
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,102
<i>The flight magic that mankind uses</i>

187
00:13:32,185 --> 00:13:34,729
<i>is just a reproduction of the spell</i>
<i>that demons use.</i>

188
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,023
Enough of the complicated details.

189
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,067
Say it in a way that I can understand.

190
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:44,698
We don't know the logic behind the spell,
so we can't adapt it as we wish.

191
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:49,202
If it's larger than a human,
we can only make it fly for a little bit.

192
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,205
-I see.
-We have no choice but to escape.

193
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:55,500
I'll fly with the merchant.

194
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,211
-Fern, you take Sein.
-Understood.

195
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,255
I'll get our luggage together.

196
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:03,091
Hey, what about me?

197
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,344
-Stark, you jump off.
-What the heck is she saying?

198
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,930
I think I will die.

199
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,349
A warrior wouldn't die from this height.

200
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,393
Of course I'd die!

201
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,604
Why are you looking at me like I'm crazy?

202
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:16,855
That's strange.

203
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,735
<i>Eisen could free fall from any height</i>
<i>and be completely unharmed.</i>

204
00:14:29,701 --> 00:14:31,203
What is wrong with him?

205
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,871
<i>Heiter was left speechless.</i>

206
00:14:32,954 --> 00:14:35,040
The fact that he was left speechless

207
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:37,417
means Master Eisen was not normal.

208
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,129
Then why don't we make the wagon float

209
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,423
right before we hit the ground?

210
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,635
We have to calculate whether we can
counterbalance our free fall.

211
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:51,389
If we can't neutralize the momentum,
we'll become minced meat.

212
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,391
She said something scary right now!

213
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:57,395
Either way, we should probably act fast.

214
00:14:58,021 --> 00:15:02,150
This type of monster hunts
by smashing its prey on the ground.

215
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,402
I see.

216
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,917
<i>You never know unless you try, I guess.</i>

217
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,671
Don't drop us so suddenly!

218
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,686
I'm alive?

219
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,813
It seems it was a success.

220
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,859
-You call this a success?
-What sort of plan was that?

221
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,322
The horse had minor injuries,
but they've been treated.

222
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:52,951
The wagon is in bad shape, though.
We need to repair it.

223
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:56,788
-Sorry…
-Not at all. I'm so grateful.

224
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,332
If I was alone, I'd be dead by now.

225
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,127
We'll be busy
repairing the wagon for a while.

226
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,394
Oh? That's weird…

227
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,314
Where did it go?

228
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,236
It's getting warm these days.

229
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,614
It might be time to change our wardrobes.

230
00:16:30,697 --> 00:16:34,075
By the way,
where did that bracelet come from?

231
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,121
It was a birthday present
from Master Stark.

232
00:16:38,204 --> 00:16:40,790
It took me three hours to pick out.

233
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,460
You ended up picking it yourself?

234
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:45,837
I asked him to pick something out.

235
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,007
I see.

236
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:54,054
That must've been tough, Stark.
That's the hardest position to be in.

237
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:55,639
Tell me about it.

238
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,892
<i>Is this okay?</i>

239
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:02,228
<i>I spent three hours</i>
<i>trying to read her mood.</i>

240
00:17:02,812 --> 00:17:06,608
-It was unbearable.
-Poor you.

241
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:10,153
-<i>I can hear everything.</i>
-But…

242
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,573
I'm glad she likes it.

243
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:21,957
I'm impressed, Stark.

244
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,000
I thought you'd be more cowardly.

245
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:27,170
That design is a mirrored lotus.

246
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:29,506
It means "eternal love."

247
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,968
In this region,
it's something you give your lover.

248
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,764
-Master Stark.
-I… I didn't know!

249
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:39,391
This is a misunderstanding!

250
00:17:39,474 --> 00:17:41,726
Do you think I know
the meaning of flowers?

251
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,062
You have a point. You're stupid after all.

252
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:45,981
She's harsher than usual!

253
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:49,484
You didn't know either.

254
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,862
-Did you say something?
-It's nothing.

255
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,741
Um, should I replace it
with something else?

256
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:01,788
You gave this to me
after thinking long and hard about it.

257
00:18:02,872 --> 00:18:04,499
Don't you ever ask that again.

258
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,585
I'm sorry!

259
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,925
What is it?

260
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,345
It's nothing.

261
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,578
Mistress Frieren.

262
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:26,247
The wagon is all repaired,

263
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,666
so we're leaving early tomorrow morning.

264
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,085
Okay.

265
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,254
You've been sneaking out every night.

266
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,964
What are you looking for?

267
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,467
The ring Himmel gave me.

268
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:39,844
I'll look too.

269
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,972
We'll stay here until we find it.

270
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:44,599
It's fine.

271
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,103
If I don't find it tonight, I'll give up.

272
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,021
I'm used to losing things.

273
00:19:50,855 --> 00:19:53,858
Plus, that wasn't the only thing
I received from Himmel.

274
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:58,321
It was a ring with the same
mirrored lotus design as this, right?

275
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:01,491
Apparently,
that flower means "eternal love."

276
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:03,827
Yeah? I didn't know.

277
00:20:04,702 --> 00:20:05,870
It doesn't matter.

278
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,082
I'm sure Himmel didn't know
about the meaning either.

279
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,458
Even then…

280
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,710
I'm sure it's very precious.

281
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,296
We should all search together.

282
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:20,510
You should have told me!

283
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,889
There were always
people in the village who lost

284
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:26,015
their accessories.

285
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:29,477
It's a spell for finding lost accessories.

286
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:32,647
It's one of the spells that I planned

287
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,566
to give you as this time's reward.

288
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,921
<i>Frieren,</i>

289
00:20:57,964 --> 00:21:01,384
you worked really hard
during this time's subjugation quest.

290
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:03,386
Go ahead and pick whatever you want.

291
00:21:03,469 --> 00:21:05,221
Accessories, huh?

292
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:08,641
I'd rather go to a magic shop.

293
00:21:09,225 --> 00:21:11,769
-This is fine.
-That was fast.

294
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,771
Put some more thought into it.

295
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:17,609
What's wrong?

296
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,570
It's nothing.

297
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,884
Frieren…

298
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:44,510
Thanks.

299
00:22:22,423 --> 00:22:25,677
It's a good thing you didn't give up,
Mistress Frieren.

300
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,061
You might be right.

301
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:42,902
By the way, why is Fern wearing
a mirrored lotus bracelet?

302
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,988
Because Master Stark is stupid.

303
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,615
How mean.

304
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:21,834
<i>-I know spells for combat too.</i>
<i>-I feel anxious.</i>

305
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,503
<i>-He's not as talented as his brother.</i>
<i>-Yes, father.</i>

306
00:24:23,586 --> 00:24:24,670
<i>This isn't good.</i>

307
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,297
<i>-This is hell.</i>
<i>-We should hurry.</i>

308
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,341
<i>"Smells Like Trouble."</i>

309
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:29,801
<i>Let's go to the next village.</i>

310
00:24:29,884 --> 00:24:30,843
