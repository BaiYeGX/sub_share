1
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,309
Hey, Sein!

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:27,526
That mage is willing to take
a photo of us.

3
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,778
A photo?

4
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,322
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,589
Come on, let's go!

6
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:57,223
This is going to be
the beginning of our legend!

7
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,463
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

8
00:02:57,968 --> 00:03:00,763
29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

9
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:02,890
KLAR REGION IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

10
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,268
Is this warrior you mentioned
really strong?

11
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:10,272
He's a dwarf who's been protecting
this village for almost 400 years.

12
00:03:10,856 --> 00:03:14,318
How long do dwarves usually live for?

13
00:03:14,401 --> 00:03:16,278
About 300 years.

14
00:03:17,029 --> 00:03:18,656
People call him Old Man Voll.

15
00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:20,533
He's my long-lived friend.

16
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:24,119
I wanted to have a chat with him
before he dies.

17
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,996
What's sad is that it's not a joke.

18
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,415
But it's true that

19
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,752
there aren't many people
who can talk about the past

20
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,420
with Mistress Frieren.

21
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:37,424
It's nice to make stops like this
on our journey once in a while.

22
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,803
Maybe I'll stay for about ten years?

23
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:42,763
No more than one week.

24
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:05,202
That's the village, huh?

25
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,168
Old Man Voll.

26
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:15,588
Long time no see.

27
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:21,343
Look. Isn't he so cool,
looking like a seasoned old warrior?

28
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,721
He's still considered a warrior?

29
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,851
Who are you again?

30
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,227
He's just a frail old man.

31
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:32,229
I'm Frieren.

32
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,817
That's right…

33
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,238
You're still pretending to be senile?

34
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:52,833
Many people die during battle
because they let their guard down.

35
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:56,962
It is the most effective tactic
against both demons and mankind.

36
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,965
You can't get up, can you?

37
00:05:00,674 --> 00:05:02,718
No matter how experienced a warrior is,

38
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,845
if they lower their defense,

39
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:08,390
they can easily suffer fatal injuries.

40
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,852
If I had unsheathed my blade,

41
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,021
you would've lost your legs.

42
00:05:14,688 --> 00:05:17,650
I see you still use cowardly tactics.

43
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:19,860
Frieren,

44
00:05:20,444 --> 00:05:24,406
I welcome you. Make yourself at home.

45
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,369
Wait, Frieren.

46
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,454
I can't walk.

47
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,667
Stark, have him train you
while you're there.

48
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:36,377
Yes…

49
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,046
What a terrifying old man.

50
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,675
Please use these logs for firewood.

51
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:47,221
Hey, we want to stay for ten years,
so can you find us a job?

52
00:05:47,304 --> 00:05:50,474
Mistress Frieren,
we are staying no more than one week.

53
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:53,018
All right, fine.

54
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,036
We're such a small village…

55
00:06:11,912 --> 00:06:15,124
There was no one to accept my request,
so I'm really grateful.

56
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:17,543
We have nothing to do anyway.

57
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:19,545
My goodness,

58
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,548
I can't believe Old Man Voll had a friend.

59
00:06:23,048 --> 00:06:26,051
I've never seen him
talk so enthusiastically.

60
00:06:27,052 --> 00:06:30,556
He's so senile that we can't even
hold a conversation.

61
00:06:31,932 --> 00:06:35,769
<i>He's been protecting this village from</i>
<i>monsters and demons for ages,</i>

62
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,688
<i>but we don't even know why.</i>

63
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,316
He's like a guardian deity.

64
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:44,737
He's always been alone, huh?

65
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,362
One week just flew by.

66
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:28,364
How is Stark?

67
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:31,617
Humans learn so fast.

68
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,286
He's improved quite a bit.

69
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:35,621
Oh yeah?

70
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,209
It's been fun, Old Man Voll.

71
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,630
I'm really grateful to you, you know.

72
00:07:44,713 --> 00:07:46,465
You gave me

73
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:49,760
the opportunity to get to know
Himmel and everyone.

74
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,056
Old Man Voll,
why are you protecting this village?

75
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:56,767
It's all in the past.

76
00:07:57,559 --> 00:08:00,270
It doesn't matter anymore.

77
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,774
People don't risk their lives for things
that "don't matter."

78
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:08,404
I am only

79
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,698
protecting the village

80
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,784
that my wife loved.

81
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,039
<i>She was a human.</i>

82
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,544
<i>All I am doing is fulfilling a promise</i>

83
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,672
<i>that I made long ago.</i>

84
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,136
But I don't intend to
talk about it in detail.

85
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:35,222
There's no way

86
00:08:35,722 --> 00:08:39,309
I can accurately describe
her face, voice, or gaze anyway.

87
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,938
These memories are for me alone.

88
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:48,652
It must sound silly
that I have been keeping a promise

89
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,030
I made with someone who is already dead.

90
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:54,658
It may.

91
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,454
But I'm sure that person

92
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,999
is happy to know that you are keeping

93
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:03,917
your promise.

94
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:10,382
Himmel, you are a good hero.

95
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,719
I'm sure you will defeat the Demon King.

96
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,099
My wife was also
yearning to live in an era of peace

97
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,810
where there is no Demon King.

98
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:26,023
The great hero named Himmel
will live inside my memory,

99
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:29,026
and I will carry it into the future.

100
00:09:29,651 --> 00:09:31,612
That's very nice of you,

101
00:09:31,695 --> 00:09:34,323
but you don't have to go that far.

102
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:38,535
I have Frieren and Eisen in my party.

103
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,371
I won't live as long as an elf.

104
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,374
Well then, it'll be Frieren's job.

105
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,296
She will carry memories of us
into the future.

106
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:51,173
Isn't that right?

107
00:09:51,673 --> 00:09:53,133
Sure, I don't mind.

108
00:09:54,801 --> 00:09:56,011
I see.

109
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,765
You're blessed with good friends.

110
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,268
Well then, I will have to

111
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:07,314
show Frieren my collection
of handsome poses later.

112
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:10,234
Can I rethink keeping you in my memory?

113
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,241
His collection of handsome poses
was really unnecessary, though.

114
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:19,826
It's a waste of my memory.

115
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:23,914
Do you remember the face of that hero?

116
00:10:25,123 --> 00:10:26,208
Of course, I do.

117
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,085
And his voice?

118
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,089
Don't underestimate me.

119
00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,007
I remember it all.

120
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:38,011
Himmel is the reason why I started
wanting to know about humans.

121
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,974
Just like your reason
for protecting this village,

122
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,017
it's important to me.

123
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,480
I see… The reason, huh?

124
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:53,485
I cannot remember anymore.

125
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:59,283
<i>Neither her face, her voice, nor her gaze.</i>

126
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:02,661
Even still,

127
00:11:02,744 --> 00:11:05,205
I am protecting this village for something

128
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,457
that is important to me.

129
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:13,255
Old Man Voll, you're such a jokester.

130
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:16,842
By the way,

131
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:20,512
where are you all headed to
on this journey?

132
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,808
We're headed for Aureole,
"The land where souls rest."

133
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,893
Where is that?

134
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:30,564
In Ende, where the Demon King's castle is.

135
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:32,357
I see.

136
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:38,155
So you're going to defeat
the Demon King, huh?

137
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:44,703
I can't wait for an era of peace.

138
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,667
Old Man Voll…

139
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,253
the Demon King is already…

140
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,474
What's wrong?

141
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,352
Old Man Voll, I will carry

142
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:11,313
your memories to the future as well.

143
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,523
Okay.

144
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:18,236
That doesn't sound so bad.

145
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:26,328
I'm glad I was able to see you
during the last days of my life.

146
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:30,165
You said the same thing 80 years ago.

147
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:42,427
Bye, Old Man Voll. Take care.

148
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:45,097
Frieren…

149
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:49,476
My wife appeared in my dream.

150
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:51,395
I see.

151
00:12:52,312 --> 00:12:53,688
Maybe it's thanks to

152
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:57,234
the fact that
we reminisced about the past.

153
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:00,570
See you.

154
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,748
29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

155
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,376
ROHR ROAD IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

156
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:26,388
-You had a question?
-I'm looking for someone.

157
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,643
You remember the goal
of my journey, right?

158
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,522
Wasn't it to travel
with a sexy, older lady?

159
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,692
That is important too.

160
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,779
But the goal of my journey is this.

161
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:46,950
To meet my friend who embarked on
a journey ten years ago.

162
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,162
-Oh, that's right.
-Huh?

163
00:13:50,787 --> 00:13:53,415
A photo, huh? That's pretty rare.

164
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,500
<i>We had one taken</i>

165
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,420
<i>by a mage who came</i>
<i>to our village long time ago.</i>

166
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,506
Do you have any leads?

167
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,592
We've been taking the main roads

168
00:14:03,675 --> 00:14:06,094
that go through the northern lands,

169
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:08,805
so I've already met some eyewitnesses.

170
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,058
It should be fine to keep going north.

171
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:19,858
It was ten years ago, right?
How are there still eyewitnesses?

172
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:21,818
He has a unique name, after all.

173
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,987
It leaves an impression.

174
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,072
What's his name?

175
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,575
Gorilla Warrior.

176
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,079
Right…

177
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:35,707
And his real name?

178
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,463
-Real name?
-Were you really best friends?

179
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:43,757
Everyone in the village used to always

180
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,884
call him Gorilla Warrior.

181
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,762
More like, he forced everyone
to call him that.

182
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:50,472
How did that come to be?

183
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,851
By the way, I was called Goatee Priest.

184
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,977
Nobody asked.

185
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,689
Were you called that even before
you grew a goatee?

186
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,983
Are we really going to
expand on this topic?

187
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,610
In any case,

188
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:06,780
as long as you remember
"Gorilla Warrior" that's fine.

189
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:09,241
He will always introduce himself that way.

190
00:15:10,158 --> 00:15:12,702
-What a weird guy.
-Yeah.

191
00:15:13,286 --> 00:15:14,955
He's a weird guy.

192
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:25,882
Once we pass this giant canyon
and walk for about a week,

193
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:29,052
we'll finally reach Äußerst,
the city of magic.

194
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:33,139
This was a really long trip…

195
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,058
Why are you looking at me?

196
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,645
I didn't do anything wrong this time.

197
00:15:39,312 --> 00:15:41,565
Before that, can we stop by this village?

198
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:45,110
The road branches off
into multiple directions here.

199
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:48,071
That's fine. We need to rest as well.

200
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,035
Hey,

201
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,080
did someone named Gorilla
come by here ten years ago?

202
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:59,332
What a crazy thing to ask…

203
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,252
Oh, you mean Gorilla Warrior!

204
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,628
He actually knows?

205
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,132
It left such a strong impression,
I remember it well.

206
00:16:07,215 --> 00:16:10,343
He defeated a monster
that appeared near the village.

207
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,555
Do you know which way he went after that?

208
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:15,765
Let me think…

209
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,727
Master Gorilla

210
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:22,522
was friends with the stubborn old woman
who lives up on the hill,

211
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,065
so try asking her.

212
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,611
Stubborn old woman?
That's another unique nickname.

213
00:16:28,111 --> 00:16:31,531
I am stubborn by nature.

214
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,326
So I can't give you information so easily.

215
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:36,202
She admits that she's stubborn?

216
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:38,288
What can we do?

217
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:46,296
I will have you fulfill
a few requests for me.

218
00:16:47,088 --> 00:16:50,050
First, deliver this letter to Nagel,
the blacksmith

219
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,928
who lives in the next town over.

220
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,182
I'm like an errand boy.

221
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,060
This reminds me of my journey with Himmel.

222
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,687
You did these kinds of things too?

223
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,525
We would help others by
running errands almost every day.

224
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,110
Those kinds of errands

225
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,740
<i>tend to turn into more troublesome</i>
<i>searches and monster exterminations.</i>

226
00:17:14,574 --> 00:17:16,409
<i>Don't say that or it might happen.</i>

227
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,081
Anyway, let's do our best
so she opens up her heart to us.

228
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:51,111
This old woman
isn't opening her heart at all.

229
00:17:51,194 --> 00:17:53,738
She lives up to her name,
"stubborn old woman."

230
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,448
Sorry…

231
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:59,744
If Himmel or Heiter were here,
she would've opened up in half a day.

232
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,748
After all,
nobody in this party has people skills.

233
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,375
Here.

234
00:18:06,042 --> 00:18:06,960
Huh?

235
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,004
It's the last one.

236
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:12,382
Polish the statue of heroes in the canyon.

237
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:16,928
Follow me. I will show you the way.

238
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,015
What's this "statue of heroes"?

239
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:23,143
It's a stone statue of heroes
who are said to have

240
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:25,270
saved the world long ago.

241
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,106
That's all I know about it.

242
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,986
They're forgotten heroes
whose names we don't even know.

243
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,613
The villagers have been
maintaining it for generations.

244
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:38,324
Forgotten heroes, huh?

245
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:41,661
By the way,
you are Goatee Priest, aren't you?

246
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,746
Huh?

247
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,789
How do you know?

248
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,545
We're here.

249
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,549
A priest and a warrior?

250
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,302
It looks pretty old.

251
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:00,847
It kind of looks like
Master Sein and Master Gorilla.

252
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:05,185
More like, that warrior looks so familiar.

253
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,813
-It's Kraft.
-Oh?

254
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,816
-You're right!
-It looks exactly like him.

255
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,530
Well then, let's get started.

256
00:19:23,161 --> 00:19:25,330
-Sein?
-I see.

257
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:28,917
So his name is Kraft, huh?

258
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:32,337
-What about this one?
-I don't know.

259
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,798
I see…

260
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,261
What's this statue?

261
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,639
Don't they look exactly like us?

262
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:47,560
According to the village chief, they
are heroes from a long, long time ago.

263
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,854
But nobody even remembers their names.

264
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,816
We won't become like them.

265
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:54,859
I'd hate to be forgotten.

266
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,862
We'll become heroes

267
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,365
that nobody can forget,
like Himmel the Hero.

268
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,955
No matter how great of a hero you are,
you will be forgotten one day.

269
00:20:07,455 --> 00:20:10,250
Even Himmel the Hero,
who defeated the Demon King,

270
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,876
is no exception.

271
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,799
That makes sense.
Of course, it's not possible.

272
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,347
Will I turn out like this
if I work out too?

273
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,892
Gorilla Warrior!

274
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,728
That will be my name from today!

275
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:34,649
Why?

276
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,527
If I want to become an unforgettable hero,

277
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,779
my name should leave an impression.

278
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:45,368
That is true.

279
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:50,165
Then you would be Goatee Priest.

280
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:55,712
That's great!

281
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,549
I'm sure you will look good in a goatee.

282
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,890
Finally, it's done…

283
00:21:07,473 --> 00:21:09,017
That was a lot of work.

284
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,228
If only it was a bronze statue,
we could've used magic.

285
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,899
I asked Gorilla to do the same thing,

286
00:21:15,982 --> 00:21:19,485
but he couldn't do it this well.

287
00:21:20,236 --> 00:21:22,530
Fighting is his only strong suit.

288
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:26,784
But his name did indeed,
leave a strong impression.

289
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,790
Gorilla always talked about you.

290
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:37,587
<i>He said that the two of you</i>
<i>will become heroes whose names</i>

291
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,173
will be engraved in history forever.

292
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,654
Did you find out where Gorilla went?

293
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:05,615
Tür.

294
00:22:06,324 --> 00:22:08,618
<i>It's a trade city in the northern lands.</i>

295
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:09,535
NORTHEM LANDS - TÜR

296
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,621
<i>It's farther east from here.</i>

297
00:22:12,288 --> 00:22:14,874
In the opposite direction from Äußerst.

298
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,252
Yeah.

299
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,925
What should I do…

300
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:57,226
<i>Come into</i>

301
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,062
-<i>the</i><i>room next door, one at a time.</i>
<i>-You should rest.</i>

302
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:00,646
<i>-Mediating is a priest's job.</i>
<i>-The medicine is ready.</i>

303
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,731
<i>It's embarrassing.</i>

304
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:04,275
<i>I'm so thoughtful and handsome, aren't I?</i>

305
00:24:04,358 --> 00:24:05,860
<i>"Take Care."</i>

306
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:06,944
