1
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:08,466
No wonder the Ruins of the King's Tomb
were impregnable.

2
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:14,597
Who knew we'd run into
something like this?

3
00:00:23,397 --> 00:00:24,231
Denken,

4
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:26,734
is that something you can deal with?

5
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,742
There's one thing I can say for certain.

6
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:40,456
If this weren't an exam,
I would've already broken my bottle.

7
00:00:54,887 --> 00:00:58,391
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

8
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:32,276
We call the lord of that dungeon Spiegel,

9
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,737
the Water-Mirror Fiend.

10
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:39,075
It's a monster from mythical times
that comes out

11
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,410
in Ewig the Sage's heroic tales.

12
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,830
We believe that

13
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,793
Spiegel reads the memories
of those who enter the dungeon

14
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:52,922
and creates a clone of them.

15
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:57,551
There are modern-day monsters with

16
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,179
<i>similar traits, like the Einsam.</i>

17
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:04,308
But the clones that Spiegel creates
are tangible

18
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:06,227
and perfectly copy people's

19
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,522
abilities, mana, and even techniques.

20
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,693
That is why the Ruins of the King's Tomb
is still uncharted.

21
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:19,156
Why did Sense choose
this dungeon as the exam location?

22
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,409
Fighting your clone means
fighting an evenly-matched opponent.

23
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,538
Calm self-analysis and teamwork
is necessary

24
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:29,124
in order to defeat the clones
without any casualties.

25
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,758
This exam is very fitting
for a pacifist like her.

26
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,560
This is bad…

27
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,270
Let's retreat.

28
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,613
Denken!

29
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,616
Well then…

30
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,994
What shall we do?

31
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,087
A dead end, huh?

32
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:17,548
I guess we're cornered.

33
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:29,935
Four-eyes,

34
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,772
I want to hear your opinion,
as an expert in cloning magic.

35
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,024
Do you mind?

36
00:04:35,983 --> 00:04:39,403
As I've said before, my name is Land.

37
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,281
Well, whatever…

38
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,790
How perfect
of a copy is that clone of mine?

39
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:55,002
Übel, you're the type

40
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:58,422
who is talkative
even during a battle, aren't you?

41
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,301
{\an8}It's like you'd die if you stayed quiet.

42
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:05,638
Good observation.

43
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:09,016
Yeah, I might die.

44
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,396
That thing is silent.

45
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:20,736
I guess it hasn't copied
my memories or personality.

46
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:24,823
No, it probably just can't speak.

47
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,576
<i>During the first attack,</i>

48
00:05:28,327 --> 00:05:30,204
<i>it pulled out the bottle</i>

49
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,707
<i>with the evacuation golem</i>
<i>out of my pocket.</i>

50
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:40,255
I see.

51
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,549
That is indeed something I would do.

52
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,594
It's also knowledgeable about us.

53
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:50,140
The reason why it's not attacking us
even though we're cornered

54
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,519
is because it's wary of your Sorganeil.

55
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:59,108
Or it just enjoys watching people suffer.

56
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,861
That's not funny.

57
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,658
You're bleeding a lot.

58
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:12,830
Four-eyes, you're not going to
last very long at this rate.

59
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:15,124
Yeah…

60
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,585
Can I ask you one last thing?

61
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,048
{\an8}Are you the real Four-eyes?

62
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,301
{\an8}Who knows?

63
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:28,053
{\an8}I wonder…

64
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:37,563
Use my bottle.

65
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,068
That is for your own survival.

66
00:06:43,777 --> 00:06:44,903
Interesting…

67
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:46,905
I see.

68
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,909
Well then, Four-eyes,
wait here for a second.

69
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:54,747
I'll get your bottle back.

70
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,999
Hey, wait--

71
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:06,091
<i>Of course, it will come towards me.</i>

72
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:08,969
<i>In order to use Sorganeil,</i>

73
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:11,513
<i>the target's entire body</i>
<i>must be within view.</i>

74
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:18,354
<i>The first one to miscalculate the distance</i>
<i>between us will lose.</i>

75
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:27,321
<i>If our abilities are equal,</i>
<i>winning and losing is up to luck.</i>

76
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,991
<i>Luck has never been on my side,</i>

77
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,286
<i>so I hate fights that depend on luck.</i>

78
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:41,210
<i>That's why I have no interest</i>
<i>in fighting myself.</i>

79
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:43,128
My goodness…

80
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,714
I'm just helplessly suicidal, aren't I?

81
00:07:55,265 --> 00:07:57,434
<i>As usual, I'm unlucky.</i>

82
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,103
<i>This is why I hate these things…</i>

83
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,065
But

84
00:08:03,857 --> 00:08:07,236
it seems you were
even more unlucky than me.

85
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:11,365
Four-eyes, that was surprisingly fast.

86
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,088
As I thought,
the bottle was fake too, huh?

87
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,306
Übel,

88
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,060
you knew that it was my clone
who was fatally injured?

89
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,688
Why did you put your life in danger?

90
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:46,483
I guess it's because I was convinced
that you'd come for me.

91
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:50,571
Did I come across as such a nice guy?

92
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:53,115
No, not at all.

93
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:56,160
More like, that's not relevant at all.

94
00:08:57,494 --> 00:08:58,829
Four-eyes,

95
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:02,249
you didn't even try to accept my bottle.

96
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,339
You don't want anyone
to die because of you, am I right?

97
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:11,425
That's why I created

98
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:15,429
a situation in which I would die
because of you.

99
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:20,309
Thank you, Four-eyes.

100
00:09:20,392 --> 00:09:23,479
I feel like I got to know you
a little better.

101
00:09:24,062 --> 00:09:26,607
Is that right? Good for you.

102
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,151
Do you feel like you can relate to me yet?

103
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,946
I'll probably need some more time.

104
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:42,080
I'm pretty sure we're near
the innermost depths…

105
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:47,002
Mistress Frieren, I see stairs over there.

106
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:53,383
Fern, show me the map.

107
00:09:55,594 --> 00:09:58,764
I think we've explored
every corner of this floor.

108
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:13,612
There's a hidden room behind this wall.

109
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:16,240
I'm sure there are treasures.

110
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,369
Judging from this atmosphere,
there's a possibility

111
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:23,789
that a rare grimoire is hidden in here.

112
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,875
But there was nothing that looked

113
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,877
like an entrance anywhere.

114
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,255
True…

115
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,385
But according to the layout,

116
00:10:36,468 --> 00:10:39,304
there definitely should be a room here.

117
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:34,985
Mistress Frieren, this is amazing!

118
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:46,204
It depicts the achievements of the king
who was buried here.

119
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,835
I have never seen a mural from
the Unified Dynasty era in such

120
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:52,878
pristine condition.

121
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:55,630
This is a valuable find.

122
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,470
It's magnificent.

123
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:19,112
This raid is almost going
a little too smoothly.

124
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,200
We might just
pass the exam before we know it.

125
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,243
That might be.

126
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:33,585
What's wrong? Why are you gathered here?

127
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:36,046
Guessing from the layout,

128
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:40,133
the innermost depths
should be somewhere beyond this hall.

129
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,593
So?

130
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,223
It's been half a day since that thing
stationed itself there.

131
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:56,358
Things are starting to get fun.

132
00:12:57,192 --> 00:12:59,986
{\an8}Now this is how dungeon raids
are supposed be.

133
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:07,160
A perfect clone, huh?

134
00:13:08,161 --> 00:13:12,374
That thing
seems to be just as strong as me.

135
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,794
Unless we do something about that clone,

136
00:13:15,877 --> 00:13:18,255
we can't make it to the innermost depth.

137
00:13:18,755 --> 00:13:20,549
Do you have any suggestions?

138
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:22,884
Let's see…

139
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:27,347
If that thing is a perfect replica of me,

140
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:31,059
its weakness would be the same
as a real life mage.

141
00:13:31,768 --> 00:13:34,479
To defeat a mage of a higher caliber,

142
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,816
one would use
a restraining spell or hypnosis magic.

143
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,944
I'm resistant to both, though.

144
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:44,656
But it might create
a window of opportunity.

145
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:49,578
You should be able to seize that
opportunity and defeat it.

146
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,580
Methode,

147
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:54,624
you're skilled in those kinds of tricks.

148
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,211
I wouldn't call myself "skilled" but…

149
00:14:00,547 --> 00:14:02,132
Excuse me.

150
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:11,349
How intriguing…

151
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:14,311
My restraining spell won't work on you.

152
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:15,395
You smell good.

153
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,689
This should work on anyone unless

154
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:19,357
there's a significant difference in mana.

155
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,902
Frieren,

156
00:14:22,402 --> 00:14:24,863
please look into my eyes next.

157
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:31,953
Hypnosis magic doesn't work either.

158
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,917
I am not able to
break Frieren's mental defense.

159
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:38,752
Oh my…

160
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,756
I guess she really is resistant to both.

161
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:47,719
But although her mental defense
is complex and strong,

162
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,388
it seems to be a very old system.

163
00:14:50,972 --> 00:14:55,769
An expert in hypnosis magic
may be able to find its weakness.

164
00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:58,647
Can you think of anyone
among the examinees?

165
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,987
Edel, the second-class mage,
may be able to.

166
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:10,700
But unlike me,
she has absolutely no combat skills,

167
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,745
so I honestly don't know
if she can make it this far.

168
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,874
And first of all,

169
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,128
hypnosis magic doesn't have any effect
unless the target has a mind.

170
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,672
Who knows

171
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:27,300
if the clones are replicated
to that extent.

172
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:31,847
We don't have enough information.

173
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,019
Edel, what do you think that is?

174
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:46,319
Who knows?

175
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,781
But there is no doubt that
it is just as powerful

176
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,033
as Sense, the first-class mage.

177
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,079
We can't conceal our mana
and hide here forever.

178
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,914
We'll have to defeat it.

179
00:15:58,665 --> 00:16:01,209
You think you can defeat it, Blei?

180
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,669
I know I'm out of the question,

181
00:16:02,752 --> 00:16:06,756
but even you and Dünste can
barely fight inside this dungeon.

182
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:09,676
Modern magic isn't meant to be

183
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,012
used to fight in dungeons to begin with.

184
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:14,347
That's because most dungeons

185
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:18,059
were already done being raided
during the Demon King's era.

186
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:23,940
And we focus too much of our resources
on powerful defensive magic.

187
00:16:24,816 --> 00:16:29,446
<i>We've begun to rely more on</i>
<i>natural elements for offensive magic.</i>

188
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:33,074
Because rather than creating
something out of nothing,

189
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,494
it takes up less mana
to manipulate or transform

190
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:40,916
elements that are already
accessible around us.

191
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:45,670
And in that sense,
that thing is very efficient.

192
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:50,300
Its hair is covered in multiple
layers of magic.

193
00:16:50,967 --> 00:16:53,553
It's safe to assume
that it has numerous ways

194
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:56,139
of fighting even inside this dungeon.

195
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:02,812
In my opinion,
we can't win against that thing.

196
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:06,107
Magic is all about visualization.

197
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,654
The fact that it can freely
transform and manipulate

198
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:13,823
each strand of hair,
which is impossible to even count,

199
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:18,078
means its ability to visualize is
beyond any normal human being.

200
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:22,290
That in itself makes it
a far superior mage than us.

201
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:27,087
Honestly, it's a miracle that we were
able to evade it this far.

202
00:17:29,172 --> 00:17:31,007
We did our best.

203
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,886
First of all, we aren't even fighters.

204
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,097
It's time to call it quits.

205
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:42,143
To be honest, I'm scared
and want to go home.

206
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:43,895
Edel,

207
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:46,690
your voice won't reach it?

208
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:51,528
I may be from a clan which
makes a living off of hypnosis magic,

209
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:52,612
but there is no way

210
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:56,700
I can meet the requirements to
use high-level orders against that thing.

211
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,952
At best, I'd only be able

212
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:02,205
to make it kneel
and create a window of opportunity.

213
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:06,042
Even to do that, I'd have to
look into its eyes and talk to it.

214
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:08,962
So it's not impossible?

215
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:12,215
Only if it has a mind.

216
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,843
How much time do we need to buy?

217
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,886
Fifteen seconds.

218
00:18:17,512 --> 00:18:19,723
You probably can't buy any more than that.

219
00:18:20,932 --> 00:18:22,225
What do you mean?

220
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:28,690
You will find out soon.

221
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,748
Surround us with defensive magic.

222
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:45,999
What?

223
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,710
In modern magic battles,

224
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:51,629
there are two ways to break through
defensive magic.

225
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,965
Either shatter it using sheer mass

226
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,135
or slip past it using technique.

227
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,014
Those with many tricks up their sleeve
usually use the latter.

228
00:19:03,683 --> 00:19:04,517
How surprising…

229
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,395
Who knew it would use both methods.

230
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,731
It's as powerful as a giant!

231
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,818
I thought a complete barrier of

232
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,780
defensive magic
would last a maximum of 15 seconds.

233
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,033
But who knew it would
give out even sooner.

234
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,329
But now we've made eye contact.

235
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:28,291
The more skilled a mage gets,
the more they look at their opponent.

236
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:31,127
Kneel!

237
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,303
{\an8}I see…

238
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:41,888
{\an8}Now I understand.

239
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,182
It doesn't have a mind.

240
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:49,145
It's just imitating the workings
of a mind very precisely.

241
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:53,650
There is no way for us to win against it.

242
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:58,196
We have no choice but to rely on others.

243
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:01,908
Run with all your might and find
those who can fight.

244
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:04,911
Like I said, it's time to call it quits
and go home.

245
00:20:05,578 --> 00:20:07,622
I don't want to feel any more pain.

246
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,170
How handy.

247
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,840
You're even going to protect me from harm?

248
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,512
We should run too.

249
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:29,519
At this rate, will anyone be able to reach
the innermost depth unharmed?

250
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,104
Didn't I call it?

251
00:20:31,604 --> 00:20:35,608
She never intended to let anyone
pass the exam in the first place.

252
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,378
Since we have such little information,

253
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,673
we should prepare just in case
it doesn't have a mind.

254
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:02,218
In that case, we'll have to
use sheer force.

255
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,054
Is that possible?

256
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,806
I don't know.

257
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:25,325
Jeez…

258
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:28,161
I can't even tell what they're thinking.

259
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:41,799
<i>But just as I thought,</i>
<i>we work pretty well together.</i>

260
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:52,143
<i>If it's a simple</i>
<i>head-to-head battle of mana,</i>

261
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,270
<i>Ehre can overpower Scharf and I.</i>

262
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:05,740
<i>However,</i>

263
00:22:07,325 --> 00:22:09,661
<i>I know how to win.</i>

264
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,004
No matter who I'm against

265
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:24,175
or what the circumstances are.

266
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,555
By sheer force, huh?

267
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:34,394
Um, in that case…

268
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:39,899
I might be able to kill Mistress Frieren.

269
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,445
-Yeah?
-Yes.

270
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:46,155
Well then,

271
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,992
{\an8}let's draft up a plan.

272
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,876
<i>-It's coming together.</i>
<i>-Let's draft up a plan.</i>

273
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,419
<i>-So you had information.</i>
<i>-Shall I help?</i>

274
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,629
<i>I think you should apologize.</i>

275
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:26,005
<i>-It has no weakness.</i>
<i>-How unpleasant.</i>

276
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,507
<i>You look like you're having fun.</i>

277
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:29,884
<i>"A Fatal Vulnerability."</i>

278
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,969
