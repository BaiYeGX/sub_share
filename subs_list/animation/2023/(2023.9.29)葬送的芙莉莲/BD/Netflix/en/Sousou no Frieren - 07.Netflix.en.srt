1
00:00:01,542 --> 00:00:05,087
The Great Mage Flamme's grimoire?

2
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:09,342
All books said to be written by Flamme
are known to be fake.

3
00:00:09,842 --> 00:00:13,137
All of the grimoires they've discovered
have been counterfeits.

4
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:17,642
This might be
the best counterfeit I've ever seen.

5
00:00:18,142 --> 00:00:21,312
It's not a bad reward
for a subjugation quest.

6
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:23,397
I have no idea what's good about that.

7
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:27,276
But when there are
so many fake ones out there,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,947
you start to doubt
if a real one really exists.

9
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:35,201
The existence of Flamme,
the founder of humanity's magic,

10
00:00:35,284 --> 00:00:37,662
is like a fairy tale in itself.

11
00:00:38,162 --> 00:00:39,497
A fairy tale, huh?

12
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,542
I guess so…

13
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,212
That goes to show
how much time has passed.

14
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,215
I'm probably the only one who remembers

15
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:51,676
what she looked like.

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,353
It's morning?

17
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,402
Mistress Frieren woke up early!

18
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:11,320
Is that a big deal?

19
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:12,989
Of course it is.

20
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:16,826
You have to commend her when this happens.

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,835
<i>What's going on?</i>

22
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:30,381
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

23
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,187
28 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

24
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,606
ENG ROAD IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

25
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,150
What a lifesaver.

26
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:17,530
With this road blocked,
I was completely out of options.

27
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,037
Hey…

28
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,623
Do we have to do this?

29
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:31,043
Are you not happy with it?
The reward is not bad.

30
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:33,045
That's not what I mean.

31
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:36,173
Can't you magically move the wagon
to the other side?

32
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,176
That won't be helpful
for others who pass through.

33
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,637
That's what Fern said.

34
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,307
You're so selfish, Stark.

35
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,226
You're the last person who can say that.

36
00:03:51,313 --> 00:03:54,859
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Oh, thanks.

37
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,075
By the way…

38
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,036
why is there so much rubble here?

39
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:08,164
In the northern lands,

40
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:12,376
some areas are
still in a state of war with demons.

41
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,713
This must be the effects of that.

42
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:18,924
The aftermath of war, huh?

43
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:24,430
Master Stark,

44
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:28,809
can you leave that side for later
and help me with this please?

45
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:32,897
Master Stark?

46
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:37,443
Hey, can you stop
calling me "Master Stark"?

47
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,070
It makes me uncomfortable.

48
00:04:40,779 --> 00:04:42,448
We're almost the same age, right?

49
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,745
I see… All right.

50
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,124
Stark, hurry up and help me. Chop chop!

51
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,083
So bossy!

52
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,754
That's not what I meant.

53
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:58,672
There are other ways.

54
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,091
-Other honorifics that you can use.
-Right…

55
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,136
Also, try to be a little more friendly.

56
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,347
I get hurt easily.

57
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:09,350
-This guy is such a pain.
-"This guy"?

58
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:11,852
Are you getting work done?

59
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:14,897
Let's hurry up, Master Stark.

60
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,483
Yes…

61
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,154
Wow, thank you so much.

62
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,324
If you don't mind,
I can show you the way to town.

63
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,577
An elf, huh?

64
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:33,499
I've been alive for a long time,
but you're the first one I've ever met.

65
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:35,459
I guess we're pretty rare.

66
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:39,129
Now that you mention it, I have never met

67
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,006
an elf other than Mistress Frieren.

68
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,092
We're small in number.

69
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,846
I've only met a handful
of fellow elves myself.

70
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:51,308
Elves live for a long time,

71
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,019
but we've lost all things
like romantic feelings

72
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,188
and reproductive instincts.

73
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,817
We're slowly becoming extinct.

74
00:06:00,317 --> 00:06:04,071
The last time I met a fellow elf
was more than 400 years ago.

75
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,533
<i>Our end may be nearer than I thought.</i>

76
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,002
We can see the town now.

77
00:06:19,878 --> 00:06:21,630
There's a line of wagons.

78
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,924
Those are merchants.

79
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,135
Tonight is the Liberation Festival.

80
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:29,888
Today was the day Himmel the Hero
and his party

81
00:06:30,472 --> 00:06:35,644
<i>defeated the demon that had</i>
<i>control over this region.</i>

82
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:38,731
Did we do something like that?

83
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,901
The Liberation Festival
is a commemoration of that day.

84
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:48,198
<i>We decorate the statues of Master Himmel</i>
<i>and his party in the town square</i>

85
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,368
<i>and the entire town joins</i>
<i>in a grand celebration.</i>

86
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:54,329
Humans are so over the top.

87
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,041
They turn everything into a festival.

88
00:06:57,124 --> 00:07:02,046
The demon was defeated
more than 80 years ago.

89
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,840
That's enough time

90
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:08,802
for humans to forget about something.

91
00:07:10,262 --> 00:07:11,805
Despite that,

92
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,016
even if it's just this one day,

93
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:17,144
everyone remembers what
Master Himmel and his party did.

94
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,816
Yes, splendid job.

95
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,403
Five retakes, huh?

96
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,906
It ended early this time.

97
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,910
Himmel, you're always
making statues of yourself.

98
00:07:33,702 --> 00:07:36,413
I want everyone to remember.

99
00:07:37,456 --> 00:07:41,085
Unlike you, we won't live very long.

100
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:46,632
I have to let the future generations know
how handsome I am.

101
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,258
Let's return to the inn.

102
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,763
But the biggest reason is…

103
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,018
so that you're not left all alone
in the future.

104
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:01,146
What?

105
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:04,024
It's not a fairy tale.

106
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,278
We existed in real life.

107
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,911
Like this, we commemorate the deeds

108
00:08:15,994 --> 00:08:19,665
of Himmel the Hero
and his party each year.

109
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,711
Now that I look at it,
you look just like the statue

110
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,673
of Mistress Frieren
from the party of heroes.

111
00:08:29,883 --> 00:08:33,053
Will this still be held
100 years from now?

112
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:36,348
As long as this town exists.

113
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,808
How about 1,000 years?

114
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,312
That… I can't say for sure.

115
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,404
All right, let's go.

116
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:53,615
To the northernmost point we go.

117
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:55,784
Now that I think about it,

118
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,704
I never asked about
the destination of this journey.

119
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,706
Where is it?

120
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,626
Heaven.

121
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,087
That sounds fun.

122
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:11,133
28 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

123
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,927
GRAF GRANAT'S DOMAIN IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

124
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,815
There are so many guards.

125
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,692
Did something happen?

126
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,946
Anyway, let's just decide
who is going to buy what.

127
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,789
Mistress Frieren,
we're in the middle of the town.

128
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,666
It's a demon.

129
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,679
What are you doing!

130
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,813
Graf Granat,

131
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,399
did you plan this?

132
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,527
Lord Lügner,

133
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:15,572
it is true that I despise you
enough to want to kill you.

134
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:17,157
However,

135
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,619
I am not foolish enough
to kill a messenger of peace

136
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:21,828
in broad daylight.

137
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:23,872
Messenger of peace?

138
00:10:24,998 --> 00:10:28,752
She's most likely an adventurer
who doesn't know our situation.

139
00:10:29,753 --> 00:10:31,880
I'll take your word for it.

140
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:38,512
You have calm, cold eyes filled with
murderous intent.

141
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:44,768
Even the citizens of this town
who despise us

142
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:47,604
look at me as a human,

143
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,606
albeit with fear.

144
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:56,113
But you look at me
as if you are looking at a beast.

145
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:58,824
And that's what you are.

146
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:01,743
You demons mimic human voices
but you're nothing but

147
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,788
beasts with whom we cannot communicate.

148
00:11:06,498 --> 00:11:08,709
Put her in the dungeon.

149
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,627
Yes, sir.

150
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:13,714
Huh?

151
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,634
Hey!

152
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:34,401
I'm bored.

153
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,157
Mistress Frieren…

154
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:43,076
They said to repent for
two to three years.

155
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,495
That's shorter than I thought.

156
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,248
Bring me a grimoire later.

157
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:54,212
Mistress Frieren, you really love to
waste time, don't you?

158
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:57,174
I'm not here because I want to be.

159
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,928
So, why are they calling demons
"messengers of peace"?

160
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,931
We did some research
while doing our shopping.

161
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,060
You know Aura the Guillotine, right?

162
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:12,773
The greater demon and one of
the Seven Sages of Destruction, right?

163
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,484
While fighting with us,

164
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:19,071
she lost most of her servants
and went missing.

165
00:12:19,696 --> 00:12:21,281
Did something happen recently?

166
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,786
Aura regained power 28 years ago.

167
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:27,496
<i>This town has</i>

168
00:12:27,579 --> 00:12:31,041
<i>been fighting with her army</i>
<i>for a long time, apparently.</i>

169
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,503
<i>But Aura, who became tired</i>
<i>of meaningless massacres,</i>

170
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,838
<i>requested peace be made.</i>

171
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,425
And so they accepted
her messengers of peace?

172
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,052
That was a bad move.

173
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:45,347
It's futile to talk to demons.

174
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,810
It can't be totally futile.
We have the ability to speak.

175
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:53,313
If we can settle things by negotiating,
that will be best.

176
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:56,400
We can't settle things,
that's why it's futile.

177
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,695
Demons are human-eating creatures.

178
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,909
Have you ever wondered why
they use the same language as mankind?

179
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:13,125
My Hero, kill it at once!

180
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,631
It's still a child.

181
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:21,758
So what if it is?

182
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:25,345
It ate our daughter alive!

183
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,727
It hurts…

184
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,690
It hurts…

185
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,609
Mom…

186
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,660
That's enough. I will do it.

187
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:52,581
At this rate, we're the same as demons.

188
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:59,296
It's not like they cannot survive
without eating humans, right?

189
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:03,341
Why don't we give it a chance to atone?

190
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:05,093
Chief…

191
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,511
Don't be ridiculous!

192
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,765
My daughter… Give me back my daughter!

193
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,355
Let's treat your wounds.

194
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,944
I was just looking for someone
to help me in the field.

195
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,784
Himmel, if you don't kill it now,
you will regret it.

196
00:14:28,867 --> 00:14:29,701
After all, it--

197
00:14:30,535 --> 00:14:33,705
Frieren, we have the ability to speak.

198
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,958
We'll be staying in this village anyway.

199
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,543
Let's see how it goes.

200
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,255
I see…

201
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,124
Why did you kill the chief?

202
00:15:24,172 --> 00:15:25,924
I knew it.

203
00:15:26,007 --> 00:15:27,884
We should have killed it back then.

204
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,345
There you go again.

205
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:36,852
I could feel
your murderous intent every day.

206
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,397
I want to live peacefully.

207
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:43,149
That's why I prepared this.

208
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,277
This will replace

209
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,071
your daughter that I ate.

210
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,576
She is the chief's daughter.

211
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,829
The chief is gone now.

212
00:16:02,502 --> 00:16:07,215
It seems as though
I made the wrong decision.

213
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,677
Oh well, I'll use her as a hostage--

214
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,103
You won't stop me now, right?

215
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,439
No…

216
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:24,357
Mom…

217
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:32,741
"Mom" again, huh?

218
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:37,495
Like monsters, child-rearing is not
a part of demon culture.

219
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:41,875
After they are born, they spend
most of their time alone.

220
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,421
Solitude is part of your nature

221
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,591
and the concept of family
doesn't exist for you.

222
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:51,259
So why

223
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,512
do you use the word, "Mom"?

224
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,223
That way

225
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,976
you can't kill me.

226
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:04,814
It's a beautiful word
that works like magic.

227
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:12,197
To them, words are just tools
for deceiving mankind.

228
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:15,241
The Great Mage Flamme

229
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,244
defined demons as monsters who can speak.

230
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,082
They're descendants of monsters who would

231
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:26,086
hide in the shadows and say,
"help me" to lure in prey.

232
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,219
Bring me gifts.

233
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,893
Graf Granat is late.

234
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,437
It's a diplomatic strategy of mankind.

235
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:49,067
More than that,
I'm curious about that mage.

236
00:17:50,193 --> 00:17:51,778
<i>That face is so familiar…</i>

237
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,450
Beasts with whom
we cannot communicate, huh?

238
00:17:58,493 --> 00:18:00,704
What a perfect way to put it.

239
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:03,289
She is the only one in this town

240
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,209
who understands
the true nature of us demons.

241
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:09,504
There is only one reason for predators

242
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:12,966
who prey on humans
to speak the human language.

243
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,553
They aren't words for mutual understanding

244
00:18:16,636 --> 00:18:18,471
but words for deception.

245
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,142
This town won't last very long.

246
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:25,228
I'll escape once the chaos ensues.

247
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:34,446
And this is?

248
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,240
My son's room.

249
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,329
He was such a good kid.

250
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,750
He would always say
that he'd soon take over

251
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,170
as head of the family
and let me take it easy.

252
00:18:57,385 --> 00:19:01,056
When he fought a match before the king,
he was bestowed with this sword.

253
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,975
Where is your son now?

254
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:11,483
He died ten years ago,
in the battle with Aura.

255
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,701
All that returned was this sword.

256
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,578
Lügner!

257
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,959
I only allowed you in
so I could avenge my son.

258
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,837
I will kill all of you messengers here.

259
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,465
Your peace negotiations can kiss my ass!

260
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,479
This room has been thoroughly cleaned.

261
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,566
I bet it hasn't changed at all
from ten years ago.

262
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,444
What about it?

263
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,657
I also keep my father's room
the way it was when he was

264
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,450
killed by you people.

265
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,705
Why don't we stop this, Graf Granat?

266
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:11,084
Or do you want to continue shedding blood

267
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:14,129
and bring more sadness upon people?

268
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,843
We have the ability to speak.

269
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:22,720
Please give us
an opportunity to talk it out.

270
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,276
Show them to the drawing room.

271
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,491
I need to think about it.

272
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:53,751
Master Lügner,

273
00:20:54,335 --> 00:20:55,920
what is a "father"?

274
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,339
Who knows?

275
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:11,477
Graf Granat
seems to have a grudge against us,

276
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,855
but he also seems to be empathetic.

277
00:21:15,523 --> 00:21:17,817
If we can get him on our side,

278
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,821
we can make him remove the defense barrier
as a sign of peace.

279
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,657
<i>Then Mistress Aura's army</i>

280
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,409
<i>will destroy this town.</i>

281
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:31,998
By the way, Linie,

282
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:35,210
I don't see Draht anywhere.

283
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,254
He said he'd get rid of a nuisance.

284
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,924
He got ahead of himself.

285
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:44,260
Young ones are so hot‐blooded.
What can I do?

286
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,015
Lord Draht!

287
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:52,268
We cannot have you in a place like this.

288
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:54,187
Please return--

289
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:08,743
Who are you?
It's outside of visiting hours.

290
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,331
I am Draht, a servant

291
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:16,292
and executioner of Aura the Guillotine.

292
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:18,795
I'm here to kill you.

293
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,130
I see.

294
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,299
You're done playing diplomat?

295
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:25,176
It's just beginning.

296
00:22:27,428 --> 00:22:29,555
<i>According to Lord Lügner,</i>

297
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,141
<i>this girl is our only obstacle.</i>

298
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:34,102
<i>If I get rid of her,</i>

299
00:22:34,185 --> 00:22:36,813
<i>all we have to do is win over Graf Granat</i>

300
00:22:37,313 --> 00:22:39,065
<i>and this town will easily fall.</i>

301
00:22:40,566 --> 00:22:43,069
Just to let you know, I'm strong.

302
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:45,780
Stronger than me?

303
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,117
Stronger than Aura the Guillotine.

304
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,877
<i>Who is that mage?</i>

305
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,920
<i>Killing a guard is</i>

306
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:25,129
<i>worthy of capital punishment.</i>

307
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,840
<i>The mage who has killed</i>

308
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,926
<i>the most demons in history.</i>

309
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:30,968
