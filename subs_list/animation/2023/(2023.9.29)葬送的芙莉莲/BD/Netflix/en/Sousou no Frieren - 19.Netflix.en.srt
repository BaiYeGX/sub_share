1
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:07,173
We will now
begin the first-class mage exam.

2
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,844
You will battle in parties.
All 57 participants

3
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:15,848
will be put in parties of three
to take this exam.

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,354
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

5
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:59,660
See, you can do it
if you put your mind to it…

6
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,621
You think so?

7
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:05,541
Lawine is rough,

8
00:02:05,624 --> 00:02:07,877
but she's a good leader to me.

9
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,759
Tomorrow will be our first time
fighting a dragon.

10
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:18,763
Are you scared, Eisen? You're trembling.

11
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:22,892
-Yeah.
-I see. Well then…

12
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:26,562
-You're really scared?
-Yeah.

13
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:31,358
I see…

14
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,402
I'm scared too.

15
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:36,072
Where is this conversation going?

16
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:41,410
I was trying to raise everyone's morale
like other adventurers do.

17
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,037
But sorry…

18
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,538
I guess it didn't work.

19
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:48,167
No, thanks to you I'm less nervous now.

20
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,128
Himmel, just be yourself.

21
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:55,049
I'm sure each party of adventurers
handles things differently.

22
00:02:57,676 --> 00:02:59,178
I guess so.

23
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:07,812
I see. I guess each party
really does handle things differently.

24
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,322
We finally caught a Stille.

25
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:20,741
Now we can relax for the time being.

26
00:03:21,742 --> 00:03:23,577
How optimistic of you.

27
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:27,206
This is where the really hard part begins.

28
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,375
We must protect the Stille

29
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:32,461
from other parties who will
try to steal it from us.

30
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,631
Now it's time to fight each other.

31
00:03:41,053 --> 00:03:45,641
All right, let's summarize
our observations of the Stille.

32
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:47,601
First of all, just like Frieren said,

33
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,563
that bird flies at supersonic speed.

34
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:58,779
It's impossible to match that speed.

35
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,323
Plus, it's as tough as a dragon

36
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,285
so it won't budge
with ordinary offensive magic.

37
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:06,078
<i>Restraints don't work either.</i>

38
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,415
On top of that,
it's hypersensitive to mana.

39
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,544
It flies away even when you approach it
while suppressing your mana.

40
00:04:22,344 --> 00:04:24,847
But the biggest problem is that

41
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,391
because Stilles barely have any mana,

42
00:04:27,474 --> 00:04:29,643
we can't use mana detection.

43
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,980
Thanks to that,
we have no clue where they are

44
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:35,107
or how many there are.

45
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,234
In the end, we were only able to

46
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,778
spot them three times yesterday morning.

47
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:44,241
I think they're being cautious because
the candidates are searching for them.

48
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,494
Worst-case scenario,
they may never appear again.

49
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,955
But even if we do find one,

50
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,708
we have no idea how to catch it.

51
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:54,251
Don't worry about that part.

52
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:56,503
<i>Actually, last night,</i>

53
00:04:57,087 --> 00:05:01,634
I was testing out a spell
that might help in catching a Stille.

54
00:05:01,717 --> 00:05:03,761
Oh yeah, you were doing something.

55
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:07,389
-What kind of spell is it?
-I already showed you, Kanne.

56
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,518
A spell that captures a bird.

57
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,939
Back when there were a lot more mages

58
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:17,524
and magic was more common than now,

59
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,487
a clan that lived off of hunting
developed this folk magic.

60
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:25,199
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>
<i>you stopped it using magic.</i>

61
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,619
But wasn't that a monster and not a bird?

62
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:30,955
Well, it's folk magic.

63
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,500
It seems to capture anything
that looks like a bird.

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,004
It's a strong restraining spell,
so I think it'll work on a Stille too.

65
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:42,007
Why were you keeping that a secret?

66
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,386
If we had used that,
we could've caught one yesterday.

67
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,763
It's not that simple.

68
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:52,017
This spell's range is 50 centimeters.

69
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,395
You have to get that close for it to work.

70
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,064
Fifty centimeters?

71
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:59,400
How close have we gotten to it?

72
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,069
The closest was three meters.

73
00:06:02,152 --> 00:06:04,738
But it seemed like it already sensed us

74
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,157
when we were 20 meters away.

75
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,327
We're just one step away, I guess.

76
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,788
That's a very big step.

77
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:15,249
Let me ask, just in case.

78
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:18,836
The two of you can't stall the Stille
with your magic, right?

79
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:21,463
If I can freeze it, it may be possible.

80
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:25,009
But since it's sensitive to mana
and so tough, it's hard to freeze.

81
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:27,970
It'll probably get away
before I can stop it.

82
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,598
With my magic,
I can easily stall it as long as

83
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,267
there's a large amount of water.

84
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:39,148
But the magic I use
only manipulates water,

85
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:42,026
so I can't generate water itself.

86
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:46,363
<i>That means I can't use it unless</i>
<i>there is water around.</i>

87
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,907
<i>Mana doesn't transfer well</i>
<i>through bodies of water</i>

88
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,911
<i>so it'll be difficult unless</i>
<i>I infuse the water with mana beforehand.</i>

89
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,997
<i>Only if it's dispersed like rain,</i>

90
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,916
<i>can I manipulate</i>
<i>large quantities of water instantly.</i>

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,669
<i>But if I infuse the water with mana,</i>

92
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:03,922
<i>Stilles, who are sensitive to mana,</i>
<i>would never approach.</i>

93
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:07,176
Never approach?

94
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,803
I see, they won't approach, huh?

95
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:14,183
This plan may work.

96
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,955
I agree that it's not a bad idea,
but it's risky.

97
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,708
It'll turn all other parties against us.

98
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,587
But we probably won't be able to
catch one otherwise.

99
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,467
Are you scared, Lawine?

100
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:54,765
Ouch! They'll rip out!

101
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,729
Fine! Let's do it!

102
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:04,942
{\an8}4TH PARTY
LAND, SECOND-CLASS MAGE

103
00:08:05,025 --> 00:08:08,987
{\an8}For now, let's hide here
and make it through the end of the exam.

104
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:11,615
{\an8}What? How boring.

105
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:14,493
{\an8}If you're a mage,
you should fight with confidence.

106
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:17,871
{\an8}If you're a mage, you should also
avoid unnecessary conflicts.

107
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,878
First, we'll have to fill up on water.

108
00:08:26,046 --> 00:08:29,174
I believe there was a lake at the center.

109
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:36,473
I'm glad we were able to catch
a Stille early on.

110
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:39,268
As long as we hide until sundown,

111
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:41,186
we can pass the first stage of the exam.

112
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:47,192
-What's wrong?
-Apparently, things won't be that easy.

113
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:50,821
I thought this was a road,

114
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:52,448
but it's a dried up riverbed.

115
00:08:53,198 --> 00:08:55,826
And I saw a few others
that looked like this.

116
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:01,415
If I remember correctly, they've put up
a barrier around the exam location.

117
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,293
Yeah, that's common for these exams.

118
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,672
It's a powerful antimatter barrier
that won't let a speck of dust through.

119
00:09:08,755 --> 00:09:11,675
Does it also not let water through?

120
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,304
Looking at how dry it is,

121
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:18,056
the barrier must've been put up
more than a week ago.

122
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,851
Then most of the water

123
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:24,062
must have flowed into the lake
at the center of the basin.

124
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:27,065
We candidates, are living beings,

125
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,693
so we need water to function.

126
00:09:30,277 --> 00:09:31,320
But that doesn't mean

127
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,698
the candidates are
all gathered around the lake.

128
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:36,950
True,

129
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,453
we are able to carry our own water.

130
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:43,707
But the same doesn't apply to Stilles
who are also living beings.

131
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,042
I see.

132
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,711
So the people who realized this

133
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:51,131
are lying in wait
by the biggest source of water, the lake.

134
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,803
All right, give up on getting water.

135
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,056
That's going a little too far.

136
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,558
I'm already parched.

137
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,102
I'm sure we can find a little pond.

138
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,688
Is that sanitary?

139
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,565
Maybe if we boil it.

140
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:33,423
{\an8}8TH PARTY
SCHARF, THIRD-CLASS MAGE

141
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:36,927
{\an8}8TH PARTY
EHRE, SECOND-CLASS MAGE

142
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,517
{\an8}What a pain.

143
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,185
{\an8}I wanted to kill you with that shot.

144
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,063
I'm surprised you reacted in time.

145
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:53,944
Well, whatever.
Leave the cage with the Stille and go.

146
00:10:54,027 --> 00:10:55,696
What if we say "no"?

147
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:58,198
Then there's no use talking.

148
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:10,210
<i>The lake is over there.</i>

149
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,320
She froze the lake!

150
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:38,322
What in the world is she thinking?

151
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,948
This is not funny!

152
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:43,327
This mana belongs to
someone in the second party.

153
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,370
What are they thinking?

154
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,041
Do they plan to turn
all the other parties against them?

155
00:11:56,923 --> 00:12:00,552
Come on! Hurry up and melt it!

156
00:12:03,096 --> 00:12:05,223
Denken, what should we do?

157
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,684
{\an8}That's just a waste of time and energy.

158
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,602
{\an8}13TH PARTY
DENKEN, SECOND-CLASS MAGE

159
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,228
{\an8}There's no point in melting it.

160
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,355
{\an8}13TH PARTY
RICHTER, SECOND-CLASS MAGE

161
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:13,732
{\an8}With this much magic used on it,

162
00:12:13,815 --> 00:12:17,235
{\an8}no Stille will approach this lake anymore.

163
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,989
We will steal the Stille
from the second party.

164
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,241
Seeing how much of a ruckus they made,

165
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:27,120
they must have worked out
a plan to catch a Stille.

166
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,895
<i>Mistress Frieren,</i>
<i>what are you planning to do?</i>

167
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,364
Let's split up for now.

168
00:13:07,702 --> 00:13:10,330
Hurry up and melt the frozen lake!

169
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,666
How foolish.

170
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:16,461
If you use this much magic
to melt the ice,

171
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:20,132
this lake will really become useless.

172
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,802
No Stille will come near here anymore.

173
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,011
Let's go.

174
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,304
Yeah. That way!

175
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,807
Those who have realized that fact

176
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,309
are searching for other bodies of water.

177
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,645
<i>But their mana detection is so poor.</i>

178
00:13:33,728 --> 00:13:36,731
<i>They won't be able to</i>
<i>fend off dangers that lurk in the sky.</i>

179
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,816
<i>How amateur.</i>

180
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,319
The second party froze the lake!

181
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,363
Are they trying to ruin the exam?

182
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,616
"Ruin"? That's not it.

183
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,579
This is the second party's elaborate plan.

184
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:54,082
We can't do anything
until we figure out what that plan is.

185
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,109
The monsters got to them.

186
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,036
They're dead.

187
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,956
Let's go.

188
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,876
Old man, let's at least let them down.

189
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,338
I'm sure you notice, don't you?

190
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:43,256
They're circling up above.

191
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:46,760
It's not just one or two of them.

192
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:49,888
<i>They've put a spell on the dead bodies.</i>

193
00:14:49,971 --> 00:14:53,391
<i>If you try to let the bodies down,</i>
<i>they can detect that.</i>

194
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,101
<i>They're Geisels.</i>

195
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:59,022
<i>They use these hunting methods to lure in</i>
<i>their next prey.</i>

196
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,776
This party fell right into their trap

197
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,402
and was annihilated.

198
00:15:05,153 --> 00:15:06,404
It's not normal

199
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,699
to choose a place
with monsters like these for an exam.

200
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:13,119
It's as if they don't care
if the candidates die.

201
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:17,290
Oh right, it's your first time
taking the first-class exam.

202
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,251
The reason is quite simple.

203
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:21,920
People who die this easily

204
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:24,756
are not fit to be first-class mages.

205
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:27,133
The Continental Magic Association

206
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,761
is concerned about
the quality of first-class mages.

207
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:33,139
Some people are still fantasizing about

208
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:37,769
the strong, proud mages that were around
when we were fighting the Demon King.

209
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,564
Talk about being behind the times.

210
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,816
I'm surprised, Denken.

211
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,319
I thought you were one of those
who advocate that.

212
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,406
Quality doesn't matter
when it comes to mages.

213
00:15:49,489 --> 00:15:51,283
First-class mages

214
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:54,619
have to be a symbol of authority,
nothing more than that.

215
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,081
No matter how skilled you are as a mage,

216
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:01,418
you are powerless if you cannot
win over the hearts of people.

217
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:05,755
<i>I have seen my fair share of mages who are</i>

218
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,676
<i>far superior to me,</i>
<i>fall from power and suffer persecution.</i>

219
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,013
People fear immense power.

220
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:15,557
Authority based on fear is short-lived.

221
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,312
Plus, magic is nothing to be
proud about anyway.

222
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:21,771
I see.

223
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,441
So being as weak as you
is the perfect balance, huh?

224
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,652
Aren't you getting cocky, youngster.

225
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,031
I can win against you with my eyes closed.

226
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,441
We can't detect the second party at all.

227
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:09,569
They must be
concealing their mana and hiding.

228
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,739
This place too…

229
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,367
It's the same as all the other
bodies of water we've seen.

230
00:17:17,577 --> 00:17:21,122
It's not much,
but the water is infused with mana.

231
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,501
I don't detect anything.

232
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,588
-Can you?
-I can't either.

233
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,256
Did the second party do this?

234
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:34,386
Even the very person who infused it
may not be able to detect it.

235
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:36,429
That is how subtle it is.

236
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,890
But a Stille will be able to detect it.

237
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:42,394
They won't come near this water anymore.

238
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,980
What's the point in doing this?

239
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:48,900
I see! There must be a body of water
that's not infused with mana.

240
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:54,030
And the second party
will most definitely be near that.

241
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,074
How do we find it?

242
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:00,578
-I'm going to take a break.
-Denken…

243
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,373
The exam location is huge.

244
00:18:03,456 --> 00:18:07,669
There's no way to find mages who are
hiding to the best of their ability.

245
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:09,295
We'll wait.

246
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,674
They will let us know
their location anyway.

247
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:18,680
I've infused mana into all the ponds
and springs that I could find.

248
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:22,684
Although, there may be water bodies
that we don't know about.

249
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,439
Just being able to limit the water
that Stilles can use is enough.

250
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,776
Well then,
I'll wait here for a Stille to come.

251
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,956
Seriously? Who knew you could
make mana disappear completely.

252
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,666
It's not "completely."

253
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,878
If I move, a little bit of mana leaks out.

254
00:18:50,503 --> 00:18:53,339
-See?
-I can't even tell.

255
00:18:54,382 --> 00:18:55,842
We'll be on the lookout then.

256
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:02,140
-Don't get in the way.
-Shut up.

257
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:05,560
If only it was raining,
I could be more useful.

258
00:19:05,643 --> 00:19:08,313
Too bad the barrier
is repelling everything.

259
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,548
Frieren, did you do it?

260
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:20,552
It was worth turning
the other parties against us.

261
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,304
Now we can pass the first stage.

262
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,058
No…

263
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:29,060
Found them.

264
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,896
<i>As I thought, they used magic.</i>

265
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,190
<i>No matter how skilled of a mage you are,</i>

266
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,776
<i>there is no way to cover up this moment.</i>

267
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:40,822
Someone detected us. We should hurry and--

268
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,415
I guess it's too late to run away.

269
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,667
Jubelade.

270
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,802
Doragate.

271
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:05,763
<i>They're like cannonballs.</i>

272
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,893
<i>She stepped back again.</i>

273
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:19,903
<i>Her moves are polished and flawless,</i>

274
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:24,282
<i>but it's an outdated fighting style.</i>
<i>It's like fighting with my grandpa.</i>

275
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:27,619
Ordinary offensive magic
and defensive magic…

276
00:21:27,702 --> 00:21:30,288
You're only using basic magic, huh?

277
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:32,290
Are you trying to hide your trump card?

278
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:36,794
I was told not to use anything other than
basic magic in combat.

279
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,672
So that's your master's policy, huh?

280
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,090
Yes.

281
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:44,427
Apparently, that is more than enough
to fight mages of this era.

282
00:21:45,303 --> 00:21:46,346
Is that right?

283
00:21:55,021 --> 00:21:56,189
<i>There she goes again.</i>

284
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,734
<i>What is this strange sensation?</i>

285
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:03,446
<i>It feels as if I'm up against</i>
<i>a seasoned mage or something.</i>

286
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:07,367
I sympathize with you.
With that kind of fighting style,

287
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,828
you would've been dead already
if you were against Wirbel.

288
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,705
That wouldn't make sense.

289
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,084
Because you are the strongest one
out of all of them, aren't you?

290
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:30,306
Wirbel has been fighting
the remnants of the Demon King's army

291
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,475
as captain of the Northern Magic Corps.

292
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,353
His experience in combat
is on another level.

293
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:39,023
<i>His magic has</i>
<i>absolutely no class, is cowardly,</i>

294
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,359
<i>and is only meant to bring him victory.</i>

295
00:22:42,068 --> 00:22:44,362
That girl who is fighting Wirbel

296
00:22:45,071 --> 00:22:46,990
is probably going to get killed.

297
00:22:48,282 --> 00:22:49,450
Is that so.

298
00:24:19,957 --> 00:24:21,959
<i>-What kind of horror did you experience?</i>
<i>-Next time,I will cut off the head.</i>

299
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,795
<i>-I will take this one down.</i>
<i>-They're strong.</i>

300
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:25,880
<i>-Interesting. Why don't you try?</i>
<i>-What is this sound?</i>

301
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:27,423
<i>You old fart.</i>

302
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,884
<i>"Necessary Killing."</i>

303
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:30,843
