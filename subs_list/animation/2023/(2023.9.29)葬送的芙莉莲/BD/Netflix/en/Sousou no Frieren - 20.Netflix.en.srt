1
00:00:17,558 --> 00:00:18,851
<i>How scary.</i>

2
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:22,396
<i>This is most likely a spell</i>
<i>that slices through objects.</i>

3
00:00:24,273 --> 00:00:26,442
<i>The spell itself is a simple one,</i>

4
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,611
<i>but I can't see its trajectory.</i>

5
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:35,576
It's impossible to dodge all of them.
However…

6
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,455
What's wrong?
You're not going to come after me?

7
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:42,458
I may have lost control of myself a bit.

8
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,793
Yeah…

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,963
The range of your magic
is about five meters, isn't it?

10
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:51,717
That's correct.
So, what are you going to do about it?

11
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,719
Shall we go back to firing basic magic?

12
00:00:55,012 --> 00:00:58,099
No, there's no need for that.

13
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:01,352
<i>His magic has</i>
<i>absolutely no class, is cowardly,</i>

14
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:03,688
<i>and is only meant to bring him victory.</i>

15
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:06,065
<i>That girl who is fighting Wirbel</i>

16
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:07,858
<i>is probably going to get killed.</i>

17
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,195
Well then…

18
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:17,952
<i>A saturation attack?</i>

19
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,875
<i>How can she handle this much</i>
<i>offensive magic at once?</i>

20
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:30,423
What are you thinking,
relying on a brute-force attack?

21
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:31,841
You have absolutely no class!

22
00:01:35,928 --> 00:01:37,847
I can't keep up.

23
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,857
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

24
00:03:18,447 --> 00:03:19,990
Sorganeil.

25
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,669
I can't move my body.

26
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:34,922
<i>I can't control my mana either?</i>

27
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:37,508
<i>A powerful restraining spell, huh?</i>

28
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:42,429
<i>If he can use something like this,</i>
<i>why can't he catch a Stille himself?</i>

29
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,184
<i>Well, I guess it's useless</i>
<i>unless he can actually find a Stille.</i>

30
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:52,064
My magic can restrain
whoever is within my sight.

31
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:56,819
As long as I keep my eyes on you,
you won't be able to move.

32
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:59,071
In your current state,

33
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,657
I can kill you with ease.

34
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,077
<i>And it seems he was going easy on us.</i>

35
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,538
<i>If he really wanted to kill us,</i>

36
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:11,208
<i>he would have restrained us</i>
<i>during that surprise attack.</i>

37
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,335
This is your last chance.

38
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:18,507
Leave the Stille behind and go.

39
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:21,635
<i>Oh, how boring.</i>

40
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,388
<i>I was looking forward to</i>
<i>fighting him to the death.</i>

41
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:27,892
<i>In the end, all he wanted to do</i>
<i>was extort the Stille.</i>

42
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:31,604
Wait a second.

43
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:34,607
Why do you have to make that order?

44
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,360
You can just take the Stille
away from me while I can't move.

45
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:02,468
So it doesn't work unless
my entire body is within view, huh?

46
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:05,387
No wonder you don't use it
against multiple people.

47
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:09,600
-You aimed for my eyes, didn't you?
-It's logical, isn't it?

48
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:11,060
No,

49
00:05:11,143 --> 00:05:15,147
if I were you, I would've aimed for
the neck to kill my target.

50
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,608
Then the battle would be over.

51
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:20,110
You could have done that too.

52
00:05:21,445 --> 00:05:24,365
There were people who acted like you
on the battlefield too.

53
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:29,620
They were all perverts
who enjoyed killing.

54
00:05:32,414 --> 00:05:35,125
I'd better kill you here.

55
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:40,881
Have you ever killed women and children?

56
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,384
You think I haven't?

57
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:47,888
What kind of horror did you experience?

58
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,224
Are you trying to buy time?

59
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,770
Fine, I'll play along.

60
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,400
<i>The Northern Magic Corps is</i>

61
00:05:59,483 --> 00:06:02,111
<i>a group of mercenaries</i>
<i>specializing in fighting demons.</i>

62
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:05,280
<i>But in an emergency,</i>
<i>we also fight international warfare.</i>

63
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:13,789
<i>People are well aware</i>
<i>of their own weaknesses.</i>

64
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:18,210
<i>Forcing women and children</i>
<i>onto the battlefield is diabolical</i>

65
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:20,796
<i>but also a very common act.</i>

66
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,965
<i>It's not "horror."</i>

67
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,011
That's everyday life in the north.

68
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:29,138
Is that so?

69
00:06:30,514 --> 00:06:31,432
That's enough.

70
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:45,946
You're not going to kill me?

71
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:52,369
In my opinion,
the type of magic one specializes in

72
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:56,331
greatly reflects their life and character.

73
00:06:57,124 --> 00:07:00,502
This magic,
which restrains the target's movements,

74
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,213
makes it seem like you want to
delay their death.

75
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:06,467
I see…

76
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,595
So that's why you played along
with my tactic to buy time?

77
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:11,555
How surprising.

78
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:13,974
Your hands are stained with blood already,

79
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,852
but you still wish to be human, huh?

80
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:21,648
That's right.

81
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,777
This is the time I need
to find my resolve to kill.

82
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:26,945
But you know, little girl,

83
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:32,159
I may hesitate and waver,

84
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:35,120
but I've never failed a necessary killing.

85
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:40,125
Goodbye, little girl.

86
00:07:43,837 --> 00:07:46,006
Don't move, please.

87
00:07:51,678 --> 00:07:55,140
Are you serious? You took down Ehre?

88
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,893
<i>I didn't sense her presence at all.</i>

89
00:07:57,976 --> 00:08:01,939
I'm surprised. You're able to
make your mana disappear completely?

90
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:05,401
You must be the one who caught the Stille.

91
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:07,486
We were just lucky.

92
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:10,280
We happened to find the Stille's nest,

93
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:14,451
and she had learned the spell
that captures a bird from her master.

94
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:16,829
You can capture anything,

95
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:19,415
but it seems you are really unlucky.

96
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:22,167
Seriously. I'm out of luck.

97
00:08:23,001 --> 00:08:26,171
You were fighting Ehre, weren't you?
What did you do with her?

98
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,631
I killed her.

99
00:08:32,636 --> 00:08:35,347
The conditions to pass
the first stage of the exam were

100
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,934
to have a caged Stille in your possession
by sundown today

101
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:41,812
and to have all party members present.

102
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,483
We've lost.

103
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,068
I'll be leaving.

104
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,071
Weren't you going to kill me?

105
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,740
We are officially disqualified.

106
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,701
Killing you is unnecessary now.

107
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:57,202
Bye.

108
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:01,832
Feel free to aim for my back.

109
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,336
It will only turn an unnecessary killing
back into a necessary one.

110
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,465
-Mistress Übel.
-I know.

111
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,972
You're a good liar.

112
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,725
Let's go assist Master Land while we can.

113
00:09:20,517 --> 00:09:21,977
I'm sure he's fine.

114
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,606
Four-eyes seems to be quite the trickster.

115
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,121
The game's over.

116
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,249
That's amazing.

117
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:51,048
You controlled countless
steel flower petals with precision

118
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:52,508
and slipped through my defense.

119
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,136
But I bet it's self-taught.

120
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:01,141
Self-taught people
tend to neglect the basics.

121
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:05,187
Before I fight against
someone I don't know,

122
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,023
I always remember to observe first.

123
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,401
I know your weakness very well.

124
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,403
I'm pretty sure I'll win.

125
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,364
You're quite the chatterbox.

126
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:18,408
How do you plan to win without
using your dominant arm?

127
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:24,873
If you won't surrender,
I will cut your head off next.

128
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:29,127
Like I said,
I'm just observing before I fight.

129
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,506
I bet you're not good at mana detection.

130
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,392
Phantom magic?

131
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:46,770
I actually exist,
so it's more like my clone.

132
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,774
Since when--

133
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,153
From the beginning.

134
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,614
From the moment the first stage began.

135
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:00,951
I don't trust others.

136
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:06,248
"Killed her" my ass.

137
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,127
That bitch lied to me like it was nothing.

138
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,838
Hey, wake up, Ehre.

139
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:18,427
You ran out of mana? How lame.

140
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,262
Weren't you top of your class?

141
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:25,684
I was beaten by her sheer amount
of ordinary offensive magic.

142
00:11:26,226 --> 00:11:28,145
I couldn't keep up with it all.

143
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,274
You don't believe me, do you?

144
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,818
No, I do.

145
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:42,576
You're an idiot for fighting her head-on.

146
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,288
You should have been able to win.

147
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:53,378
<i>But if she can do this much</i>
<i>with just ordinary offensive magic,</i>

148
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,798
<i>that woman must be quite the monster.</i>

149
00:11:57,799 --> 00:12:00,969
Let's go. We'll meet up with Scharf.

150
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,764
Wait, I can't walk.

151
00:12:04,848 --> 00:12:06,516
Jeez…

152
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,689
Hey!

153
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:15,734
Don't transport me like I'm cargo.
Give me a piggyback ride!

154
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,991
Why do I have to do this?

155
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,285
Do you sense Scharf nearby?

156
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,746
He's on the other side of that thicket.

157
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,749
Hey, Scharf! Help me carry Ehre…

158
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:38,590
Wirbel, please give me a piggyback ride.

159
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:40,509
I'm all numb and can't move.

160
00:12:44,846 --> 00:12:48,266
Damn it! Why is this happening?

161
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,772
What is this sound?

162
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,732
It must be the sound of rain.

163
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,527
It started raining outside of the barrier.

164
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,613
It's like a representation
of my mental state.

165
00:13:01,696 --> 00:13:04,449
In two to three hours it'll be sundown

166
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,660
and the first stage will end.

167
00:13:07,202 --> 00:13:09,454
We have two members out of commission.

168
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,582
We can't steal
a Stille in this state anymore.

169
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,419
We've failed this exam for sure.

170
00:13:15,502 --> 00:13:19,923
But you're still going to help us?
You must be very kind.

171
00:13:20,006 --> 00:13:23,093
I wouldn't mind
abandoning you two right here.

172
00:13:23,176 --> 00:13:26,721
-Don't leave us.
-Stop crying. Act like a man!

173
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:32,936
Is that kindness
also the reason why you fight demons?

174
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,153
You saved my village too.

175
00:13:41,236 --> 00:13:42,446
Don't be stupid.

176
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:45,657
Why would I risk my life out of kindness?

177
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,452
Humans fight for their own desires.

178
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,663
I had an ulterior motive.

179
00:13:52,372 --> 00:13:54,958
In my hometown, I had a crush.

180
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,254
<i>It was exactly 29 years ago.</i>

181
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:02,757
<i>Demons were becoming more active</i>
<i>in the northern lands,</i>

182
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,844
<i>so she and her whole family</i>
<i>ran away to the central lands.</i>

183
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,724
I was a dumb little kid,
so I tried to act cool.

184
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:15,103
I'll kill every one of those darn demons.

185
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,856
So come back to this village when I do.

186
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:26,573
<i>I was about four or five years old.</i>

187
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,534
<i>I don't even remember her face or name.</i>

188
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:37,542
-What a fool.
-I know, I'm a fool.

189
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:46,927
I have to go back by sea again.

190
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:49,012
I get really seasick, you know.

191
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,390
Want me to refer you to my grandfather?

192
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,851
He's a first-class mage,
so you can go by land…

193
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,354
Hey, Wirbel.

194
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,898
-What's wrong?
-Look.

195
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,413
You've got to be kidding.
What was all that work for?

196
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,626
It took way too long
for my luck to turn around.

197
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:29,970
Frieren, that girl hasn't made any move.

198
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,974
<i>An elf, huh?</i>

199
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:36,977
<i>She must be a capable mage.</i>

200
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,479
<i>I'm sure Laufen's magic</i>

201
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:42,607
<i>won't work on her again,</i>
<i>if she sees it even once.</i>

202
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,610
<i>But once is more than enough.</i>

203
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,988
<i>This isn't a fight to the death.</i>

204
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,952
-She disappeared!
-Frieren, the Stille!

205
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,330
It was taken, huh?

206
00:16:03,336 --> 00:16:05,171
What interesting magic.

207
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,228
It's pleasant inside the barrier
even when it's raining.

208
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,607
You were the proctor
for the second stage, weren't you,

209
00:16:24,232 --> 00:16:25,233
Sense?

210
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:31,072
It appears you've let many promising
examinees die yet again, Genau.

211
00:16:32,407 --> 00:16:33,992
Don't make me laugh.

212
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:39,080
If they were promising,
they wouldn't have died this easily.

213
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:43,335
Plus, the value of first-class mages
makes it worth it.

214
00:16:44,377 --> 00:16:46,212
You should know that.

215
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,841
Still, it's mean-spirited of you

216
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:54,930
to choose a prey that can't be detected
by mana in an exam for mages.

217
00:16:55,847 --> 00:16:58,224
Whether you capture it or not
depends on luck.

218
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:02,479
Fighting over the bird is just a pretense
for a battle royale.

219
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:04,731
Luck is part of one's ability.

220
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:10,028
<i>Plus, some of them seem to have</i>
<i>captured a Stille without using luck.</i>

221
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:14,199
Sundown is in three hours.

222
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:17,577
The battle will get intense from here.

223
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,832
Who do you think will make it?

224
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,001
I'm sure a third of them will pass.

225
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:28,630
Denken will definitely be one of them.

226
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:32,634
His abilities are on a par with
that of a first-class mage.

227
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:36,429
Why would an old man
only interested in wealth and power

228
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,390
take this exam now?

229
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,184
Is he after the privilege?

230
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:42,394
Who knows?

231
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:44,771
<i>He is up in years already.</i>

232
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,899
<i>He must have his own reasons.</i>

233
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,736
Hey, the magic that
she just used right now

234
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,196
was Jilwer, right?

235
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,534
It's folk magic from
a mountain tribe in the southern lands.

236
00:17:58,118 --> 00:17:59,786
Yes, that's right.

237
00:17:59,869 --> 00:18:03,415
-Jilwer?
-Magic that lets you move at high speeds.

238
00:18:04,082 --> 00:18:07,919
In that case,
you two should have stayed hidden.

239
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,423
All she had to do was
run away with the Stille.

240
00:18:11,506 --> 00:18:14,467
Laufen is still inexperienced.

241
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,303
She left too many traces of her mana.

242
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:21,683
You would be able to
track her down easily, Frieren.

243
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,479
In fact, you must be
rather annoyed that we're holding you.

244
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,689
Yeah.

245
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,233
You know about me?

246
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:35,030
There isn't a single mage in my generation
who doesn't know your name.

247
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:38,241
It's my first time
seeing you in person, though.

248
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:40,118
But I knew the moment I saw you,

249
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:45,123
that you were the mage
of the party of heroes, Frieren.

250
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:48,960
-She's famous?
-She's a legendary mage.

251
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,671
I had an inkling that it was her.

252
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,132
Elves really don't age, do they?

253
00:18:54,215 --> 00:18:57,427
So, in the end, you're going to
challenge us head-on?

254
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,305
You were spying on us
the whole time, weren't you?

255
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,516
I expected you to use more dirty tricks.

256
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,019
Well, this is dirty enough.

257
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:09,606
While Denken stalls you,

258
00:19:09,689 --> 00:19:12,901
I will kill either one of those brats.

259
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,819
I see.

260
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,990
If we lose a party member
and fail to meet the requirements,

261
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,159
we will have no choice but to give up.

262
00:19:21,242 --> 00:19:23,745
Interesting. Why don't you try?

263
00:19:23,828 --> 00:19:27,290
-Lawine, he's strong.
-I know.

264
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,878
Stop it, Richter.

265
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:34,881
As long as we can stall them,
that's enough.

266
00:19:34,964 --> 00:19:36,049
We can win this.

267
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:43,056
Denken, I thought you would be
a more ruthless and cold person.

268
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:45,767
Aren't you an Imperial Mage?

269
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,020
I'm sure you've eliminated
more than enough political enemies.

270
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,489
I just don't think that becoming

271
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:02,325
a first-class mage is worth
killing someone over.

272
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,953
I can agree with you on that, at least.

273
00:20:05,036 --> 00:20:08,081
A first-class mage
is nothing more than a title.

274
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:10,208
It's not worth it in my opinion.

275
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,461
Unbelievable.

276
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:17,298
Don't tell me you don't know about
the privilege?

277
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,216
Privilege?

278
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:25,265
Half a century ago, the founder of
the Continental Magic Association

279
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:28,351
who reigns over all of mankind's mages,

280
00:20:28,434 --> 00:20:30,937
suddenly came into the limelight.

281
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,731
That is the Great Mage Serie.

282
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:39,112
<i>She is still pursuing mages like those</i>
<i>who were refined during the long war</i>

283
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,989
<i>against the Demon King's army.</i>

284
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:43,825
<i>That is why she has</i>

285
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:49,455
<i>promised a privilege to those who</i>
<i>rise to the rank of first-class mage.</i>

286
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:53,710
{\an8}<i>She will bestow upon them</i>
<i>one spell of their choice.</i>

287
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:58,882
<i>Serie is a living grimoire who knows</i>
<i>almost every spell that has existed</i>

288
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:00,216
<i>in the history of mankind.</i>

289
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:05,430
<i>She is the closest existence to</i>
<i>the Almighty Goddess.</i>

290
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:10,185
<i>You can attain an enormous fortune,</i>
<i>heal a serious illness,</i>

291
00:21:10,268 --> 00:21:13,229
<i>or even gain tremendous power.</i>

292
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,233
<i>Being bestowed</i>
<i>with whatever spell you desire</i>

293
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,695
<i>is any mage's dream come true.</i>

294
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:23,364
<i>People are very simple.</i>

295
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,658
<i>Because of that, first-class mages are now</i>

296
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:28,745
<i>a group of monsters</i>
<i>who make you doubt if they're human.</i>

297
00:21:28,828 --> 00:21:31,206
That is how valuable it is.

298
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:32,874
I see.

299
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:34,626
That's ridiculous.

300
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:43,885
Denken, people like you, who don't care
about the privilege, are the minority.

301
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,888
Let's begin.

302
00:21:46,971 --> 00:21:49,766
Denken, stall her for one minute.

303
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:52,393
That'll be enough time
for me to kill both of them.

304
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,646
Don't make me repeat myself, Richter.

305
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,106
They're just two brats.

306
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,901
You only have to
put them to sleep for three hours.

307
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:03,154
-Babysitting them should be easy.
-Denken…

308
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:09,994
I will take her down.

309
00:22:10,703 --> 00:22:14,123
-That should be enough.
-You old fart.

310
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:16,626
Bargland.

311
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,815
Young ones are just too hot-blooded.

312
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,709
<i>-How immature.</i>
-<i>A spell of your choice?</i>

313
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,461
<i>-But he has his guard down.</i>
<i>-Come on…</i>

314
00:24:23,544 --> 00:24:24,629
<i>-What a show.</i>
<i>-I know!</i>

315
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:25,546
<i>-It's Frieren.</i>
<i>-That old man.</i>

316
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,717
<i>In the world of magic, heaven and earth</i>
<i>can be turned upside down.</i>

317
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,760
