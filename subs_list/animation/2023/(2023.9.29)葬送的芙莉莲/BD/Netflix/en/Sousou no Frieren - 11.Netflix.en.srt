1
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:24,607
Mistress Frieren…

2
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:28,611
That took a while.

3
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:31,697
I see you defeated Aura.

4
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:51,342
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

5
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:25,686
Unbelievable…
Who'd have thought this was possible?

6
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,188
Let's go.

7
00:02:27,813 --> 00:02:30,107
Wait, there's no need to run.

8
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,527
Graf Granat said he'd pardon you.

9
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,199
It must've been a fierce battle

10
00:02:39,658 --> 00:02:41,702
but they are all mostly intact.

11
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,040
I appreciate it.

12
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:51,003
Thank you for showing honor
to the heroes of the northern lands.

13
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,842
Before, I used to make a bigger mess.

14
00:02:57,593 --> 00:02:59,178
But Himmel got mad at me.

15
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,057
Of course he would.
I don't blame him for getting mad.

16
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,308
I'd get mad too.

17
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,020
Master Himmel did a good job training you.

18
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:09,563
Don't call it training.

19
00:03:10,731 --> 00:03:13,067
But I guess you're right…

20
00:03:16,445 --> 00:03:18,572
That's a normal response.

21
00:03:19,281 --> 00:03:20,866
What do you mean?

22
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:23,160
Don't mind me.

23
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,914
Fern, Stark,

24
00:03:27,623 --> 00:03:29,667
good job defeating Lügner and Linie.

25
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,418
I'm proud of you.

26
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:38,425
It would've been better
if you weren't so beat up.

27
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:40,928
This is normal for a warrior.

28
00:03:41,011 --> 00:03:44,390
-What is "normal"?
-You're covered in wounds.

29
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:47,351
Give them a proper burial.

30
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:50,646
-I will escort them to town.
-Yes, sir.

31
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:51,814
Your Excellency…

32
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,983
What's wrong?

33
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,037
Frieren,

34
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,584
I've never wanted to thank someone
as much as I do today.

35
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,432
Frieren,

36
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,475
it is true

37
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,979
that I said I would do
whatever I can to reward you.

38
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,482
And you requested for

39
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,110
Great Mage Flamme's Grimoire
about defense barriers,

40
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,279
which has been passed down

41
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:42,990
in the Granat family for generations.

42
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,910
Are you sure this is what you want?

43
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,871
-This grimoire is…
-Fake.

44
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,418
That's right. It is nothing close
to the defense barrier spell

45
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:58,756
used on this town, which has been
passed down orally.

46
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:01,592
I am well aware of that, Your Excellency.

47
00:05:01,675 --> 00:05:03,302
This is just a hobby of mine.

48
00:05:04,094 --> 00:05:05,012
I see.

49
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:09,308
More importantly,
there's no need to speak so formally.

50
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:13,479
To you, I'm probably nothing but a baby.

51
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:16,732
On our departure to defeat the Demon King,

52
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:18,275
I learned my lesson.

53
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:22,154
Oh, I remember Master Heiter
talking about that.

54
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,449
In the royal capital, disrespecting
nobility is a capital offense.

55
00:05:26,116 --> 00:05:27,284
Himmel and Eisen

56
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:30,996
spoke informally to the king
and were almost executed.

57
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,501
How nostalgic.
I remember Himmel's face as he wailed.

58
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:39,380
Capital offense?
That must be an exaggeration.

59
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:42,049
One more thing, you brat.

60
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:45,511
Using informal speech with me
is a serious crime in this town.

61
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:49,807
Sorry, old man.
I'm going to break this fancy chair.

62
00:05:50,307 --> 00:05:53,852
Who knew the central lands
were so savage, Your Excellency?

63
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,817
Are you serious?!

64
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,737
-We've cut down the tree out back.
-Good work.

65
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,824
Anyway,

66
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:09,827
I just said that to give him
an excuse to run away.

67
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,707
This town doesn't have any law that will
imprison you for informal speech.

68
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,917
Don't worry. You can relax.

69
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:22,089
-Well, if that's the case.
-Good for you, Master Stark.

70
00:06:25,342 --> 00:06:26,719
He's passed out.

71
00:06:32,057 --> 00:06:36,353
We've told the townspeople
the news of Aura's defeat.

72
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,857
They all can't wait to show
the heroes their appreciation.

73
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,693
Please spend some time here.

74
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:54,663
He's floating!

75
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,127
Oh, it was nothing.

76
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:24,920
All the shopping is done.

77
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,965
Then let's go.

78
00:08:29,174 --> 00:08:31,510
You're departing already, Frieren?

79
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,387
Graf Granat.

80
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,724
I'll see you to the gate.

81
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:42,187
Frieren,

82
00:08:43,021 --> 00:08:44,815
I hear you are heading to Ende,

83
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:47,943
the northernmost point of the continent
where the Demon King's castle is.

84
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:50,654
However,

85
00:08:50,737 --> 00:08:54,199
the current state of affairs
in the Northern Plateau is quite bad.

86
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,952
So they're limiting travel.

87
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,580
Even adventurers are required

88
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:02,708
to be accompanied by a first-class mage.

89
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:06,670
Well then, it shouldn't be a problem
since we have Mistress Frieren.

90
00:09:06,753 --> 00:09:09,590
What is a "first-class mage"?

91
00:09:09,673 --> 00:09:12,176
Mistress Frieren, you don't know?

92
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:15,095
It's a certification for mages set by

93
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,014
the Continental Magic Association.

94
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:19,933
-Certification?
-I got mine when I left home.

95
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:21,560
In the Holy City.

96
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:23,604
{\an8}See?

97
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:26,064
It's a certification
for a third-class mage.

98
00:09:26,815 --> 00:09:29,526
Now that I think about it,
that sounds familiar.

99
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,571
Certifications look like this now, huh?

100
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:37,159
Mistress Frieren, don't tell me you are
an uncertified underground mage?

101
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,244
Don't say it
like I'm an underground doctor.

102
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,416
I mean, organizations that manage mages
are constantly changing.

103
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,668
I can't afford to get certified each time.

104
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,131
And I bet this Holy Emblem
isn't valid anymore, right?

105
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,010
What is that relic?

106
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:59,056
Even I know about
the Continental Magic Association.

107
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:01,934
They've been around
for at least half a century.

108
00:10:02,017 --> 00:10:03,644
That's very recent.

109
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,812
It's so troublesome

110
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,524
when they change
management systems so frequently.

111
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,860
Either way,
we can't get anywhere like this.

112
00:10:13,737 --> 00:10:15,864
I'm not that knowledgeable in this area,

113
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,866
but the northern lands should have

114
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,494
a place to take
the first-class mage exam, right?

115
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,248
The largest city of magic
in the northern lands,

116
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,667
Äußerst, is the location.

117
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,793
NORTHERN LANDS - CENTRAL LANDS

118
00:10:27,876 --> 00:10:30,212
<i>It's way past the Schwer Mountains.</i>

119
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,967
<i>You just have to go along the main road,</i>
<i>but it'll be a long trip.</i>

120
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:39,972
Frieren,

121
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:43,308
the Granat family
is forever indebted to you.

122
00:10:46,186 --> 00:10:47,396
Have a safe trip.

123
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,244
It's snowing.

124
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,329
It's almost winter.

125
00:11:06,081 --> 00:11:08,959
Winter in this region is harsh,
so be careful.

126
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,963
-If you take it lightly, you'll die.
-It's that dangerous?

127
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,465
You don't know?

128
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:19,970
In the war against the Demon King's army,
most of the people died because of

129
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:22,889
the winter in the northern lands.

130
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,316
You see? We're lost.

131
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,739
What should we do?

132
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,331
We're lost.

133
00:11:47,414 --> 00:11:48,248
28 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO
DECKE REGION IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

134
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,209
We're lost and we haven't even entered
the Schwer Mountains.

135
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:52,836
This isn't even funny.

136
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,591
Master Stark! Wake up!
You'll die if you fall asleep.

137
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,847
Was the jumbo berry special
always this small…?

138
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,223
How would I know?

139
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:07,768
What should we do?

140
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,647
The wind is so strong, we can't
suspend him in the air with magic.

141
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,233
He'll get blown away somewhere.

142
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:18,987
I guess we have to carry him.

143
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:26,912
He's heavy.

144
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,248
Why is he so heavy?

145
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,085
It smells good…

146
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:35,879
-Can I leave him here?
-Bear with him.

147
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,049
There's a shelter
at the foot of the mountain.

148
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:42,594
That information is from
80 years ago, right?

149
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,638
Are we going to be okay?

150
00:12:52,145 --> 00:12:53,146
Thank goodness.

151
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,817
It seems they take care of it regularly.

152
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:04,366
There seems to be someone in there.

153
00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:06,076
Did someone beat us to it?

154
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,537
Let's just go inside.

155
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,789
We'll freeze to death at this rate.

156
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,880
This is great! I'm getting warm!

157
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,514
Excuse me.

158
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,437
Mistress Frieren, this place is no good.

159
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,646
Let's go somewhere else.

160
00:13:34,729 --> 00:13:38,608
-What? Why?
-Because there is a pervert in there.

161
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:41,653
Who are you calling a pervert?

162
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:45,407
Let's go, Mistress Frieren.

163
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,785
Wait. Are you an elf?

164
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:58,170
It's been about 300 years
since I last saw another elf.

165
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,923
I thought elves had already gone extinct.

166
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,550
Me too.

167
00:14:04,342 --> 00:14:06,553
Thank you for the fire, young lady.

168
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:08,180
You're welcome.

169
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,683
I'm lucky to have come across mages.

170
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:15,061
It must be thanks to the Goddess.

171
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,856
I crossed the Schwer Mountains

172
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,067
but my fire died out with this blizzard.

173
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:25,030
So I was preserving my life
by doing squats in this freezing cabin.

174
00:14:25,655 --> 00:14:26,573
I see.

175
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,075
I still don't get it.

176
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:31,828
I'm Kraft, a monk.

177
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,789
I'm Frieren, a mage.

178
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,458
I'm Fern, also a mage.

179
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,586
This is Master Stark, a warrior.

180
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:44,591
So you're on a journey
to Aureole, or heaven, huh?

181
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,803
It's good to have strong faith.

182
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,222
I don't completely believe it though.

183
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:51,932
Mistress Frieren.

184
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:54,684
Master Stark's temperature is…

185
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,360
<i>It's warm and relaxing.</i>

186
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,282
<i>And look at that huge jumbo berry special.</i>

187
00:15:10,116 --> 00:15:11,076
<i>What…</i>

188
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:14,162
<i>happened to me?</i>

189
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:17,707
<i>I remember we were in a blizzard…</i>

190
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:36,476
Who is this old man?!

191
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,730
How noisy.

192
00:15:41,356 --> 00:15:44,943
I was kind enough
to warm you up with my body heat.

193
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:48,405
-How rude of you.
-Body heat?

194
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:53,118
You've got a nice body, old man.

195
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,496
-Master Stark.
-I don't mean it like that.

196
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:00,500
His body is so well built.

197
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,670
I bet you're tremendously strong.

198
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:05,881
What's your name, old man?

199
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,758
I'm Kraft, a monk.

200
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:11,094
I've never heard of you.

201
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,472
But I'm sure you're a famous monk.

202
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:19,853
Stark, you stay here and rest.

203
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,189
You two, can you help me carry the food?

204
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:26,484
My wagon and cargo are nearby.

205
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,865
I'm really glad I met you all.

206
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,201
We should be able to do something
with this frozen food.

207
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,245
Feel free to use it all.

208
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:39,915
This should be more than enough.

209
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,002
Crossing over the Schwer Mountains now
would be suicidal.

210
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,963
I guess we'll kill time here.

211
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,258
By the way, Frieren,

212
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,678
do you know about me?

213
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,805
-Not at all.
-I thought so.

214
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:59,017
I don't know a thing about you either.

215
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:02,187
She was a mage in the party of heroes.

216
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:04,189
And before that?

217
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:06,858
What are you trying to say?

218
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,362
I'm just saying, we're elves.

219
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,413
It's almost been half a year.

220
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,666
Thanks to you all,

221
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:07,419
I survived the long winter
in the northern lands.

222
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,296
Here.

223
00:18:13,174 --> 00:18:15,427
Can you give it to Fern?

224
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:18,179
She's a good girl with strong faith.

225
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:21,099
Probably because a priest raised her.

226
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:24,602
She hasn't lost her appreciation
for the Goddess.

227
00:18:25,645 --> 00:18:28,273
Kraft, why do you believe in the Goddess?

228
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,652
Frieren, you don't believe in it, huh?

229
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:36,990
Aside from the mythical times,
the Goddess of Creation

230
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,076
has never actually shown herself

231
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,038
even once in the long history
of this world.

232
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:45,165
You must be young.

233
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,834
I used to think that way too.

234
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,422
But now, I believe in the Goddess
from the bottom of my heart.

235
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,926
More like, I really need her to be real.

236
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:00,472
Everyone who knew about all of

237
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:04,267
the deeds I achieved
and justice I upheld have died.

238
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:06,853
<i>That's why</i>

239
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:10,106
<i>I want the Goddess to commend me</i>
<i>when I die and go to heaven.</i>

240
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,693
<i>"Well done, Kraft.</i>

241
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,405
<i>You lived a wonderful life,"</i>

242
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:19,240
<i>she'll say.</i>

243
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:23,369
You understand, don't you?

244
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,623
Having nobody to remember

245
00:19:26,706 --> 00:19:29,250
the testaments to your existence

246
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,543
is just too cruel.

247
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:32,837
We have

248
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,091
lived a long time up until now.

249
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:42,680
Kraft, that is just our wishful thinking.

250
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:44,974
Yeah.

251
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:50,063
You think that way about heaven too?

252
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,737
Well, whatever.

253
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:01,616
Tell me about yourself.
And I'll tell you about myself.

254
00:20:02,325 --> 00:20:06,121
If you don't believe in the Goddess,
then I will commend you

255
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:08,414
in her place.

256
00:20:12,627 --> 00:20:14,838
-Is it surprising?
-Yeah.

257
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:19,884
Who would've thought that you would fund
the reconstruction of this orphanage.

258
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:23,763
You're so honest.

259
00:20:25,056 --> 00:20:27,267
I was also an orphan, after all.

260
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,647
I'm sure the Goddess

261
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,401
will commend me
for being virtuous and honorable.

262
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,697
What is this Corrupt Priest
going off about with a drink in his hand?

263
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,658
Frieren…

264
00:20:44,492 --> 00:20:47,412
Do you have someone who commends you?

265
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:49,914
Why all of a sudden?

266
00:20:50,665 --> 00:20:54,127
You don't seem to believe in the Goddess.

267
00:20:55,211 --> 00:20:59,340
So if you tell me about yourself,
I will commend you instead.

268
00:21:00,508 --> 00:21:02,510
I've just been living without purpose.

269
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,680
I've done nothing worthy of commendation.

270
00:21:06,347 --> 00:21:08,683
Even though you're constantly
controlling your mana?

271
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:15,440
To me, that seems like the result of
painstaking effort.

272
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:19,068
It's as if you've devoted your life to it.

273
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,322
You noticed?

274
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:25,450
How many years do you think
we've been traveling together?

275
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:28,328
It's not an interesting story.

276
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:33,458
I don't mind. Plus,
I want to know for future reference.

277
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,211
-Why?
-There's a possibility.

278
00:21:36,294 --> 00:21:39,464
That my child will become a mage.

279
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:44,010
Don't priests stay single
their whole lives?

280
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:54,646
Why is everyone who serves
the Goddess so weird?

281
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:57,690
I'll pass.

282
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,235
I already had someone commend me.

283
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,321
I see.

284
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,366
That seems like
a nice friendship, Frieren.

285
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,034
You should treasure it.

286
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,871
No, that person is already…

287
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,379
He's in heaven now.

288
00:22:20,171 --> 00:22:22,507
Then I will meet him one day.

289
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:24,759
Yeah.

290
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:28,888
I'm going this way.

291
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:32,809
Frieren, I don't think this is
the last time we'll meet.

292
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,770
See you in a few hundred years.

293
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,777
Take care, old man! It was fun!

294
00:22:43,861 --> 00:22:47,115
Thank you for the pendant!

295
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:21,209
<i>A clean white cape.</i>

296
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:22,835
<i>The village protecting the Hero's Blade.</i>

297
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,712
<i>It's a gift to reward</i>

298
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,631
<i>a warrior who has worked hard.</i>

299
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:28,216
