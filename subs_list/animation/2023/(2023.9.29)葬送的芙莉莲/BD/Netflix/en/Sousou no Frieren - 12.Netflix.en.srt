ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

2
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,470
29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

3
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,848
THE SCHWER MOUNTAINS IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

4
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,942
Mistress Frieren is about to fall asleep.

5
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:03,080
-She fell asleep.
-Oh well. I'll carry her on my back.

6
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,499
But you have your axe.

7
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:09,628
But my hands are free.

8
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,183
-I'll carry her on my back.
-Why?

9
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,976
Just because.

10
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:38,115
In the end,
the king only gave us ten copper coins.

11
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,118
-What a cheapskate.
-It can't be helped.

12
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,579
Up until now, many heroes have departed

13
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:46,540
and failed to defeat the Demon King.

14
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,211
Well, earning our own
travel expenses by completing

15
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:52,671
subjugation quests isn't so bad.

16
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,593
-It makes it more like an adventure.
-You're right.

17
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,096
Hey, that sword is the Hero's Blade.

18
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,598
It's a replica.

19
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:07,853
I once saved a peddler who came to
my village from a monster

20
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,524
and he gave this to me saying,
"To the hero of the future."

21
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:14,026
He was just playing.

22
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:17,154
-Is that why you became a hero?
-No.

23
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:21,325
There was an annoying kid named Heiter
in the orphanage.

24
00:03:21,408 --> 00:03:23,118
And he told me,

25
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:26,622
"Since you only have a fake sword,
you can only become a fake hero."

26
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:30,042
"Then I'll become a real hero
and show you."

27
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:32,044
That's what I thought.

28
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,134
One day, I will get a hold of
the real Hero's Blade

29
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:40,052
and defeat the Demon King.

30
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,056
But time sure is merciless.

31
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,017
Heiter, the one who was running his mouth,

32
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,104
is now a fake priest
who does nothing but drink.

33
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:51,605
I'm a real priest.

34
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,337
-It was just a dream…
-Mistress Frieren.

35
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,964
You're finally awake.

36
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:20,426
This scenery is like déjà vu.

37
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:25,014
-I must still be dreaming.
-Wouldn't that be nice.

38
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:27,600
I took the mountain's weather too lightly.

39
00:04:27,683 --> 00:04:29,351
Keep going north.

40
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,687
The village
we're headed to should be there.

41
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:32,730
Okay.

42
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,400
Mistress Frieren,
can you walk on your own?

43
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,987
-No.
-I see.

44
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,865
You smell good.

45
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:45,367
Jeez…

46
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,329
You must be tired
from carrying her the whole time.

47
00:04:48,412 --> 00:04:49,997
Fern, I'll take over.

48
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:01,592
Pervert…

49
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:06,180
Why?

50
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:11,352
The blizzard is dying down now.

51
00:05:11,435 --> 00:05:13,270
I was about to freeze to death.

52
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,070
A village actually exists
this deep in the mountains?

53
00:05:23,697 --> 00:05:26,533
We were waiting for you, Mistress Frieren.

54
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:30,913
You're the current village chief?
How young…

55
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:35,042
Yes, I am the 49th village chief.
It's hereditary.

56
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:38,462
Welcome to the Village of the Sword.

57
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,925
There was a destroyed cabin
outside the village.

58
00:05:43,008 --> 00:05:46,011
We used to use that as a hunting cabin.

59
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:49,848
-The Lord of the mountains did that.
-Lord?

60
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,809
Was there such a thing here?

61
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:54,853
So this is the Village of the Sword?

62
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,189
You know about it, Master Stark?

63
00:05:57,898 --> 00:06:00,109
It's the village that protected
the Hero's Blade.

64
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:03,737
<i>In the sanctuary near the village,</i>

65
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,574
<i>there was the Hero's Blade, which was said</i>
<i>to be bestowed by the Goddess.</i>

66
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,535
<i>All sorts of heroes</i>

67
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:13,580
<i>tried to pull it out throughout history,</i>
<i>but it never budged.</i>

68
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,166
<i>That was until 80 years ago.</i>

69
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,588
There was a legend regarding that…

70
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,758
The only one who can
pull out the Hero's Blade

71
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,929
is the hero destined to stop the great
calamity that will destroy the world.

72
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:29,847
That's it.

73
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,892
So Master Himmel is the one
who pulled out the sword?

74
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,227
That's right.

75
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,605
It's a pretty famous story.
You've never heard of it?

76
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:41,859
No, Master Heiter never told me.

77
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,988
Here it is.

78
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:49,116
So warm…

79
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:52,995
This is unacceptable, Mistress Frieren.

80
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:56,707
You promised to return in half a century.

81
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,377
Normally, I'm mild-tempered,
but I am mad about this.

82
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:04,631
Those were the last words of my grandma,
the chief two generations before me.

83
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:09,678
I said it'll be fine for another 80 years.

84
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:13,432
The people of this village who have
been protecting the Hero's Blade

85
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:15,601
should be able to protect themselves.

86
00:07:15,684 --> 00:07:17,936
That may be true.

87
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,647
But we need you to do your job too.

88
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,693
-What do you mean by "your job"?
-Getting rid of monsters.

89
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:28,280
Monsters regularly show up
around this village.

90
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:32,868
Recently, the Lord of the mountains
has been acting up too.

91
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:36,497
I guess we'll start tomorrow.

92
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,541
I'd rather get this out of the way.

93
00:07:56,767 --> 00:08:00,145
There are so many monsters
so close to the village.

94
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,522
Why didn't you hire

95
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:05,401
other adventurers
if your situation was this bad?

96
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,028
We would have loved to but…

97
00:08:08,612 --> 00:08:10,489
Himmel is a hero, after all.

98
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:14,535
There are seriously so many monsters.

99
00:08:15,869 --> 00:08:17,913
They're assembling by that cave.

100
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,560
Frieren! This is--

101
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,444
It's the Lord.

102
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:55,617
I see. No wonder I didn't know about you.

103
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,952
You're a newcomer.

104
00:08:57,744 --> 00:08:59,705
You think you're a lord
after just 80 years?

105
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,418
Stark, you can still move, right?

106
00:09:11,675 --> 00:09:13,427
You sure know how to use people!

107
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,226
Good job.

108
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,362
Now my job is done.

109
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,078
Frieren, care to explain?

110
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,624
That's the Hero's Blade.

111
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:47,961
This is what attracts the monsters here.

112
00:09:48,712 --> 00:09:51,632
Monsters can't get through
the sanctuary's strong barrier,

113
00:09:51,715 --> 00:09:54,718
but they can't resist their urge
to destroy that.

114
00:09:55,427 --> 00:09:58,055
That's how scared they are
of the Hero's Blade.

115
00:09:58,138 --> 00:09:59,848
That's not what I'm talking about.

116
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:01,934
Yeah…

117
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:09,983
Himmel wasn't able to pull out this sword.

118
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:15,113
This time's hero
wasn't the real one either, huh?

119
00:10:17,699 --> 00:10:18,909
Himmel…

120
00:10:19,868 --> 00:10:22,746
What's wrong with a fake hero?

121
00:10:24,164 --> 00:10:27,876
I will defeat the Demon King
and restore this world's peace.

122
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:34,258
Then being "real" or "fake"
will not matter anymore.

123
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:40,347
And Himmel accomplished just that.

124
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:43,225
He showed that he could save the world
without that sword.

125
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,644
He's a real hero.

126
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,439
Then why is that fact being hidden?

127
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:53,277
That was done by the people
who want to idolize Himmel.

128
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:56,947
Unappealing stories like how he couldn't

129
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,783
pull out the Hero's Blade
are unnecessary for a hero.

130
00:11:01,326 --> 00:11:03,787
Heroes are always

131
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,540
overly romanticized by future generations.

132
00:11:10,627 --> 00:11:14,715
And in time,
the truth becomes completely obscured.

133
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:35,068
I knew you'd come through for us,
Mistress Frieren.

134
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,361
Thanks a bunch.

135
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:39,072
That's also my grandma's last words.

136
00:11:39,656 --> 00:11:42,200
What kind of last words
did your grandma leave?

137
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:45,329
Well then,
see you in another half century.

138
00:11:47,622 --> 00:11:50,208
Next time, don't be late.

139
00:11:52,961 --> 00:11:56,006
29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

140
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:58,884
APPETIT REGION IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

141
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:03,138
Once we drop off our things at the inn,
everyone's free until nighttime.

142
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:06,141
I haven't seen a town in so long.
I can finally relax.

143
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:09,394
What are you going to do?

144
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:12,356
Do you want to shop around together?

145
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:16,234
I'm good. I'll relax here
and read my grimoires.

146
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,029
Really? Then I'll go by myself.

147
00:12:19,654 --> 00:12:20,655
Oh, that reminds me…

148
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:24,493
Today is Stark's 18th birthday.

149
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:30,290
Why don't you tell me
these things beforehand?

150
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,043
I don't have anything ready.

151
00:12:33,126 --> 00:12:35,003
Just buy something in the town.

152
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:39,508
I don't know what Master Stark wants.

153
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:43,470
You're so unprepared, Fern.

154
00:12:43,553 --> 00:12:45,472
It's your fault, you know.

155
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,475
By the way,

156
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,311
what are you planning to give to him?

157
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,654
It's special.

158
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,411
A potion that only melts clothes.

159
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,330
When it comes to men,

160
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:12,833
they're happy
just getting something like this.

161
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,543
That's what Master told me.

162
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:23,468
What? You're interested in it too?

163
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,684
When you bought this obscene potion

164
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,103
did I not tell you to return it?

165
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,356
Forget about you.

166
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:41,319
This potion was valuable, you know…

167
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:44,906
What should I give him?

168
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,217
I forgot I had this.

169
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,389
<i>I have no choice</i>
<i>but to get information from him directly.</i>

170
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:11,725
<i>Although it'd be very obvious…</i>

171
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,729
Master Stark.

172
00:14:20,942 --> 00:14:22,444
He went out?

173
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:28,492
A warrior carrying an axe on his back?

174
00:14:29,075 --> 00:14:31,661
He helped me push this cart.

175
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,498
I believe he went toward the plaza.

176
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,127
He was just playing with us.

177
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,090
He helped him down from the tree.

178
00:14:45,675 --> 00:14:48,595
He stopped a cow who was out of control.

179
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,139
<i>He's helped many people.</i>

180
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,936
<i>That was very rude of Mistress Frieren.</i>

181
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:00,232
<i>There's no way Master Stark would</i>
<i>be happy getting such a perverted potion.</i>

182
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,125
Master Stark…

183
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:23,338
That cloud looks like boobs.

184
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,758
<i>He is a pervert.</i>

185
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,637
Are you serious? That one looks like poop!

186
00:15:32,722 --> 00:15:35,684
<i>No, he's just childish.</i>

187
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:40,105
-I've got to tell Fern later.
<i>-How am I supposed to react to that?</i>

188
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,403
Master Stark.

189
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:49,865
Fern, great timing!

190
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:51,700
That cloud…

191
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,746
Sorry, never mind.

192
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,544
-Um…
-Want to take a walk?

193
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:03,503
Yes.

194
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,009
Hey, why are you mad? Did I do something?

195
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,513
<i>How should I bring it up?</i>

196
00:16:14,764 --> 00:16:17,017
I'll apologize.

197
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,644
<i>No matter how I do it, it'll be obvious.</i>

198
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,521
<i>Might as well ask him straight out.</i>

199
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:27,360
Master Stark, is there anything you want?

200
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,862
Why?

201
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,365
Because today is your birthday.

202
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:36,119
Is it? What does that have to do
with what I want?

203
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:41,124
It's for your birthday present.

204
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:43,251
What? You're giving me something?

205
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:47,756
Never mind. You're being annoying
so I won't give you anything.

206
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,761
No, I wasn't trying to be
funny or anything.

207
00:16:53,386 --> 00:16:57,057
I've never gotten any presents
on my birthday before.

208
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,149
I never received anything from
my late family members or my master.

209
00:17:06,232 --> 00:17:08,026
So I thought that's how it was.

210
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,695
Not even your family?

211
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:14,574
-Was that your culture?
-No…

212
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,994
They probably just didn't care about me.

213
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,831
My hometown was a village of warriors.

214
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,584
Weak people didn't belong.

215
00:17:26,002 --> 00:17:28,046
You let a mere monster do this to you?

216
00:17:29,005 --> 00:17:31,967
Try to be like Stoltz.
Not only is he unharmed,

217
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,636
but he also doesn't have a speck
of blood or dirt on him.

218
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,808
A spotless white cloak is the sign

219
00:17:39,891 --> 00:17:42,143
of this village's strongest warrior.

220
00:17:42,727 --> 00:17:44,938
Stoltz, you are
this village's pride and joy.

221
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,439
Of course, Dad.

222
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:53,863
Stark, on the other hand,
is such a failure.

223
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,741
Despite how much he trains every day,

224
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,619
he hasn't been able to fight
a monster even once.

225
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,792
It's starting to rain. Let's go.

226
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:08,795
I'll go train my good-for-nothing brother.

227
00:18:08,878 --> 00:18:10,880
Don't bully him too much.

228
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,425
I'm heading back.
I don't want to waste my time.

229
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,430
Stark.

230
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:24,436
Brother…

231
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:29,190
I'm sorry…

232
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,318
Good concentration.

233
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,364
I bet you'll become strong.

234
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,700
But your stance can use some work.

235
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:45,749
Actually, my older brother
was the only one who was different.

236
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:47,751
But…

237
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,678
When my hometown was attacked by demons,

238
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,723
I still abandoned him and ran away.

239
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:05,518
No wonder my family
never celebrated my birthday.

240
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:08,271
I'm a failure who can only run away.

241
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,735
If it were Himmel,
he wouldn't have run away.

242
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,407
Master Stark,

243
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:22,285
let's go pick out your present.

244
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,122
The past doesn't matter.

245
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,209
Stark, the warrior
whom I've seen up until now,

246
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:31,377
has never run away even once.

247
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:34,672
I might run away some day.

248
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:37,175
We won't let you get away.

249
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,596
-But I…
-If you don't come, I'll choose myself.

250
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,767
All right, fine.

251
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,691
-Okay, I choose this.
-No, that's too expensive.

252
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:54,818
Yes ma'am.

253
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,578
Welcome back. What took you so long?

254
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:10,542
Mistress Frieren, what is up with these
ridiculously huge Hamburg steaks?

255
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:14,212
What are you saying? A birthday
isn't a birthday without these.

256
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:17,715
Master never gave me a present,

257
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,468
but he always made me
a birthday Hamburg steak.

258
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,679
What is this about?

259
00:20:22,762 --> 00:20:26,724
-Stark, Eisen never told you?
-About what?

260
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,311
Warriors can be so difficult.

261
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,730
You're in no position to say that.

262
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:36,693
Yeah, I'm also difficult,
so I know what it's like.

263
00:20:36,776 --> 00:20:38,153
We're stupid, aren't we?

264
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,322
We should know that we have to
put our feelings into words.

265
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:43,491
This is…

266
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:49,080
Why do you make a ridiculously huge

267
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,667
Hamburg steak whenever it's
someone's birthday?

268
00:20:53,251 --> 00:20:56,045
This is a custom from the region I'm from.

269
00:20:56,129 --> 00:21:00,550
It's a gift you give to reward a warrior
who has worked very hard.

270
00:21:01,342 --> 00:21:04,345
Think of it as a birthday present from me.

271
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:07,932
But Eisen, we're not warriors.

272
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,144
Anyone who has worked hard is a warrior.

273
00:21:11,686 --> 00:21:14,439
-Really?
-Who knows?

274
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:17,609
A warrior who has worked very hard?

275
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,445
Brother, what are you making?

276
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,407
Hamburg steak.
It's your birthday, isn't it?

277
00:21:25,491 --> 00:21:27,577
Don't tell Dad or anyone.

278
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:35,960
Run away, Stark.

279
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,215
You must live.

280
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:12,247
Eisen gave me the recipe.

281
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,166
How is it? Does it taste good?

282
00:22:23,341 --> 00:22:24,258
Yeah.

283
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,139
Also, this…

284
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,058
There's still a little left.

285
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:35,019
Don't make me pour it on your head again.

286
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,854
Huh? What's that?

287
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,774
It has nothing to do with you.

288
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:43,069
-It's a valuable potion.
-What kind?

289
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:45,738
-Pervert.
-Huh? Why?

290
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,992
-Pervert.
-Why are you calling me that?

291
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,251
<i>-Himmel!</i>
<i>-I got a nosebleed.</i>

292
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,961
-<i>Alcohol is the best medicine.</i>
<i>-What about it?</i>

293
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,131
-<i>Adults use dirty tricks.</i>
<i>-I like older women.</i>

294
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,884
<i>"Aversion to One's Own Kind."</i>

295
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:30,927
