1
00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:02,668
<i>Frieren,</i>

2
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:07,089
<i>find Aureole and talk to Himmel.</i>

3
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:11,093
In the northernmost point
of the continent,

4
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:15,431
<i>I reached Aureole,</i>
<i>the land where souls rest,</i>

5
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:19,769
<i>a place which the people</i>
<i>of this world call heaven.</i>

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:23,606
<i>There were many souls gathered there</i>

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,276
<i>and I talked to my former comrades.</i>

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,989
Sorry,

9
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:34,742
it will be a long journey.

10
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:37,954
It took us ten years.

11
00:00:40,122 --> 00:00:41,207
I see…

12
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,087
It's the same journey all of you took
to the Demon King's castle.

13
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,391
That's right.

14
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,352
It was a mere ten-year adventure.

15
00:01:03,562 --> 00:01:05,356
"One-hundredth," huh?

16
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:10,861
Frieren, you're not staying
in the royal capital?

17
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,155
I'll continue traveling.

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,367
-On your own?
-It's easier that way.

19
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,286
You're not going to take an apprentice?

20
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,123
It's better to have someone
to talk to when traveling.

21
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,875
It's a waste of time.

22
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,628
Even if I teach them things,
they die right away.

23
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:34,510
Frieren, that's not what
interacting with people is about.

24
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,931
It is. My adventures with all of you

25
00:01:39,014 --> 00:01:42,268
don't even make up
one-hundredth of my life.

26
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,730
I vaguely remember
saying something like that.

27
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,941
Isn't it funny?

28
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:50,568
What?

29
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:53,571
That one-hundredth

30
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:56,198
changed you.

31
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,420
All right, see you.

32
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,964
Yeah, see you.

33
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,558
For me, it's half of my life.

34
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:26,479
That's how much time I've spent with you.

35
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,484
It'll just keep getting longer
from here on.

36
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:37,448
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

37
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,081
Now listen, Fern.

38
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,960
From now on, listen to what Frieren says

39
00:04:13,043 --> 00:04:15,129
and be a good girl.

40
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,089
Or else…

41
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,592
Or else?

42
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:22,970
I'll become a ghost and haunt you.

43
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:29,476
Master Heiter, so if I'm a bad girl,

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,437
does that mean I get to see you again?

45
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:39,069
You've become so devious.

46
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,821
Who did you take after?

47
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:43,908
I take that back.

48
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,912
If you are a good girl,

49
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:52,374
maybe I will
come to haunt you just a little.

50
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:59,673
Apparently, we're almost at the village.

51
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:03,427
I see.

52
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,723
-What?
-Nothing.

53
00:05:11,685 --> 00:05:14,730
28 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

54
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:17,191
WILLE REGION IN THE CENTRAL LANDS

55
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:29,245
You want to cross the mountain pass,
don't you?

56
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,789
I advise you not to.

57
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:35,209
Many people have gone missing already.

58
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:36,752
Is there a monster?

59
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:40,297
People say they were taken away by ghosts.

60
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,341
There are even eyewitnesses.

61
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:44,009
I wonder if they're the undead.

62
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,637
Do you know what those ghosts looked like?

63
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,722
I don't know that much.

64
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,642
If you're curious,
why don't you ask the eyewitnesses?

65
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,612
If you summarize it up,

66
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,242
<i>people have witnessed</i>
<i>ghosts of their family and friends</i>

67
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:10,786
<i>and they looked</i>
<i>just like they did before they died.</i>

68
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,623
Some people said
the ghosts talked to them.

69
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:19,044
This is not the work of the undead.

70
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,546
Really?

71
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:27,636
"Undead" is a collective term
referring to corpses controlled by magic.

72
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,222
<i>Like zombies and skeletons.</i>

73
00:06:31,515 --> 00:06:34,685
But in this case, they looked like
how they did before they died.

74
00:06:35,477 --> 00:06:37,938
A corpse wouldn't look like that.

75
00:06:38,647 --> 00:06:41,942
This is a completely
different kind of monster.

76
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:46,196
You seem to know what it is.

77
00:06:47,531 --> 00:06:51,827
It has a twisted personality
so let's try not to run into it.

78
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,957
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

79
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,462
Mistress Frieren,
the villagers are in need of help.

80
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,798
That's something
Himmel and the crew would say.

81
00:07:05,382 --> 00:07:08,552
Because I am a good girl,
unlike you, Mistress Frieren.

82
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:13,057
Well, if you're up for it,
I guess it's fine.

83
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,810
We have to cross the mountain pass anyway.

84
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,703
This is where a villager
went missing recently.

85
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:37,498
Are there any clues…

86
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,250
There's more than enough.

87
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,254
There are traces of magic
that was used here.

88
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,216
Yeah. What kind of
magic do you think it was?

89
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,760
Illusion magic.

90
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:54,223
There are monsters who lure their prey
by using illusions.

91
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:58,268
That's what I read in the book
on the ecology of magic.

92
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,478
Einsam.

93
00:08:01,146 --> 00:08:04,900
Even among those types of monsters,
they are especially cunning, greedy,

94
00:08:04,983 --> 00:08:07,361
and picky eaters who only feed on humans.

95
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:11,490
They lure you in
with illusions of the dead.

96
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,493
People get lured in
by something like that?

97
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:19,081
They show you illusions
of people who were dear to you.

98
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:26,880
But the illusions that Einsam uses
are non-threatening to mages.

99
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:31,009
They easily disperse when they're hit
with highly concentrated mana

100
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,386
like offensive magic.

101
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,764
So you just have to
shoot down the illusions.

102
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,226
Can you shoot?

103
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,731
Of course. After all,
I know they aren't real.

104
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:49,069
I shot down an illusion of my master
as she begged for her life.

105
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,991
But then again, I was used to
hearing her beg for her life,

106
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:57,286
so it didn't hurt my conscience that much.

107
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,622
Even still, it's not the greatest feeling.

108
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,877
What do you mean, you were
used to hearing her beg for her life?

109
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:12,384
It's getting foggy.

110
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:14,845
It's close.

111
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,807
When the illusions appear,
don't hesitate to shoot.

112
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:25,314
Fern.

113
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:32,070
<i>There it is.</i>

114
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,114
<i>This is the "illusion of the dead."</i>

115
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:37,409
<i>I'm calm.</i>

116
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,038
<i>I can shoot it.</i>

117
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,459
You're looking like a real mage now.

118
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:50,088
Because you were a good girl,

119
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,342
I decided to haunt you a little bit.

120
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,930
<i>It's my memory.</i>

121
00:09:58,013 --> 00:10:01,642
It was a good thing
you chose to become a mage.

122
00:10:01,725 --> 00:10:03,894
You've always loved magic…

123
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:07,105
<i>He's using my memories.</i>

124
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:09,691
<i>How cruel.</i>

125
00:10:10,442 --> 00:10:13,612
<i>These are my precious memories.</i>

126
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,532
Fern.

127
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:20,953
She can't, huh?

128
00:10:29,294 --> 00:10:31,004
They chose Himmel, huh?

129
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:35,759
I assumed that it would be
my master again.

130
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,013
Does this mean that I've changed
at least a little?

131
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,520
Frieren, shoot me.

132
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:51,275
Yes, that's something Himmel would say.

133
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,133
This mountain pass is safe now.

134
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:18,802
Mistress Frieren,

135
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:21,805
that was an illusion of Master Heiter.

136
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,309
-He was fake.
-That's right.

137
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,315
Now, let's go see the real one.

138
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,402
After all, we're heading to Aureole.

139
00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:39,281
You're right.

140
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,455
28 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

141
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,582
RIEGEL CANYON IN THE CENTRAL LANDS

142
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,084
That's a dragon?

143
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,213
It's my first time seeing one.

144
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:57,215
Look at the nest.

145
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,260
Do you see that grimoire?

146
00:12:01,094 --> 00:12:03,513
I've been looking for that one.

147
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,515
As usual, you love those things.

148
00:12:06,141 --> 00:12:08,226
But why is it there?

149
00:12:08,852 --> 00:12:12,773
Dragons use items imbued with mana
to build their nests.

150
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,650
The solar dragon.

151
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,779
This one has devoured many adventurers.

152
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,324
Either way, it'd be good to kill it.

153
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,037
-Be careful not to hit the nest.
-Yes.

154
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,177
Mistress Frieren,

155
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,929
it didn't do much.

156
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:46,264
Dragons are so hard.

157
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,767
We have no choice. Let's run!

158
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:08,995
We finally got rid of it.

159
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:11,540
It flies so fast.

160
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,792
We probably can't
fight it in the air either.

161
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:18,422
I… I thought I was going to die.

162
00:13:18,505 --> 00:13:20,424
Let's go back now.

163
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:23,760
If we keep doing this,
we'll eventually take it down.

164
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,433
Right…

165
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,979
Playing tag with a dragon
is not something a mage should do.

166
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:41,194
I guess I'll have to
welcome another member.

167
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:45,699
A vanguard?

168
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:48,452
Yeah, you're looking for one, right?

169
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:51,455
In a village along the Riegel Canyon,

170
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:54,040
there's a warrior named Stark.

171
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,461
When you enter the northern lands,
pick him up while you're at it.

172
00:13:57,544 --> 00:13:59,796
He's my apprentice.

173
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,216
He's a good warrior?

174
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:18,732
I can't believe it's so peaceful here
with a dragon nearby.

175
00:14:18,815 --> 00:14:20,233
I agree.

176
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,695
Mistress Frieren,

177
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:27,491
what kind of magic is
recorded in that grimoire?

178
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,243
A spell that lets you see through clothes.

179
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:37,834
You really only collect
weird spells, don't you.

180
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,461
It's my hobby after all.

181
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,380
But it can be useful.

182
00:14:42,964 --> 00:14:45,550
Depending on what you consider "clothes,"

183
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,220
-you can check for weapons--
-Excuse me.

184
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:50,889
May I have a moment of your time?

185
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,142
Master Stark wants to meet you.

186
00:14:55,018 --> 00:14:57,395
I guess we don't have to look for him.

187
00:15:01,316 --> 00:15:02,651
About three years ago,

188
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,697
<i>that dragon attacked our village.</i>

189
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,917
<i>That is when Master Stark appeared.</i>

190
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,380
<i>Even when he was face-to-face with</i>
<i>the dragon, he did not budge an inch.</i>

191
00:15:23,463 --> 00:15:25,674
<i>After a very long staredown,</i>

192
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,134
the dragon went away.

193
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:32,472
Ever since then,
thanks to the fact that he stays here,

194
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,683
we are able to live peacefully

195
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,894
without being attacked by the dragon.

196
00:15:39,437 --> 00:15:42,440
Then if we can get
Master Stark to help us,

197
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,192
we can take the dragon down.

198
00:15:44,776 --> 00:15:45,944
I hope so.

199
00:15:48,613 --> 00:15:51,950
Can I become
a strong warrior like you, Stark?

200
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:52,951
You can.

201
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,204
But warriors aren't all that great.

202
00:15:58,081 --> 00:16:00,709
Oh, Grandma!

203
00:16:08,758 --> 00:16:11,052
You two were messing with the dragon?

204
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:15,557
Don't agitate it too much.
It'll put the village in danger.

205
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:20,312
Dragons are more terrifying
than you think.

206
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,150
This scar on my forehead
is from when I fought

207
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:27,819
-a shadow dragon--
-That scar is not that special.

208
00:16:30,196 --> 00:16:33,575
Were you sent by my master? Who are you?

209
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:36,578
Frieren the mage.

210
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,791
Grandma, can you give us a moment alone?

211
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:46,588
Don't worry. They're friends of my master.

212
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,305
Master was mad, wasn't he?

213
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:57,474
Since I left without saying anything.

214
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,937
Stark, why haven't you
taken down the dragon?

215
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,023
There's no reason
for you to stay in this village.

216
00:17:05,106 --> 00:17:08,485
Can you tell me what you want first?

217
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:11,738
If you want me to go back to my master,
I'm not going to.

218
00:17:12,864 --> 00:17:15,450
We want you to join us as a vanguard.

219
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:19,871
But first, we want you to help us
take down the solar dragon.

220
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,291
I want the grimoire that's in its nest.

221
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,086
-Why?
-It's just my hobby.

222
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,504
There's no special reason.

223
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,548
This is a solar dragon
we're talking about.

224
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,259
It's not something you fight
for no reason.

225
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,269
Amazing!

226
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,522
Well…

227
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:49,901
There were idiots who praised me
for the spells I collected.

228
00:17:50,568 --> 00:17:52,779
I guess that's my reason.

229
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,157
Praised you, huh?

230
00:17:58,785 --> 00:18:00,996
-What a silly reason.
-Right?

231
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:04,457
I don't mind joining you.

232
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,044
Master told you to take me along, right?

233
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:12,007
But you will have to take down
the solar dragon no matter what.

234
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:15,176
Honestly, I can't do it alone.

235
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,556
Frieren, you can take it down, right?

236
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,560
Most definitely, as long as
you can distract it for 30 seconds.

237
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,645
I see.

238
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:28,606
For 30 seconds, huh?

239
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,902
Do I have to be in charge of that?

240
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,321
What is this man talking about?

241
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,158
I knew it.

242
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,828
Stark, how many monsters have you fought?

243
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,580
Zero!

244
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,332
Help me, Frieren!

245
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,586
<i>I actually tried</i>
<i>to stand up against it at first!</i>

246
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,590
<i>But I was so scared</i>
<i>that I couldn't move an inch.</i>

247
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:56,342
<i>It slices through houses</i>

248
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,344
<i>like they're vegetables!</i>

249
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,598
<i>Humans are not meant to fight</i>
<i>such a thing!</i>

250
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,977
<i>But when the dragon</i>
<i>spared my life on a whim…</i>

251
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:10,106
<i>For some reason</i>

252
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,859
<i>the dragon stopped attacking the village</i>
<i>and I became a hero.</i>

253
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:16,362
<i>The villagers are such nice people!</i>

254
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,698
You're still young, so you need to eat up!

255
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,618
Stark, show me your new move!

256
00:19:21,701 --> 00:19:25,121
I can't run away
from this situation anymore!

257
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,792
Mistress Frieren, he is no good.

258
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,502
Let's find someone else.

259
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:33,213
Don't leave me!

260
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:36,549
No, he can fight the dragon.

261
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:37,884
I know he can.

262
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,637
You sound like a doting parent.

263
00:20:01,866 --> 00:20:05,537
Stark, I will give you one night.

264
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:07,789
Think about it.

265
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:11,709
You know you can't keep this up forever.

266
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,017
I heard you met Master Stark.

267
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:30,478
Wasn't he a nice boy?

268
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,231
He always eats at our place,

269
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:35,024
like it's the most delicious food ever.

270
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,153
Master Stark is loved by the people.

271
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:42,157
Well, it does seem like
he is a kind person.

272
00:20:43,074 --> 00:20:44,325
Kind?

273
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,787
All I saw was a coward.

274
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:50,790
I don't disagree that he is a coward.

275
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,043
Remember when you fought
a monster for the first time, even you…

276
00:20:56,254 --> 00:20:57,672
Fine, I'll forget about that.

277
00:21:01,217 --> 00:21:02,177
Jeez…

278
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,680
When you were small, you used to be
so innocent and cute.

279
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:11,352
By the way, why doesn't the dragon
attack this village?

280
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,606
I don't know.
Maybe it's just not in the mood

281
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:15,773
or…

282
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:19,944
What's that sound?

283
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,030
It must be Stark.

284
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:25,450
If you're curious, go and see.

285
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,911
I'm going to sleep.

286
00:21:46,554 --> 00:21:47,680
He's a good warrior?

287
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:52,268
In the past,

288
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:55,188
when his hometown was attacked by demons,

289
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:59,067
he ran away by himself
like the coward he is.

290
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:02,320
<i>Just like me.</i>

291
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:08,451
That's why I taught him everything I know.

292
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:13,081
Now, he has become someone
who can fight for others.

293
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:17,585
I see. He is a good warrior then.

294
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:41,317
So this was the aftermath
of his training, huh?

295
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:21,042
<i>-Time waits for no one.</i>
<i>-That old hag.</i>

296
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,210
<i>Isn't that dangerous?</i>

297
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:23,419
<i>Do not cause</i>

298
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,088
<i>-any trouble in this town.</i>
<i>-He was disappointed in me.</i>

299
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,339
<i>Your hands are trembling.</i>

300
00:24:26,422 --> 00:24:27,715
<i>You even tremble the same way.</i>

301
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,801
<i>"The Hero of the Village."</i>

302
