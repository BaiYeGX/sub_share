ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

2
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:37,471
So that's Äußerst,
the largest city of magic

3
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,181
in the northern lands?

4
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:43,352
It's still pretty far from here.
We'll have to catch a coach along the way.

5
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,311
29 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

6
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,229
KÜHL REGION IN THE NORTHERN LANDS

7
00:01:46,313 --> 00:01:50,026
Once Mistress Frieren gets
her first-class mage certification there,

8
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,736
we can enter the Northern Plateau.

9
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,657
It doesn't really have to be me
who gets the certification.

10
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,909
It'll soon become outdated anyway.

11
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,370
You should get it, Fern.

12
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,748
You don't know, Mistress Frieren?

13
00:02:04,665 --> 00:02:06,667
<i>Out of all the mages out there,</i>

14
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,170
<i>only a small handful of seasoned mages</i>

15
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,255
<i>can become a first-class mage.</i>

16
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:13,883
I am nowhere near that.

17
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,346
-Is that so?
-You seem so uninterested.

18
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:21,974
I know it's a bit late to ask this,

19
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,976
but why do we need such an amazing mage

20
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,479
to accompany us into the Northern Plateau?

21
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:29,315
The Northern Plateau has always had

22
00:02:29,398 --> 00:02:33,736
lots of monsters who use
cunning spells like the Einsam.

23
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:38,991
It's always been a dangerous area to cross
without a priest and skilled mage.

24
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:41,577
But the fact that they're

25
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,456
requiring the presence of a valuable,
seasoned mage just to pass through,

26
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,376
means there must be something
bad happening in the Northern Plateau.

27
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:55,007
Once we get to Äußerst,
we have to look into the exam.

28
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,594
According to Fern,
there seems to be a practical exam too.

29
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,846
I'll have to think of a plan.

30
00:03:01,847 --> 00:03:03,599
With your level of mana,

31
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:06,268
I'm sure you can easily ace
any kind of exam.

32
00:03:06,977 --> 00:03:08,646
Even when you're suppressing it,

33
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:11,273
you have as much mana
as a seasoned, elderly mage.

34
00:03:12,441 --> 00:03:14,401
Don't call me an elderly mage.

35
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,363
Oh no, now she's sulking.

36
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:20,241
Calling her an elderly mage
was going a bit too far.

37
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:21,784
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:26,539
Stark, I haven't forgotten about
the time you called me, "stinking hag."

39
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,541
That was ages ago.

40
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,793
Whatever, I'm going to sleep.

41
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:33,504
Wake me up when we get to Äußerst.

42
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,756
Jeez…

43
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:40,636
Never mind…

44
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,012
Huh? What's wrong?

45
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:45,307
Half of the sky was covered.

46
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,810
Huh?

47
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:49,770
Let me tell you this, Fern.

48
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,024
A mage's strength
isn't determined based on mana alone.

49
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:58,279
You must factor in technique, experience,
the type of spells, control,

50
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:00,197
hard work, and guts.

51
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,700
Some of those sound like a warrior.

52
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,994
And finally, talent.

53
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,622
Throughout all the years I've lived,

54
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:13,294
I've lost against mages with
less mana than me 11 times.

55
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,838
Out of which four were demons.

56
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,591
<i>Qual was one of them, right?</i>

57
00:04:19,675 --> 00:04:21,468
One was an elf, like me.

58
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,431
And the remaining six were humans.

59
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:31,604
The town of the graf's domain should be
coming into sight soon.

60
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:34,690
The road to Äußerst sure is tough.

61
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:35,649
NORTHERN LANDS
OUTSKIRTS OF GRAF GRANAT'S DOMAIN

62
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,110
Maybe I'll take a little break.

63
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:43,157
Hey girlie,
that's a nice staff you've got there.

64
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:49,455
Oh, what? More thieves?

65
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:53,209
It finally became peaceful
after Aura was killed,

66
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,629
but now we're seeing an increase
in people like you.

67
00:04:56,712 --> 00:04:58,172
Who told you to speak?

68
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,175
Hurry up and get your stuff--

69
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:08,265
How dare you…

70
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,360
If you don't want to die,
hurry up and get lost.

71
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,738
Let's go.

72
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,743
Thank you. What a life saver.

73
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,746
I'm Übel, a mage.

74
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,123
I'm Kraft, a warrior monk.

75
00:05:33,707 --> 00:05:35,960
Oh, are you an elf?

76
00:05:36,043 --> 00:05:38,128
How rare. You're the first one I've met.

77
00:05:40,047 --> 00:05:42,132
You have the eyes of a killer.

78
00:05:45,552 --> 00:05:47,513
I didn't do that to save you.

79
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,393
<i>I found the chopped up remains</i>
<i>of thieves in a nearby forest.</i>

80
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,312
They were victims of a mage.

81
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,648
And a terrifyingly skilled one at that.

82
00:05:58,607 --> 00:06:00,234
Oh yeah?

83
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,904
Did you come here to lecture me?

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,075
No. I am an adventurer like you.

85
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:11,912
I'm not that narrow-minded to criticize
you for killing in self-defense.

86
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,541
I just spared
the lives that I could, that's all.

87
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:18,919
What a sly old man. How boring.

88
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,672
Are you heading to Äußerst?

89
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:26,176
Yeah, to take the first-class mage exam.

90
00:06:27,219 --> 00:06:29,805
Frieren mentioned something like that too.

91
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:35,769
I can't wait to hear her stories
the next time we meet.

92
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:37,855
CONTINENTAL MAGIC ASSOCIATION
NORTHERN BRANCH

93
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,815
The next exam will be in two months.

94
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,067
The first-class mage exam

95
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,070
takes place once in three years,
so please be aware of that.

96
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:47,614
Also, to qualify for the exam,

97
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,993
you must have at least
a fifth-class mage certification.

98
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,706
Fern, good luck.

99
00:06:57,499 --> 00:07:00,669
Mistress Frieren, I can't do this alone.

100
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,587
You can do it.

101
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:04,381
What happens if I fail?

102
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,717
The exam only happens once in three years.

103
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:11,096
Then we'll either hire a first-class mage
or go by sea.

104
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,558
That will be very costly.

105
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:17,478
We'll have to cut back on snacks again.

106
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,900
But I'm uncertified.

107
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,324
They won't accept my Holy Emblem, right?

108
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,744
What is up with you and that relic?

109
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:35,579
You, there…

110
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,583
Can I take a look at that?

111
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,301
Are you planning to take
the first-class mage exam?

112
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:54,264
I guess I'll be taking the exam.

113
00:07:55,307 --> 00:07:58,018
I can't believe there are still people
who remember this.

114
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:01,688
Is that thing actually very valuable?

115
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:04,066
It's supposed to be, at least.

116
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:10,280
Frieren,
you're not in the Magic Guild, huh?

117
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,410
The organizations that manage mages
change so frequently.

118
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,746
It's a bother to keep rejoining each time.

119
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,914
I see.

120
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,167
And plus, I have this.

121
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:25,421
The Holy Emblem. Amazing, right?

122
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,592
What is this rusty necklace? Do you know?

123
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,969
No idea.

124
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,184
I see.

125
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:44,690
This was the only thing that could prove
that I am a mage.

126
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,693
Frieren,

127
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:50,696
it's true that we don't know
about that necklace.

128
00:08:51,488 --> 00:08:55,826
But we know that you are an amazing mage.

129
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,287
Isn't that enough?

130
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:01,957
But you'll soon be dead.

131
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:10,716
Mistress Frieren…

132
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:16,722
We know that you are
an amazing mage, Mistress Frieren.

133
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,562
I guess so.

134
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,984
According to
the Continental Magic Association,

135
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:31,695
mages are generally considered

136
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:34,615
full-fledged mages from the fifth-class.

137
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:37,993
Why did you take the third-class exam?

138
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:41,663
Because that was the earliest exam
that was available.

139
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:46,752
There are 600 mages
from the fifth-class and above.

140
00:09:46,835 --> 00:09:51,256
In total, including sixth to ninth-class
apprentices, there are only 2000 mages.

141
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,510
<i>Among which 45 are first-class mages.</i>

142
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,512
<i>The first-class exam is held</i>
<i>every three years</i>

143
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,139
<i>and only in the northern branch in Äußerst</i>

144
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,767
<i>and the headquarters</i>
<i>in the Holy City of Strahl.</i>

145
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:06,188
A lot of times, nobody passes the exam.

146
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:09,149
And it's common to have casualties.

147
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,902
{\an8}It seems pretty difficult.

148
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:16,406
{\an8}By the way, the number of mages
has really gone down.

149
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:18,283
{\an8}There used to be more?

150
00:10:19,117 --> 00:10:22,579
100 years ago, at the height of
the Demon King's military offense,

151
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:26,667
you would come across mages
just by walking around town.

152
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,712
Nowadays, you won't see one unless
you come to a city of magic.

153
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,383
Well, I guess we should train

154
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,552
for the exam in two months.

155
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,921
{\an8}We will now
begin the first-class mage exam.

156
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:13,839
{\an8}FIRST STAGE PROCTOR
GENAU, FIRST-CLASS MAGE

157
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,842
We have a talented bunch this year.

158
00:11:17,801 --> 00:11:21,680
Wirbel, a second-class mage,
who has been fighting the remnants

159
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:23,682
of the Demon King's army for many years

160
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:25,851
as captain of the Northern Magic Corps.

161
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:31,898
Denken, a second-class mage
and an experienced, sly old man

162
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,568
who won a bloodstained power struggle

163
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:36,361
and became an Imperial Mage.

164
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:38,780
Fern, a third-class mage,

165
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,117
and the youngest
in history to pass the third-class exam

166
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,119
at the top of her class.

167
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,122
However, we also have a problem child.

168
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,708
Übel, a third-class mage,

169
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,296
who killed the first-class mage proctor
at the second-class exam two years ago

170
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:56,757
and was disqualified.

171
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,927
Some other promising candidates are…

172
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:07,225
<i>Someone over there is emitting mana</i>
<i>like a seasoned, elderly mage.</i>

173
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,395
-Who is that?
-Who knows.

174
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:14,858
I will now announce
details on the first stage of the exam.

175
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,362
You will battle in parties.
All 57 participants

176
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,989
will be put in parties of three

177
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,158
to take this exam.

178
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:26,912
Now then, we will divide the groups.

179
00:12:28,455 --> 00:12:30,040
<i>A bangle, huh?</i>

180
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:35,629
<i>There's a number written on it.</i>
<i>I guess I'm party number two?</i>

181
00:12:36,838 --> 00:12:40,550
<i>By sending mana into it,</i>
<i>you can tell where your party members are.</i>

182
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,387
<i>This is how you can find your party, huh?</i>

183
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:47,057
<i>What an interesting idea.</i>

184
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,892
<i>Unlike a regular party,</i>

185
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,814
<i>this is an impromptu party</i>
<i>with a bunch of eccentric mages,</i>

186
00:12:53,897 --> 00:12:56,024
<i>so it'll be hard to work together.</i>

187
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,570
<i>First impressions</i>
<i>are important in these cases.</i>

188
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,031
<i>I'd better try to keep things peaceful.</i>

189
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,535
<i>I can sense the other bangles around here.</i>

190
00:13:06,618 --> 00:13:10,414
Ouch! It's going to rip out!

191
00:13:10,497 --> 00:13:11,915
Don't you dare!

192
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:14,626
-I'll kill you!
-Go ahead.

193
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,672
<i>They're already fighting.</i>

194
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,928
Nice to meet you.

195
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,014
Nice to meet you.

196
00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:31,351
GROBE BASIN IN THE NORTHERN LANDS
FIRST STAGE EXAM LOCATION

197
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,938
I will explain the rules
for the first stage of the exam.

198
00:13:36,231 --> 00:13:39,985
Small birds called Stille
live within this exam location.

199
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:44,865
I've given each party one cage.

200
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:47,492
There are two conditions
to pass the first stage.

201
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,872
To have a caged Stille in your possession
by sundown tomorrow.

202
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,791
-Get away!
-And to have

203
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,626
all party members present.

204
00:13:58,086 --> 00:14:00,005
You are free to do what you want,

205
00:14:00,922 --> 00:14:04,009
but if anyone leaves the exam location,

206
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:08,013
everyone in their party
will immediately become disqualified.

207
00:14:08,763 --> 00:14:11,391
Does he really have to say that
after he put up

208
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:14,895
a powerful barrier that won't even
let a speck of dust through?

209
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:16,605
There's no way out anyway.

210
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:19,858
They're actually listening
to his explanation?

211
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:23,487
Well then, the first stage
of the exam begins now.

212
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,532
-We should think of a strategy first.
-Are you stupid?

213
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:30,952
We can't think of any strategy
without finding it first.

214
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,497
They're still fighting.

215
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:37,751
Why don't we introduce ourselves
while we walk?

216
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,633
Also, do rock-paper-scissors to pick
who can hold the cage.

217
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:52,849
I'm Frieren. Nice to meet you.

218
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,852
I'm Lawine, a third-class mage.

219
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:59,606
I'm Kanne. I'm also a third-class mage.

220
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:03,735
Lawine and I are childhood friends
and we went to the same magic academy.

221
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,405
Do the two of you
know anything about Stille?

222
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,990
-No.
-Nope.

223
00:15:09,574 --> 00:15:13,995
I know about them,
but I've never seen one in real life.

224
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,624
So let's find a Stille
and observe it first.

225
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,272
I'm tired.

226
00:15:40,355 --> 00:15:42,440
What a slob.

227
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,484
Let's take a break.

228
00:15:47,654 --> 00:15:50,156
I still have energy,
so I'll take a look ahead.

229
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,826
It's safer to stay together.

230
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:55,662
Shut up. It's not efficient that way.

231
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:58,790
Are you strong, Lawine?

232
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:02,043
-More than her.
-You want to fight me?

233
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:03,920
Compared to me?

234
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,008
I wouldn't want to fight you.

235
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:12,053
I see. Okay, you can go take a look.

236
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:15,932
-But come back if it gets dangerous.
-Okay.

237
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:19,144
Also, be watchful of the sky.

238
00:16:19,227 --> 00:16:20,395
I know.

239
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,192
<i>Is this party going to be okay?</i>

240
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:29,571
Frieren, you seem like a teacher.

241
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:31,197
You must be fit for a leader.

242
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:34,367
Only because you two are always fighting.

243
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,952
I don't like to take charge.

244
00:16:36,536 --> 00:16:37,662
I'm sorry.

245
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,582
We've always been like this.

246
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,920
By the way, what do you mean by
"be watchful of the sky"?

247
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:47,047
Exactly that.

248
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,549
Are you not good at mana detection?

249
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,552
-Why?
-Hey.

250
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,723
-That was fast.
-I found a Stille.

251
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,686
Good work, Lawine.

252
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,064
Now, let's observe it and--

253
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,862
Didn't I say to observe it?

254
00:17:11,446 --> 00:17:13,365
-It'll get away.
-No.

255
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,617
Good job, Kanne.

256
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:21,873
That's impressive.

257
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,711
But you should take cover soon.

258
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,838
Huh? Why?

259
00:17:34,052 --> 00:17:38,723
Stilles are extremely sturdy
and they can fly at supersonic speed.

260
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,643
That level of restraint is pointless.

261
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:46,648
-Seriously? It's already out of sight.
-We were so close.

262
00:17:46,731 --> 00:17:49,609
To capture it,
we have to closely observe it.

263
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,238
We'll set aside this day
to just observe the Stille.

264
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:59,035
<i>Kanne manipulated the water</i>
<i>and Lawine froze it.</i>

265
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,247
<i>The timing was perfectly in sync.</i>

266
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,040
<i>What high-level coordination.</i>

267
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,751
<i>That isn't something</i>
<i>you can achieve overnight.</i>

268
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:11,548
<i>I was worried about this group,</i>
<i>but it might work out.</i>

269
00:18:11,631 --> 00:18:13,008
Let's follow it right away.

270
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:16,261
We should check the lake first.

271
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,638
-Why? We should go now.
<i>-Oh no…</i>

272
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,849
<i>They're fighting again.</i>

273
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,256
What's this noise? Oh?

274
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,719
Frieren's not here.

275
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:05,185
I knew it. It's faint,
but this is the sound of rain.

276
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,359
But it's not raining.

277
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:16,863
Oh, is that what it is?

278
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:19,199
So does that mean--

279
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:24,287
A monster!

280
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,090
My staff…

281
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,261
Lawine!

282
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,983
Didn't I tell you to
be watchful of the sky?

283
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:05,537
Did you calm down?

284
00:20:06,412 --> 00:20:07,497
Yeah.

285
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:10,250
You called out Lawine's name.

286
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,838
I thought you hated Lawine.

287
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:17,423
Yeah…

288
00:20:18,424 --> 00:20:19,467
Right?

289
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,720
Then how are you two able
to coordinate so well?

290
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:24,514
How strange.

291
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,726
I may not seem like it, but I'm a coward.

292
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:33,731
So a lot of times, I can't do anything
in the most crucial moments.

293
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:40,238
That happened on
the first day of flight magic training.

294
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:46,995
Everyone who left before you
are already way over there.

295
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:49,998
You're above water,
so it's not like you'll die.

296
00:20:50,623 --> 00:20:53,585
If you don't have the courage,
want me to kick you off?

297
00:20:54,085 --> 00:20:55,753
I hate you, Lawine.

298
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,839
I know that.

299
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,467
You're always saying mean things to me.

300
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,096
I'm the type who feeds off commendation.

301
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,182
Stop joking.

302
00:21:07,682 --> 00:21:11,769
You were spoiled by your dad and mom
and look at where that got you.

303
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,940
I'd gladly be nice to you,
if that's what it takes for you to fly.

304
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,277
Then say good things about me.

305
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,155
Come on, are you serious?

306
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,164
You're doing your best
even though you're really a coward.

307
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,668
It's your good trait.

308
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:41,549
-Say more.
-Huh? Why should I?

309
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,721
You work hard when nobody is looking.

310
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:50,350
You're attentive and considerate.

311
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,352
More.

312
00:21:55,563 --> 00:21:58,066
You're cute when you smile.

313
00:21:58,816 --> 00:21:59,984
Huh? Gross…

314
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,368
That was close!

315
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:11,829
So you could fly after all.

316
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,499
I won't be nice to you anymore.

317
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,379
Lawine is rough,
but she's a good leader to me.

318
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,924
Thanks to her, I've learned that
even frightening things

319
00:22:23,007 --> 00:22:25,385
can turn out okay if I don't overthink it.

320
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,598
By the way, Frieren,

321
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,979
I've realized something interesting.

322
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,486
Will this be useful in any way?

323
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:45,530
I see.

324
00:22:45,613 --> 00:22:49,075
We might be able to catch a Stille easily.

325
00:24:20,416 --> 00:24:21,417
<i>That's abnormal.</i>

326
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:22,627
<i>-I'll show you!</i>
<i>-You make it sound so easy.</i>

327
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,961
<i>-How immature…</i>
<i>-Someone detected it.</i>

328
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,922
<i>-It's time for a battle.</i>
<i>-Shut up.</i>

329
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:29,842
<i>This is the second party's elaborate plan.</i>

330
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,843
