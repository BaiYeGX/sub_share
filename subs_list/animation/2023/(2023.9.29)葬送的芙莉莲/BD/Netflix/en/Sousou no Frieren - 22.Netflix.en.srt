1
00:00:05,463 --> 00:00:09,216

ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

11
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,382
It's evening, huh?

12
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,427
Spending a day doing nothing isn't so bad.

13
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:26,520
What?

14
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:31,692
All right, all right.

15
00:02:43,537 --> 00:02:47,666
Fern! I thought you were
taking the first-class mage exam?

16
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,296
The first stage ended,
so we came back last night.

17
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:56,634
Master Stark,
it's already evening, isn't it?

18
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:57,551
Huh?

19
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,263
You were asleep, weren't you?

20
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:05,392
Did you stay up late?

21
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,772
-Yes.
-What else?

22
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,150
I drank juice in the middle of the night.

23
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:17,530
I'm sorry! I said, I'm sorry!

24
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:20,157
Look at what you've done. Now she's mad.

25
00:03:20,866 --> 00:03:24,245
Mistress Frieren, you yourself
just woke up a moment ago.

26
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:25,913
That backfired on me.

27
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,628
We'll have to spend the day
trying to get on Fern's good side.

28
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:34,588
What are you planning to do?

29
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,341
Why don't we eat something tasty?

30
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:38,676
Something tasty?

31
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:40,761
It's a little expensive,

32
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:44,431
but I found a nice place when I came here
with Himmel and everyone.

33
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:48,018
But that's more than 80 years ago, right?

34
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,687
Does it still exist?

35
00:04:07,037 --> 00:04:10,249
Oh, the light turned on!

36
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:12,293
See? I told you it's easy to fix.

37
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:17,047
-Thank you as always, Richter.
-No problem.

38
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:20,384
Oh, that reminds me. Take these as well.

39
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,387
Bye now.

40
00:04:30,477 --> 00:04:33,314
Hey, Grandma! I'm not a kid anymore.

41
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:35,441
I'm an old man already.

42
00:04:36,066 --> 00:04:39,945
You're still a child in the eyes
of an elderly person like me.

43
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,822
You used to like those, didn't you?

44
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:56,378
Sorry, but it's closing time already.

45
00:04:57,004 --> 00:05:00,591
Some crazy grandpa forced me
into a fistfight.

46
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,510
So I need to get some rest.

47
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:07,348
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Richter.

48
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:09,892
In that case, why don't we go out to eat?

49
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:12,102
There's a restaurant I'm looking for,

50
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,980
but Laufen and I don't know
our way around here.

51
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,860
First of all, Laufen,
why are you with Denken?

52
00:05:21,153 --> 00:05:23,030
Where did you get
that thing you're eating?

53
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:26,367
The old man bought it for me.
I'm not giving you any.

54
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,286
Jeez, he's treating you
like his grandchild!

55
00:05:30,037 --> 00:05:32,873
Go away.
We're not in the same party anymore.

56
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,169
You really don't know how to
get on in the world, do you?

57
00:05:37,753 --> 00:05:40,714
If you want to live as a mage,

58
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:44,551
it wouldn't hurt to get on my good side.

59
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,304
There are a ton of restaurants out there.

60
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,472
Go pick a random one.

61
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:50,933
My wife…

62
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:55,646
When she was still alive,
my wife and I went to this restaurant.

63
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:57,982
What we ate there was unforgettable.

64
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,820
You're paying, right?

65
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:05,030
Of course.

66
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:07,783
I told you, "It won't hurt."

67
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:39,106
-Four-eyes.
-Huh?

68
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:41,775
Übel.

69
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:43,986
It's my first time meeting you.

70
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:46,989
I see you don't use
your clone around town.

71
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,659
If you just want to chat,
can we keep walking?

72
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,202
That's fine,

73
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,205
but if you run away,
I might accidentally kill you.

74
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,002
Can I ask you a question?

75
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:01,754
Huh?

76
00:07:02,337 --> 00:07:03,589
You…

77
00:07:04,506 --> 00:07:07,009
think nothing of killing people, right?

78
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,847
Why didn't you kill Wirbel?

79
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,266
You had the chance to kill him.

80
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,395
You were watching?
I can't let my guard down around you.

81
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:25,402
It's hard to put into words…

82
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,279
How surprising.

83
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,823
Your hands are stained with blood already,

84
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,409
but you still wish to be human, huh?

85
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:38,165
That's right. This is the time I need
to find my resolve to kill.

86
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,419
I guess
it's because I could relate to him.

87
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,590
It made me want to buy time
before I kill too.

88
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:51,553
<i>I can't move my body.</i>

89
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,263
<i>This is…</i>

90
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,474
Sorganeil.

91
00:07:55,557 --> 00:07:57,935
A spell that restrains those within sight.

92
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,397
The type of magic one specializes in

93
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,441
greatly reflects their life and character.

94
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,238
I've always been this way.

95
00:08:09,988 --> 00:08:13,742
When I can relate to people,
I am able to use their magic.

96
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,412
When I can't relate,
I can't use their magic.

97
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:19,915
Four-eyes, your clone

98
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:24,336
is a perfect replica of you
and functions just like you.

99
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,380
What goes on in your mind

100
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:29,049
and what kind of life have you led?

101
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,592
Tell me.

102
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:33,470
I see…

103
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:37,099
So you're the type
who uses magic intuitively, huh?

104
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,894
The type who uses a spell
without even understanding

105
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,479
its mechanisms.

106
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:49,236
You know,
I hate those kinds of empty-headed people.

107
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,114
You didn't answer my question.

108
00:08:52,197 --> 00:08:55,868
What I'm trying to say is,
"I don't like you, so I won't tell you."

109
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,498
Feel free to kill me if you want.

110
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:05,878
Although, if you do,
you'd never be able to relate to me.

111
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,553
No, I won't kill you.

112
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:18,348
I think I got the gist
of the kind of person you are.

113
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,683
Is that so?

114
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:21,643
I think I want to know more.

115
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,983
Where were you headed?

116
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:31,153
Who knows? Don't follow me.

117
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:33,655
This is it.

118
00:09:34,406 --> 00:09:37,117
You have a good eye, Denken.

119
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,204
This is the best restaurant in this town.

120
00:09:40,287 --> 00:09:41,163
I come here a lot.

121
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,835
It's already been 50 years since the time
my wife and I came here,

122
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,379
but it still has the same atmosphere.

123
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,425
How strange is that.

124
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,057
Are you sure?

125
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:03,894
Are you sure I can order
as many desserts as I want?

126
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:04,811
Go ahead.

127
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,314
Denken, it's Frieren.

128
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:09,733
What should I order?

129
00:10:09,816 --> 00:10:11,276
I recommend…

130
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,280
I'm allowed such a luxury
even though it's not my birthday?

131
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:17,074
Let them be.

132
00:10:17,157 --> 00:10:18,951
They look like
they're enjoying themselves.

133
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:21,995
Dining is meant to be enjoyable.

134
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,748
And that's what we're here to do.

135
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:38,178
All right, time to stuff myself.

136
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,972
That's a crazy amount of food.

137
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:43,225
Every once in a while,
Mistress Frieren eats like this.

138
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:52,025
Thank you for retrieving
this knife, our family heirloom,

139
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,735
from the demons.

140
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:57,030
I, Lecker,
the greatest chef of the century,

141
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,824
will show you my utmost hospitality

142
00:10:58,907 --> 00:11:02,077
and reward you as much as possible.

143
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,705
That's quite a lot of food you have.

144
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:09,334
The food here is delicious,
so I have to enjoy it as much as I can.

145
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,378
You don't have to eat so much at once.

146
00:11:11,461 --> 00:11:12,879
Just come back again.

147
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,884
There are so many things that I never got
to eat again because of that mentality.

148
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:22,639
There is no need to worry,
Mistress Frieren.

149
00:11:25,058 --> 00:11:28,437
I plan to pass down our restaurant's
recipe for many generations.

150
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,148
Whether that is 100 or 200 years from now.

151
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:38,905
I see. I find it interesting
that chef's always say that.

152
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,073
But despite saying that,

153
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,535
they also change recipes of old dishes
to leave a mark in history.

154
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:49,916
When they do that, just go look
for something more delicious.

155
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,753
Excuse me, Master Himmel,

156
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:56,298
but nobody in this world
can surpass my cooking.

157
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:59,426
Then you must make sure
to pass it on to the future.

158
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:04,056
That is the reward
I demand from you this time.

159
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,019
If that is our hero's request,

160
00:12:09,102 --> 00:12:12,314
I will make sure to accomplish
this feat which no other chef

161
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,982
has ever accomplished.

162
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:23,408
Frieren! This tastes so good!

163
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,703
Is it okay for me to be this happy?

164
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,628
Jeez…

165
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:38,006
After all that he said,
the flavor did change in the end.

166
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,634
But…

167
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:44,596
I don't have to go looking
for something more delicious.

168
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,058
This tastes even better than back then.

169
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,982
This is really delicious.

170
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:59,152
You've got some
on your cheek, Master Stark.

171
00:12:59,736 --> 00:13:02,072
You've got to eat your vegetables too.

172
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:04,282
You're literally becoming her grandpa.

173
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,537
You're a surprisingly light eater.

174
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,288
Mind your own business.

175
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:15,001
That was delicious, Mistress Frieren.

176
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:20,173
I'm glad she's in a good mood now.

177
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,677
By the way, did you have enough money?

178
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:26,763
I used all the money I saved up.

179
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:32,310
That is indeed, the state of nothingness.

180
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:37,357
I commend you for
discovering the quintessence of strength.

181
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:42,404
There is nothing left for me to teach you.

182
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:54,916
Who is that old man?

183
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,710
Some stranger.

184
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,713
He starts talking to me
whenever I'm training.

185
00:14:00,338 --> 00:14:03,300
You always attract the weirdest people.

186
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,927
Well, whatever. Do you have a moment?

187
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:08,722
I could use your help.

188
00:14:09,222 --> 00:14:10,682
What happened?

189
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:15,896
What? She's super angry.

190
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:18,398
Her mood is worse than yesterday.

191
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,608
Yeah…

192
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:21,610
What did you do?

193
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:25,864
I was in charge of shopping today,
but I overslept.

194
00:14:25,947 --> 00:14:28,366
But that happens all the time.

195
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,785
Why is this time different?

196
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:33,872
Fern is the type that bottles up
her frustration until it explodes.

197
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:36,166
What happens when it explodes?

198
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,294
She stops talking to me.

199
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:41,213
What a childish way of fighting.

200
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,548
Please, Stark!

201
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:47,677
Be our mediator. She won't speak to me.

202
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:51,389
What? No way! She's scary!

203
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,892
You're right.

204
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:55,602
Sorry for asking you such a thing.

205
00:15:02,609 --> 00:15:05,237
Um, Fern,

206
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:09,282
as you can see, she seems to be repentant.

207
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:12,536
-I want to eat…
-Huh?

208
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,789
I want to eat a snack.

209
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:22,963
<i>She's such a pain.</i>

210
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:26,508
Well then, let's all go buy it together.

211
00:15:26,591 --> 00:15:28,969
Did I have any more of my savings left?

212
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,728
Hey, that guy…

213
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,774
Isn't he Wirbel
from the Northern Magic Corps?

214
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,611
You're a warrior, aren't you?

215
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,072
Huh? What is this about?

216
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,574
What do you think?

217
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:53,952
Huh? What?

218
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:57,330
This guy is no good.

219
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,460
What is he doing?

220
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,505
Sorry for the wait, Kanne.

221
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,052
You're dressed cuter than usual, Lawine.

222
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:14,723
My older brothers are back
from the Imperial Capital.

223
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,229
<i>They keep buying me useless things.</i>

224
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,857
<i>I'm not a dress-up doll,</i>
<i>for crying out loud.</i>

225
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:28,236
<i>Mom was enjoying it just as much</i>
<i>and didn't stop them at all.</i>

226
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,283
You're more spoiled than me.

227
00:16:33,366 --> 00:16:35,952
If you think so,
I'd gladly trade places with you.

228
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,247
Always being compared with
your capable brothers is a nightmare.

229
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,918
Come on, let's go.
I need to get some fresh air.

230
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:52,135
All right,
then I will escort you today, Lawine.

231
00:16:57,223 --> 00:17:00,018
Ouch! You're ripping my hair out!

232
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,501
Um, Fern?

233
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:26,586
Which one would you like?

234
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:30,674
Anything is fine.
Master Stark, you can choose.

235
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:35,178
<i>That usually means</i>
<i>she won't be happy with anything.</i>

236
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,682
What should I do?

237
00:17:38,765 --> 00:17:40,892
Don't ask me. I don't know.

238
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:48,316
-Isn't that Frieren?
-Yeah.

239
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,238
What great timing!

240
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:56,199
We were just thinking about
visiting your inn.

241
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:58,159
Who are they?

242
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,788
We were in the same party
during the first stage of the exam.

243
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:06,042
Frieren really helped us out a lot!

244
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,586
She was also like a teacher to us.

245
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,757
Only because you're always fighting.

246
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,926
That's Lawine's fault.

247
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,637
<i>I feel so out of place</i>
<i>amongst all these girls.</i>

248
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,638
Now, now…

249
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:19,723
-Hey!
-Huh?

250
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:21,808
You're a warrior, right?

251
00:18:21,891 --> 00:18:24,352
What? Hey.

252
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:28,481
Hey, stop. What are you doing?

253
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,860
You're really great.

254
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:33,653
What is going on?

255
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,197
The Continental Magic Association

256
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:40,410
asked us to get rid of
a fresser that's been ruining the crops.

257
00:18:40,493 --> 00:18:42,037
So I'm looking for a vanguard.

258
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,581
We met during the exam, right?

259
00:18:44,664 --> 00:18:47,125
Is he your friend? Can I borrow him?

260
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,252
-Go ahead.
-How ruthless!

261
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,007
-So ruthless…
-They're taking him away. Is that okay?

262
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:55,842
I'm sure it's fine.

263
00:18:55,925 --> 00:18:58,178
I didn't sense any malicious intent.

264
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:00,472
I almost didn't recognize him.

265
00:19:00,555 --> 00:19:03,850
He must be the type who changes
once he's in "work mode."

266
00:19:03,933 --> 00:19:05,560
My brothers are the same way.

267
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:11,024
Here, Frieren. This is a thank you gift.

268
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:15,945
I didn't do anything to deserve this.

269
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,824
No, if we didn't have you,

270
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,827
we wouldn't have made it
to the second stage.

271
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:23,995
Thank you.

272
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,665
Thank you,

273
00:19:28,374 --> 00:19:29,709
Master Himmel!

274
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:33,880
-There's no need to worry anymore.
-Okay.

275
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:36,674
Well then, don't keep
your mom and dad waiting.

276
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,842
Okay!

277
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,768
Why do you help people, Himmel?

278
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,187
Because I'm a hero.

279
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,897
That's not what I mean.

280
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,776
Well…

281
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:58,029
I might be doing it for myself.

282
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:00,698
Maybe it's because I want

283
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,910
to be remembered by others,
even if it's just a little.

284
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:13,044
Being alive means being known
and remembered by someone.

285
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:17,924
What can you do to be remembered?

286
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:24,514
Even if it's very subtle,
just try to change someone's life.

287
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,433
I'm sure that's all it takes.

288
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:39,863
And that's when Lawine…

289
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:43,449
No, that was you, Kanne.

290
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,285
Oh, was it?

291
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:47,370
Remember that other time?

292
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:48,705
That's right!

293
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,918
Mistress Frieren, these snacks
that they brought are so good.

294
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,712
She's finally in a good mood.

295
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,173
That reminds me…

296
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,508
You took forever to wake up
on the second day.

297
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,512
Don't bring that topic up.
She'll get mad again.

298
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,097
Pout…

299
00:21:06,764 --> 00:21:07,807
Frieren,

300
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,645
if they're doing it like usual,
the exam will go to a third stage.

301
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,981
We'll be enemies from now on.

302
00:21:15,481 --> 00:21:16,691
Yeah.

303
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,285
What's this?

304
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:29,787
It's the notice for the next stage.

305
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:32,665
It has the venue, date and time,

306
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:36,002
and name of the proctor
for the second stage.

307
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:39,881
The proctor is Sense, huh?
We're out of luck…

308
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:42,592
We passed the first stage for nothing.

309
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:44,677
What do you mean?

310
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:49,766
Sense has been a proctor
four times in the past.

311
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,810
Each time, zero examinees passed.

312
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,218
This meat tastes great!

313
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:28,930
You're amazing!
I witnessed the quintessence of strength.

314
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,813
What a horrible exam.

315
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,941
You think so?

316
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,152
I am a pacifist.

317
00:22:45,738 --> 00:22:47,657
Unlike you, Genau.

318
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,751
<i>-Who knew we'd find this.</i>
<i>-Gargoyles!</i>

319
00:24:21,834 --> 00:24:22,710
<i>-It's a mimic.</i>
<i>-This is sick.</i>

320
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,420
<i>-That's not possible.</i>
<i>-It must be that.</i>

321
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,338
<i>A demon or monster.</i>

322
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:27,590
<i>-That will be very dangerous.</i>
<i>-Let's proceed with caution.</i>

323
00:24:27,673 --> 00:24:29,842
<i>"Conquering the Labyrinth."</i>
