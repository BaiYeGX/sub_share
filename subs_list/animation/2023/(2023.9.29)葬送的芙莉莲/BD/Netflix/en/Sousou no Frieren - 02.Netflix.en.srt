ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

2
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:33,926
Let's see… Long-range magic

3
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:38,597
is made by combining three factors
that are required of all mages.

4
00:01:39,348 --> 00:01:43,185
One is your supply of mana,
another is the power to shoot it,

5
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,271
and then the power to control it.

6
00:01:45,354 --> 00:01:47,314
You know this much, right?

7
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,607
Yes.

8
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,944
Earlier, your magic dispersed midway.

9
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:55,614
That indicates that you don't have enough
mana and shooting power.

10
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:59,326
That isn't something
you can resolve overnight.

11
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,664
Regardless of your talent,
you have to work on it over several years.

12
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:13,132
But it seems you have a strong ability
to control your mana.

13
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:15,551
People usually have a hard time with it,

14
00:02:15,634 --> 00:02:17,970
but I don't think
you have to worry about that.

15
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:20,723
Just take your time.

16
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,018
Okay.

17
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,674
How is Fern's training going?

18
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:41,095
In four years, she reached a level
that would normally take ten years.

19
00:03:41,178 --> 00:03:44,765
She's too engrossed in it.
It's not a very good thing.

20
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,269
Nowadays, she's cooped up
in the forest the whole time.

21
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,188
She must love magic for sure.

22
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,817
But she's still not even close
to becoming a full-fledged mage.

23
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:58,237
I'll finish deciphering
this grimoire before that.

24
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:00,823
Is that so…?

25
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,826
Hey, Heiter…

26
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,996
This grimoire probably--

27
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,125
Heiter?

28
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:21,302
Don't look like that.

29
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:25,764
It was a miracle that I was even able to
move normally up until now.

30
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,354
I'll hurry up and decipher the grimoire.

31
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,523
Thank you.

32
00:04:39,653 --> 00:04:41,405
Fern, put a pause on training.

33
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,284
Heiter collapsed. Go and stay by his side.

34
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:48,913
I still haven't pierced through the rock.

35
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:53,042
That's something you'll be able to do
one day for sure. Right now--

36
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,668
It can't be "one day"!

37
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,672
If I wait until that day,

38
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:01,425
Master Heiter will die.

39
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:06,889
He saved my life.

40
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:21,487
It would be a waste for you to die now.

41
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,323
A waste?

42
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,868
It's been quite a while now,

43
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:31,330
but I lost an old friend.

44
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:35,084
Unlike me, he was always so upstanding.

45
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:39,046
He was the kind of person
who could never ignore someone in need.

46
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:44,009
If he was still alive, instead of me,

47
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,345
he could've saved many people.

48
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:49,473
I am not like him,

49
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:52,935
so I planned to live
the rest of my life in peace.

50
00:05:53,435 --> 00:05:56,563
But one day, I realized something.

51
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:59,733
If I die like this,

52
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:03,320
everything he taught me about
courage, determination, and friendship,

53
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,864
and even our precious memories

54
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:09,243
might disappear from this world as well.

55
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:13,831
<i>If you also have</i>

56
00:06:13,914 --> 00:06:16,834
<i>precious memories,</i>

57
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,587
I believe it'd be a waste for you to die.

58
00:06:22,756 --> 00:06:24,508
Master Heiter was always worried

59
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:26,969
about dying and leaving me behind.

60
00:06:28,595 --> 00:06:31,056
He did what was right.

61
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,101
I don't want him to regret saving me.

62
00:06:34,935 --> 00:06:37,229
Whether I become
a mage or not doesn't matter.

63
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:39,982
Finding a way to survive on my own

64
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:41,859
is my way of repaying him.

65
00:06:42,484 --> 00:06:45,529
I want him to be glad that he saved me

66
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:47,322
and know that I'll be fine.

67
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:54,246
You remember everything
I taught you, right?

68
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:55,539
Yes.

69
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:57,374
Then do as you please.

70
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:02,022
There was nothing about spells
for resurrecting the dead or immortality.

71
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,066
Is that right?

72
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:05,109
You knew?

73
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:09,363
The fear of death is unfathomable.

74
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:13,992
If such a thing existed,
Ewig would've used it on himself.

75
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,661
Then why…?

76
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,331
How is Fern?

77
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,708
She's still rough around the edges,

78
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:25,421
but you can call her a fully-fledged mage.

79
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:30,467
Is that right. So I made it in time.

80
00:08:31,301 --> 00:08:34,930
She is no longer a burden is she, Frieren?

81
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,352
Will you take her along with you
on your travels?

82
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,355
Sorry, Heiter. I can't do that.

83
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,108
She'll just be a burden.

84
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:48,861
You tricked me, Heiter?

85
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:55,617
The fee for deciphering it
is in the desk drawer.

86
00:08:56,201 --> 00:08:58,871
Please leave by tonight.

87
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:00,622
What do you mean?

88
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,252
As you can see,
I don't have much time left.

89
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:12,885
I don't want her to go through
the experience of losing someone again.

90
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:17,639
Frieren, I leave Fern in your care.

91
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:22,644
Trying to act cool again, Heiter?

92
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:28,650
Fern has already been prepared
to say goodbye for a while now.

93
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,321
What you need to do before you die,

94
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,907
is give her a proper farewell

95
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,619
and make as many memories
with her as you can.

96
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,415
Frieren…

97
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:47,211
you really are such a kind girl.

98
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,556
Hey, why did you save Fern?

99
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:19,826
Himmel the Hero would have done so.

100
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:23,539
That's true.

101
00:10:37,177 --> 00:10:38,220
Well then,

102
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:41,598
I guess I'll do the same.

103
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,277
Thank you very much.

104
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,195
Because of you,

105
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:57,781
I was able to repay Master Heiter.

106
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,994
I was just tricked into it.

107
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,080
By this corrupt priest.

108
00:11:10,752 --> 00:11:12,254
Okay, let's go.

109
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,884
{\an8}IT DIDN'T HAVE TO BE MAGIC…

110
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:29,563
26 YEARS FROM THE DEATH OF HIMMEL THE HERO

111
00:11:29,646 --> 00:11:32,065
THE TURK REGION IN THE CENTRAL LANDS

112
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:35,944
That's enough, Fern.

113
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:37,529
We're done.

114
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,201
What a lifesaver.

115
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,204
This is the reward I promised.

116
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,250
They're all very unassuming tasks…

117
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,210
This is what being an adventurer is like.

118
00:11:52,794 --> 00:11:54,838
What was the reward?

119
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:56,256
A folk spell.

120
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,842
It's a spell that produces hot tea.

121
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,218
Let's test it out later.

122
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,265
<i>Last time was a spell that removes</i>
<i>rust from bronze statues.</i>

123
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:08,310
<i>Before that it was another spell.</i>

124
00:12:08,393 --> 00:12:10,520
<i>-For turning sweet grapes sour.</i>
-It's sour.

125
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,648
You keep collecting such strange spells.

126
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,900
It's my hobby.

127
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:19,529
Mistress Frieren,
you must really love magic.

128
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,157
To a moderate degree, just like you.

129
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:25,410
I think we're a little different.

130
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,413
We're the same.

131
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:33,293
Are you sure you want to accept my offer?

132
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,545
I'm just an herbalist,

133
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,298
so I don't think I can
teach you any new magic.

134
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,258
That's fine.

135
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,887
I'd be happy if you'd just tell me about
the vegetation of this region.

136
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:49,309
Here it is.

137
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:57,692
It's a statue of Himmel the Hero.

138
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,694
It's in terrible shape, isn't it?

139
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:03,448
There's only so much
an old lady like me can do on my own.

140
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,411
The people of the village
don't care anymore.

141
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,414
-Mom!
-Run!

142
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:34,020
<i>When our village was attacked by monsters,</i>

143
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,523
<i>Master Himmel fought for us</i>
<i>with all his might.</i>

144
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:39,985
Treating him like this is just too cruel.

145
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:41,945
No.

146
00:13:42,612 --> 00:13:44,489
He's getting what he deserves.

147
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,117
It's Himmel's fault for wanting fame.

148
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:52,122
He should've said no when
the villagers said they'd erect a statue.

149
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,624
Are you sure?

150
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,335
-Isn't this pose too handsome?
-Who cares…

151
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,837
<i>He spent 18 hours picking a pose.</i>

152
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,381
<i>-And he pissed off the artist.</i>
-I'm hungry!

153
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,511
In the end, he settled with
a ridiculously standard pose.

154
00:14:07,512 --> 00:14:09,264
What a strange story.

155
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:14,978
Now that I think about it, there was
an elf mage in the party of heroes.

156
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,648
Well then, let's clean it up.

157
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:24,154
What a lifesaver.

158
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,073
Magic is so amazing, isn't it?

159
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,409
There's not a speck of rust on the statue!

160
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,456
It needs a bit of color.

161
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:36,792
Maybe I'll plant some flowers later.

162
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:41,463
Mistress Frieren, you know the spell
to create a field of flowers, right?

163
00:14:41,546 --> 00:14:44,758
Yeah, maybe I'll plant
some random flowers…

164
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:50,931
{\an8}No, it should be Blue Moon Weeds.

165
00:14:51,431 --> 00:14:53,975
{\an8}What kind of flower is that?

166
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,436
{\an8}I don't know. I've never seen it before.

167
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,395
{\an8}Then why…

168
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:00,023
It grows in Himmel's hometown.

169
00:15:00,732 --> 00:15:03,318
But you can't recreate flowers
you've never seen.

170
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:11,660
Blue Moon Weed…

171
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,246
That name brings back memories.

172
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:18,041
A long time ago,

173
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:21,753
there used to be a colony of them
deep in that forest.

174
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:29,553
They don't grow around here anymore?

175
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,597
They've gone extinct.

176
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:37,060
I haven't heard of anyone spotting them
on this continent for decades.

177
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,187
I see.

178
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,776
Fern, let's go.

179
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,694
Okay.

180
00:15:50,323 --> 00:15:51,950
You hid something.

181
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:54,536
I won't get mad, so show me.

182
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:00,458
Seed rats?

183
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,168
They're pests that eat seeds.

184
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,170
I'll return them to the forest.

185
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,928
Okay, Fern, let's go search for
Blue Moon Weeds.

186
00:16:12,554 --> 00:16:14,055
Are you serious?

187
00:16:14,806 --> 00:16:17,475
Until just recently,
there was a colony of them--

188
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,894
That was decades ago.

189
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,146
It's still worth looking for.

190
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:24,482
If we find the real one and analyze it,

191
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,986
we'll acquire a spell
that grows Blue Moon Weeds.

192
00:16:28,945 --> 00:16:30,488
Is it for Master Himmel?

193
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,866
No.

194
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:34,701
It's probably for myself.

195
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,713
BLUE MOON WEED

196
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:31,466
Mistress Frieren,
it has been half a year since we began

197
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:33,218
searching for the Blue Moon Weed.

198
00:17:33,301 --> 00:17:34,970
Yes, it has.

199
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,472
It's about time we widened our search.

200
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,066
Oh,

201
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:50,735
it's rare to see you by yourself.

202
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:56,700
It's been quite a while
since you two came to this village.

203
00:17:57,575 --> 00:18:00,495
Did you find the Blue Moon Weed?

204
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,039
Do you think we will find it?

205
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,628
Mistress Frieren has
an abnormal obsession toward magic.

206
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:13,717
At this rate, she will keep searching
for years, maybe decades.

207
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:19,180
Mistress Frieren is a mage with the power
to help many people.

208
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,601
Spending time searching for something
that doesn't exist

209
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,228
is just unacceptable.

210
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,648
You're so young.

211
00:18:30,191 --> 00:18:33,403
Is my way of thinking wrong?

212
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,822
I don't think so.

213
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,911
But Ms. Frieren must think differently.

214
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,583
However,

215
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:49,544
she is much older than both of us,

216
00:18:49,627 --> 00:18:51,796
so if you tell her your honest feelings,

217
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,882
I'm sure she'll understand.

218
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,028
These seeds are of
a related species that were

219
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:16,738
stored for medicinal use.

220
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,534
How about we plant these
around Master Himmel's statue instead?

221
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:23,745
I understand, Fern.

222
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,372
Sorry to make you worry.

223
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:32,587
I'm not on my own anymore.

224
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,880
It's about time to stop.

225
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,883
I'll wrap things up in a little bit.

226
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,013
When you say "a little"
how many years is that?

227
00:19:42,597 --> 00:19:44,015
Just a little.

228
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,310
You really can't give up can you--

229
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,698
Let's follow it.

230
00:20:30,895 --> 00:20:31,771
Mistress Frieren,

231
00:20:32,605 --> 00:20:35,150
why do you collect spells?

232
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:38,278
-It's just a hobby.
-It doesn't seem that way.

233
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,281
It's really just a hobby.

234
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:45,869
Before, I used to be apathetic
and lived without purpose.

235
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,604
Gross…

236
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,699
There was an idiot who praised me
for the spells I collected.

237
00:21:25,408 --> 00:21:26,534
That's all.

238
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:30,413
That is a silly reason.

239
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,582
It is.

240
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:55,438
That's…

241
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:57,232
It's a petal.

242
00:21:58,107 --> 00:22:00,485
Apparently, seed rats hide their food

243
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:03,446
in a safe place, away from their enemies.

244
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,782
They're smart animals.

245
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,034
Not really.

246
00:22:08,701 --> 00:22:10,662
They hide them in so many places,

247
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:13,164
so they forget where they hid them.

248
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:18,795
Blue Moon Weeds?

249
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,965
It's a flower from my hometown.

250
00:22:22,048 --> 00:22:23,299
It's really beautiful.

251
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,928
Well, not as beautiful as me, though.

252
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:28,304
We should get going.

253
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:30,890
Frieren…

254
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:33,643
One day, I want to show you.

255
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,063
Yeah? Maybe someday.

256
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:49,909
I knew I'd find it,
but I didn't expect so many.

257
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,958
Sorry it took so long, Himmel.

258
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,841
Who knew you would actually find them?

259
00:23:05,466 --> 00:23:08,261
Now I can make
a spell for Blue Moon Weeds.

260
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:11,848
Why are you so committed to magic?

261
00:23:11,931 --> 00:23:13,599
I don't understand.

262
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,852
You should know.

263
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,856
You didn't give up
on becoming a mage yourself.

264
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,484
That's not true.

265
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,821
As long as I could
acquire the strength to live on my own,

266
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:28,114
it could've been anything.

267
00:23:29,365 --> 00:23:31,451
It didn't have to be magic.

268
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:35,121
But you chose magic.

269
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:48,885
That's true.

270
00:23:51,095 --> 00:23:52,722
Who would have thought

271
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:55,725
that I could see Blue Moon Weeds again?

272
00:23:56,392 --> 00:23:57,727
They're so beautiful.

273
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:00,980
Thank you, Ms. Frieren.

274
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,318
I'm sure this statue will not be
forgotten anymore.

275
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:09,072
I almost forgot…

276
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:11,449
There.

277
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,161
Oh my, how cute.

278
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:17,580
All right, let's go now.

279
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:51,382
<i>That's too powerful.</i>

280
00:25:51,465 --> 00:25:53,593
<i>Qual, the Elder Sage of Corruption.</i>

281
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:55,595
<i>Okay, let's practice it.</i>

282
00:25:55,678 --> 00:25:57,805
<i>Does this journey have a purpose?</i>

283
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:59,849
<i>"Killing magic."</i>

284
00:25:59,932 --> 00:26:00,808
