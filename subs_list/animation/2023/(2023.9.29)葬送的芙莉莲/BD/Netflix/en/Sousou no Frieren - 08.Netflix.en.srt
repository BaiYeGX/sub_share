1
00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:11,886
Who are you?
It's outside of visiting hours.

2
00:00:14,096 --> 00:00:16,390
I am Draht, a servant

3
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,018
and executioner of Aura the Guillotine.

4
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:21,437
I'm here to kill you.

5
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:26,025
I see. You're done playing diplomat?

6
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:27,902
It's just beginning.

7
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,784
Just to let you know, I'm strong.

8
00:00:35,993 --> 00:00:37,495
Stronger than me?

9
00:00:38,746 --> 00:00:40,623
Stronger than Aura the Guillotine.

10
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:46,712
-That's hard to believe.
-Why?

11
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,759
Because it's already over for you.

12
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,809
A wire made of mana, huh?
That's interesting magic.

13
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:03,896
You concentrated mana around your neck
and stopped it from slicing?

14
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:05,898
You're pretty calm.

15
00:01:06,565 --> 00:01:10,695
Any other mage would've been decapitated
without realizing a thing.

16
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:15,658
However, this wire is one of
the strongest among demon magic.

17
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:18,661
Human magic cannot do anything about it.

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,917
I will slice right through your mana.

19
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:29,463
I agree, I don't think I can do
anything about this wire.

20
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,009
He thinks he won with just this, huh?

21
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,554
This generation of demons is no good.

22
00:01:36,637 --> 00:01:38,973
They're inexperienced in actual combat.

23
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:45,938
She…

24
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:47,898
cut my arm!

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,943
You bitch--

26
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,658
Wait! Let's talk--

27
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:09,378
One down…

28
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:16,886
<i>If I report this assault to the Graf</i>
<i>and take care of the other two,</i>

29
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,930
<i>I'm sure I'll be granted amnesty.</i>

30
00:02:29,815 --> 00:02:31,984
The guard is dead…

31
00:02:33,652 --> 00:02:36,655
ORIGINAL STORY BY
KANEHITO YAMADA / TSUKASA ABE

32
00:04:10,374 --> 00:04:11,834
This is delicious.

33
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,505
Master told me that

34
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:20,509
a town with good food
is a peaceful, good town.

35
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:22,887
That probably applies here.

36
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,521
-Master Stark.
-You can't have this.

37
00:04:33,355 --> 00:04:34,899
Let's appeal directly

38
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:37,818
to Graf Granat and have him
release Mistress Frieren.

39
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:44,450
It's only a matter of time
until this town is harmed.

40
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:49,163
Let's get Mistress Frieren out of prison
and have her take down the demons.

41
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:53,959
I guess that's our only choice.

42
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:56,962
We're no match for them.

43
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:01,342
Especially that guy named Lügner.
He's ridiculously strong.

44
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,178
<i>He was only looking at Frieren.</i>

45
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:08,182
<i>Even though you and I</i>
<i>and the guards were around…</i>

46
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,102
<i>he was only looking at Frieren.</i>

47
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:17,316
Because to him, he can kill us anytime.

48
00:05:19,026 --> 00:05:21,278
My hands are still shaking.

49
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:30,246
See? It spilled
and now it looks like I wet myself.

50
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,748
That's how scary he is.

51
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:37,378
Hurry up and wipe yourself, please.
We have to go.

52
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,882
Lügner is going to be near the Graf.

53
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,343
It might lead to combat.

54
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:47,554
The party of heroes would still have gone.

55
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:55,854
You're right. If I shrink back now,

56
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,273
I won't be able to face my master.

57
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,359
Let's go!

58
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:02,987
You can have that handkerchief.

59
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:13,163
-What's wrong?
-It's making me weak at the knees.

60
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:21,088
I can't detect Draht's mana.

61
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,550
He must be dead.

62
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:28,804
What a fool. He let his guard down.

63
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,015
Let his guard down?

64
00:06:32,474 --> 00:06:35,519
We serve as Mistress Aura's right hand.

65
00:06:35,602 --> 00:06:37,229
We're executioners.

66
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,357
Do you think we'd die
just by letting our guard down?

67
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,862
Who is that mage?

68
00:06:50,951 --> 00:06:53,370
Sorry to make you wait.

69
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:58,876
The mage we captured escaped prison.

70
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,003
She cut off the guard's head.

71
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:03,297
That must be troublesome.

72
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,507
I will help in the search.

73
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,261
-Linie excels in mana detection--
-No, that's not necessary.

74
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,934
By the way,
you seem to be missing one person.

75
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,772
He's using the restroom.
He'll be back shortly.

76
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,107
Without asking a servant where it is?

77
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:29,740
Even I could tell that mage
is highly skilled.

78
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:32,910
Yet she was easily captured by the guards.

79
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:38,123
<i>She knows how serious of a crime</i>
<i>it is to kill a guard.</i>

80
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:42,378
Lord Lügner, I will ask you one more time.

81
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,426
Where is your companion?

82
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,896
My goodness…

83
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,696
That good-for-nothing Draht.

84
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:20,916
He ruined everything.

85
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,934
But strangely enough,

86
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:42,020
this blasted situation that leaves us

87
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,606
with no option but to use violence

88
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,985
brings me irresistible joy.

89
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:52,906
Graf Granat, what are "words"?

90
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,951
What makes it different from this sword?

91
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,789
No matter what you use,
the weak will always die.

92
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,711
Just like the owner of this sword.

93
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,839
Lügner!

94
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:21,310
In the end, we're nothing but beasts.

95
00:09:22,644 --> 00:09:25,189
Don't worry, I won't kill you.

96
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:32,070
You will help us remove
the defense barrier of this town.

97
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,620
We're almost at the Graf's mansion.

98
00:09:43,707 --> 00:09:45,209
Mistress Frieren?

99
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,839
Aren't you Mistress Frieren?

100
00:09:58,847 --> 00:10:00,849
Why are you here?

101
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,435
Don't tell me you escaped?

102
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,730
I had no choice.

103
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:11,318
While I was in prison,
some demon named Draht attacked me.

104
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,362
I defeated him, but…

105
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,116
demons become mana particles
and disappear when they die.

106
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,744
What about that?

107
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:24,122
He had killed the prison guard.

108
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:27,459
<i>All that was left at the scene</i>

109
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,170
<i>was a guard that was beheaded by magic</i>

110
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,381
<i>and me, a mage.</i>

111
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,008
How do you view this situation?

112
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,346
You'll be sentenced to death
for killing a guard.

113
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:43,517
Right? It's too much of a hassle
so I'll leave town.

114
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,851
Please wait.

115
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,980
The remaining demons will roam free.

116
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,857
Are you going to abandon this town?

117
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,486
You two can take them down.

118
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,114
Don't make it sound so easy.

119
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,617
We're no match for them.

120
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:03,745
You won't fight them
because they're strong?

121
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:08,875
Plus, I don't think

122
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,671
for a second that you two are
weaker than those demons.

123
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:19,678
Wait up! We'll fight them!

124
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:22,973
So please help us, at least!
I'm begging you!

125
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:26,852
Peek…

126
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,479
Wait, please!

127
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:33,734
-Please, Frieren!
-Don't be stubborn.

128
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:36,987
-Let's face reality.
-No way…

129
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,949
-It's impossible.
-Stop whining.

130
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,795
About ten kilometers from town,
I'm guessing.

131
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,839
That's an immense amount of mana.

132
00:11:55,922 --> 00:11:58,383
Waiting to see our next move, huh?

133
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:20,155
<i>Aura the Guillotine,</i>
<i>one of the Seven Sages of Destruction.</i>

134
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:25,494
I hate fighting
strong opponents too, you know.

135
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,958
It's best to get your least favorite tasks
over with first.

136
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:24,052
Is it okay

137
00:13:24,928 --> 00:13:26,721
that we're sneaking in like this?

138
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,185
Do you want to tell the gatekeeper that
we're here to kill the messenger of peace?

139
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,037
It's eerily quiet.

140
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,799
I love magic.

141
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,220
<i>The famous Elder Sage of Corruption, Qual…</i>

142
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:10,724
<i>Just as he spent most of his life</i>

143
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:13,477
<i>developing a spell to kill humans…</i>

144
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,942
Within our long lifespan, we, demons,

145
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,613
dedicate our entire lives
to researching one kind of magic.

146
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:29,201
Over a long period of time,
we pursue it day after day.

147
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,623
In ten years,
our magic will be far superior to now

148
00:14:34,706 --> 00:14:37,834
and our power will be
even more unwavering.

149
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:46,134
However, magic can be very funny.

150
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,887
<i>Like the defense barrier,</i>

151
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,890
<i>which keeps demons out</i>
<i>and protects this town,</i>

152
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,768
<i>made by the Great Mage Flamme.</i>

153
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,920
<i>Magic that a genius created</i>
<i>a thousand years ago</i>

154
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:25,882
<i>can still surpass modern magic.</i>

155
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,762
I hate geniuses.

156
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:34,224
They lack the beauty
of accumulated effort.

157
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,104
The management of the barrier
has been passed down

158
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,022
through the Granat family.

159
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:46,027
The fact that demons like us
were able to enter the town

160
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:49,656
means that there must be a spell
that controls the barrier.

161
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,659
Tell me what that is.

162
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:00,000
Maybe I'll give you some time.

163
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,379
Think hard about it.

164
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,257
Making people wait is an effective

165
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,260
diplomatic strategy among humans, right?

166
00:16:11,386 --> 00:16:15,724
If you don't tell us,
all that awaits you is more torture.

167
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,945
There must be a grimoire
about barriers somewhere.

168
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:32,490
Check the bedroom. I'll search the study.

169
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:49,507
Oh, you're the adventurer brat
from this afternoon.

170
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:52,677
I thought my son came
to take me to the afterlife.

171
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,972
You're in horrible shape.
They would go this far?

172
00:16:58,099 --> 00:16:59,601
I'll get you out right away.

173
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,817
-You're trembling.
-Do you have a problem?

174
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:10,487
No, you're courageous.

175
00:17:11,571 --> 00:17:14,491
My dead son was trembling
before he went to battle too.

176
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,167
Damn! I can't cut the rope.
Is it magic or what?

177
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,835
Forget about me.

178
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,421
I won't make it anyway.

179
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:31,925
More than that,
get the townspeople to evacuate.

180
00:17:32,008 --> 00:17:36,262
None of them will listen to us
if you're not there anyway.

181
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:40,266
The Granat family's emblem
is around my neck.

182
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,689
If you show this to the guards,
they will listen to whatever you say.

183
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:48,483
One more thing, you brat.

184
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,654
Using informal speech with me
is a serious crime in this town.

185
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:02,914
That's right. If you go now,
I'll let you off the hook.

186
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,584
-Hurry up and go.
-Is that right.

187
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,670
Sorry, old man.

188
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:12,549
I'm going to break this fancy chair.

189
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,845
I can't pay for damages though!

190
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,473
Master Lügner, there's a rat.

191
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:26,021
Graf Granat, is he an acquaintance?

192
00:18:26,104 --> 00:18:29,899
No, he's one of the adventurers
from this afternoon.

193
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,194
He probably came to negotiate with me
not knowing

194
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,905
that his comrade already escaped prison.

195
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,658
What a dumb kid.

196
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:40,660
I see.

197
00:18:41,661 --> 00:18:42,662
<i>Again…</i>

198
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:45,165
You may leave, kid.

199
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,418
-I'll let you off the hook.
<i>-There it is again.</i>

200
00:18:50,628 --> 00:18:53,089
<i>He won't even look at me.</i>

201
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,718
What's wrong? Move out of the way.

202
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,137
If you get in my way, I'll kill you.

203
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:04,809
Try it then.

204
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:09,481
<i>He's fast.</i>

205
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,277
But he's just a human after all.

206
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:26,998
You guarded your vitals, huh?

207
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:29,459
Your reflexes aren't bad.

208
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:33,463
But I guess all youths are rash
no matter if you're a demon or human.

209
00:19:33,546 --> 00:19:35,256
You're thoughtless and reckless.

210
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:41,471
However, I will acknowledge your valor
for standing up against me alone.

211
00:19:42,263 --> 00:19:43,473
Alone?

212
00:19:43,556 --> 00:19:47,936
I see… So you really can't see, huh?

213
00:19:48,019 --> 00:19:48,978
Excuse me?

214
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,816
Fern, I created an opening
just as you ordered.

215
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,319
Master Lügner, I detect a mage.

216
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,754
<i>That can't be…</i>
<i>A mere human mage was able to</i>

217
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:18,133
<i>get past Linie's mana detection unnoticed?</i>

218
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:22,262
<i>And this spell is…</i>

219
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,518
-Master Lügner, I will handle this.
-Stop.

220
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,438
Girl, what is this spell?

221
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,899
Ordinary offensive magic.

222
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,236
If I remember correctly,
in your framework of magic

223
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,363
it is called Zoltraak.

224
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,866
You call this Zoltraak?

225
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,160
Don't be ridiculous.

226
00:20:45,243 --> 00:20:49,914
Us demons overcame Zoltraak
more than half a century ago.

227
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:53,501
Who taught you this spell?

228
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,546
You're just buying time, aren't you?

229
00:20:57,255 --> 00:20:58,256
I will finish you off.

230
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,466
I won't let you.

231
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:04,220
Fern!

232
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,973
The Graf's injuries are severe.

233
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:09,475
We don't have time to fight.
Let's retreat.

234
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:11,895
Yes.

235
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:26,117
As soon as I stop bleeding,
we'll go after them. You take the warrior.

236
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:32,123
<i>My blood is on both of them.</i>

237
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,626
<i>I won't lose track of them.</i>

238
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:38,004
There's no need for you
to kill them yourself, Master Lügner.

239
00:21:38,087 --> 00:21:40,548
I'll take care of the mage too.

240
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,010
If you were hit by her magic
you would have died.

241
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:52,268
That spell was modified to
specialize in killing demons.

242
00:21:52,852 --> 00:21:56,856
You cannot call it Zoltraak anymore.

243
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,527
It's a spell to kill demons.

244
00:22:02,445 --> 00:22:05,573
<i>That girl's movements seemed familiar.</i>

245
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:10,286
<i>I have been hit by that same spell before.</i>

246
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,257
<i>I see…</i>

247
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:25,343
I remember now.

248
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,137
It's Frieren.

249
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:34,727
<i>She greatly helped humans in their</i>
<i>research and analysis of Zoltraak.</i>

250
00:22:35,311 --> 00:22:40,274
<i>The mage who has killed</i>
<i>the most demons in all history.</i>

251
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,320
<i>Frieren the Slayer.</i>

252
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,784
<i>Another genius that I hate.</i>

253
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,834
<i>Master Lügner is going to be mad.</i>

254
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,252
<i>This is crazy.</i>

255
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,797
<i>-Any demon can do it.</i>
<i>-I am at an advantage.</i>

256
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,881
<i>Let's try together.</i>

257
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:29,759
<i>"Aura the Guillotine."</i>

258
00:24:29,842 --> 00:24:30,802
