1
00:00:01,585 --> 00:00:03,306
Just relax here for now.

2
00:00:03,973 --> 00:00:06,659
Although actually,
this is not my house.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,078
Let me prepare you some snacks.

4
00:00:09,229 --> 00:00:10,940
Nice! Snacks!

5
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:13,025
I'm grateful for your
consideration but...

6
00:00:13,026 --> 00:00:15,276
We don't really have time
to take it easy, right?

7
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,821
Let's listen to your story.

8
00:00:19,066 --> 00:00:20,658
Quite assertive, aren't you?

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,743
As expected from His Majesty,
Sion Sol Sunkland.

10
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:25,453
Sion?!

11
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:28,331
The prince of Sunkland Kingdom?!

12
00:00:28,873 --> 00:00:30,125
So you noticed...

13
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:31,584
Of course.

14
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:37,341
If not, I wouldn't have guided
you around with that sword.

15
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:38,758
So,

16
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:44,097
Why are you guiding us, even though
you're told that we might get in your way?

17
00:00:44,722 --> 00:00:47,642
We are expecting reinforcement
from your country.

18
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,936
I'd like you not to
take it so lightly.

19
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:53,106
Moving an army
is a big event for a country.

20
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:58,863
Befitting words for Your Highness
Sion, who values justice and fairness.

21
00:00:58,864 --> 00:01:01,699
Even if we support you,

22
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,785
I don't think you can guarantee that
you'll be able to resist until then.

23
00:01:06,353 --> 00:01:10,999
This place is right between the capital
and Count Donovan's territory...

24
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:12,333
In other words...

25
00:01:13,168 --> 00:01:16,563
You're trying to divide the Diamond Legion
from the capital.

26
00:01:16,963 --> 00:01:18,798
So you're going to hit
their supply lines.

27
00:01:21,217 --> 00:01:23,679
Even though they're
separated from the capital,

28
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,666
if it's within their territory,

29
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:28,349
they can resupply
from their surroundings.

30
00:01:28,933 --> 00:01:31,478
But, they'll still need
time to arrange it.

31
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:35,857
There will still be temporary chaos
and confusion among the ranks...

32
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:41,237
If he already predicted it before
causing a disturbance in this city...

33
00:01:42,155 --> 00:01:44,324
He's not someone I
can underestimate.

34
00:01:44,782 --> 00:01:48,913
Sion raised his caution
against Lambert.

35
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:51,749
And on the other hand, Mia is...

36
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,045
This cookie!

37
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:58,923
Such detailed craftsmanship,
and it's delicious to top it off!

38
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:00,715
This person...

39
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:04,470
He's not half bad,
not someone I can make light of!

40
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:10,225
Miraculously, their evaluation
matched with each other.

41
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:13,300
<i>A goddess! A saint!
Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

42
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,594
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

43
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:18,264
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

44
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:21,625
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

45
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:23,626
<i>I am!</i>

46
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,859
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going
through as a helpless princess</i>

47
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,318
<i>If that's what you thought,
then go ahead!?</i>

48
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,070
<i>The world is always dependent
on the direction of wind</i>

49
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,740
<i>There are too many useless
things and people, seriously</i>

50
00:02:36,741 --> 00:02:39,450
<i>I can't believe in anybody</i>

51
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,161
<i>I have noticed that, the world is</i>

52
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,874
<i>so heartless</i>

53
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,375
<i>That is not good,
This is not good</i>

54
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:47,543
<i>It is not good,
everything is not good</i>

55
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:49,145
<i>The reality is harsh</i>

56
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:51,255
<i>Alteration... alteration... alteration...</i>

57
00:02:51,256 --> 00:02:54,090
<i>Everything is going to be altered...!</i>

58
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,869
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

59
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,097
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

60
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:02,266
<i>Even in a sad scenario</i>

61
00:03:02,267 --> 00:03:05,503
<i>I am going to rewrite
everything, everything</i>

62
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:08,021
<i>Because, because,
I am a princess</i>

63
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,232
<i>At least of my own story</i>

64
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,443
<i>I must enjoy it as much as possible</i>

65
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,530
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

66
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:18,908
<i>I have to live with
all my strength</i>

67
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:22,118
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

68
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,411
<i>Just wait and see!</i>

69
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:28,067
<i>I shall alter my own destiny!</i>

70
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:36,200
<i>A goddess! A saint! Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

71
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:38,785
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

72
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:45,192
Remno Kingdom has something they can truly
take pride in, compared to other kingdoms.

73
00:03:45,193 --> 00:03:48,961
That is a wide national highway
that's fully guarded,

74
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:53,506
And highly mobile rapid response
troops that take advantage of it.

75
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,136
(Reunion, A Duel, And...)
If they reinforce it even more...

76
00:03:59,888 --> 00:04:02,807
An army that is planning to do
an invasion of other countries...

77
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:06,436
So that's what the people
were heavily taxed for.

78
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,734
But, the royals of this country
dispatched the Diamond Legion,

79
00:04:11,736 --> 00:04:15,571
the overpowered troop
just to oppress its own people.

80
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:20,658
There may be various circumstances...

81
00:04:21,116 --> 00:04:23,203
But not only did they impose
heavy taxes on the people,

82
00:04:23,205 --> 00:04:26,165
they also imprisoned the retainer
that stands for them.

83
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:30,251
Doesn't that disqualify them
to lead the country?

84
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:34,964
I was just planning to
accompany Princess Mia, but...

85
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:47,560
I almost got caught up by it...

86
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:52,517
Jem said we have to turn
Prince Sion into our ally,

87
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:57,597
but Princess Mia might become
a hindrance to the revolution.

88
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:04,285
I have to silence
Princess Mia somehow...

89
00:05:06,454 --> 00:05:09,165
A lot has happened today,
so I bet you're exhausted, right?

90
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:11,626
If it's fine with you,
you can stay here for a night.

91
00:05:12,126 --> 00:05:13,963
I can't say it's comparable
to the royal palace,

92
00:05:13,964 --> 00:05:16,047
but we have a big bath and bed here.

93
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:18,675
Whoa! Bath!

94
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:21,011
In the end, she's just a kid...

95
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:23,556
Seems like it's going to be
easy to drive her around.

96
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:26,266
Quite the over-optimistic
calculation, but true.

97
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:30,979
Aren't you being too careless
about this, Princess Mia?

98
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:33,690
Who knows?
What are you talking about?

99
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:38,338
If they're aiming for
the Sunkland troops,

100
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,216
I'm sure they won't harm you, but...

101
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:44,993
Even so, staying here
for a night is a bit...

102
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:47,971
What's wrong, Princess Mia?

103
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:54,794
For a Remno Kingdom product,
it's not lathering nicely.

104
00:05:55,128 --> 00:05:59,966
As I thought, the one I got from
Prince Abel was special.

105
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:04,179
You really are the Empire's Princess.

106
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,931
By the way,
what kind of shampoo were you using?

107
00:06:07,307 --> 00:06:09,642
I can't remember the name, but...

108
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:13,354
It has pictures of
cute horses on it!

109
00:06:15,269 --> 00:06:16,917
That's...

110
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,252
It's a really good shampoo!

111
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,614
Ah... I... See...

112
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:25,200
That's... Great... I guess?

113
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:27,952
Lynsha managed to read the room.

114
00:06:31,436 --> 00:06:34,810
The mushroom stew is great...!

115
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:37,795
Sir Lambert! This is bad!

116
00:06:41,674 --> 00:06:44,677
To think that it
developed this quickly...

117
00:06:46,387 --> 00:06:48,807
Did something happen?

118
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,477
There's a report from
my collaborators.

119
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,808
The royal forces have been dispatched
to fortresses along the road.

120
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:56,648
Royal forces...

121
00:06:58,107 --> 00:06:59,609
The one who leads it is...

122
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,861
The second prince, Abel Remno!

123
00:07:02,195 --> 00:07:04,405
Whoa! Prince Abel!

124
00:07:04,739 --> 00:07:08,409
Thank God I got into
the bath yesterday!

125
00:07:09,661 --> 00:07:13,089
The only reason a royal
would lead an army by themselves

126
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:16,543
is to rouse the
deployed Diamond Legion.

127
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,589
Is that the path that you
chose, Prince Abel?

128
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,220
Mia. Don't you want to go?

129
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:30,223
Yeah, But...

130
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,309
Well, even if you don't, I will...

131
00:07:33,935 --> 00:07:38,607
But I see, maybe it's easier
if you don't come with me...

132
00:07:39,774 --> 00:07:40,858
Why?

133
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:44,028
I have something
I must ask Prince Abel.

134
00:07:44,988 --> 00:07:46,155
Depending on his answer...

135
00:07:46,858 --> 00:07:51,661
I might have to carry out the thing
that you asked me for that night.

136
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,417
I...

137
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:02,255
I can't just stay still while
people are being massacred...

138
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:07,385
Are you going to
kill Prince Abel?

139
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:10,555
I hope it won't end that way...

140
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:13,808
I don't want Prince Abel to die...

141
00:08:14,183 --> 00:08:16,477
And of course,
Prince Sion too...

142
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:22,191
More than anything, I don't want them to
kill each other without me knowing it!

143
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:26,821
Prince Sion...

144
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,991
I'll...

145
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:32,952
I'll also go with chu!

146
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:36,956
Mia bit her tongue.

147
00:08:40,668 --> 00:08:45,089
Hey, isn't it about time
you cooperate with us?

148
00:08:47,383 --> 00:08:54,223
I don't think His Majesty
made any fatal mistake, Jem!

149
00:08:55,016 --> 00:09:00,396
I just have to keep advising him
until he's willing to listen to me.

150
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:05,818
I'm not that young to fall into
temptations from suspicious guys like you.

151
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,324
Prince, what should we do?

152
00:09:11,824 --> 00:09:15,161
I don't think we need
to give them more time.

153
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:18,615
Fortunatly,
the walls of Senia are low,

154
00:09:18,617 --> 00:09:22,044
and the barricades
they made are weak.

155
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,004
It won't be hard to break in.

156
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:31,010
The duty as a prince...

157
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:34,181
Report!
There were movements in the city!

158
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:35,974
Did they send a messenger?

159
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:39,118
No, but there are two kids

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,563
and they demand to meet Prince Abel.

161
00:09:41,564 --> 00:09:42,898
Fools...

162
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,317
Members of the revolt want
to meet Prince Abel?

163
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:47,861
The thing is...

164
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:52,573
They're not ordinary kids, they said
they're Prince Abel's school friends...

165
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:54,262
Excuse me.

166
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:58,580
Prince Sion!

167
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:00,040
Why are you here?

168
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,997
No, wait... That means...

169
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:10,925
Long time no see, Prince Abel.

170
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:12,301
Princess Mia!

171
00:10:13,136 --> 00:10:16,556
I'd be really happy if you
were here just to see me, but...

172
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:21,644
Well, Is there any other
reason why I'd be here?

173
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:26,357
Maybe it's true that she
came here to see me...

174
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:32,572
But more than that, I'm sure she
wants to stop this stupid conflict.

175
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:37,952
I'm sure Princess Mia
won't take my side on this...

176
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:40,705
But even so... I...

177
00:10:41,998 --> 00:10:44,834
Prince Sion, How about you?

178
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,514
I don't think you're like Princess Mia,

179
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:53,886
who comes here just to see me, right?

180
00:10:53,887 --> 00:10:58,973
Yeah, I was only planning to act as
a bodyguard for Princess Mia, but...

181
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:02,059
Now that it comes to this,
I can't just stay silent.

182
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:06,522
It's a bit earlier than
what I expected, but...

183
00:11:07,023 --> 00:11:11,194
The rematch you promised
before summer, let's do it now.

184
00:11:14,155 --> 00:11:15,531
That means...

185
00:11:15,823 --> 00:11:18,743
You're challenging me to a duel?

186
00:11:18,993 --> 00:11:20,995
You don't need to listen to him.

187
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:25,705
Prince Abel, as a commander of a troop,
there's no need for you to do a duel.

188
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,545
Stand down, Bernard.

189
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:32,757
The Prince of Sunkland himself
asked for a duel of life and death

190
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:35,514
for the sake of
the justice he believed in.

191
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:40,348
If I refuse it,
it would demoralize the soldiers.

192
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:45,186
Besides, I can't back down
in front of her.

193
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,441
Prince Sion,
I accept your challenge.

194
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:51,818
What?

195
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,670
That's weird...

196
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,073
I said it, right?

197
00:11:56,074 --> 00:11:58,992
That I'm here to see him...

198
00:11:58,993 --> 00:12:02,596
In stories, situations
like this are a bit more...

199
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:05,704
Like, he'll hug me,
the mood changes for the better,

200
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:10,379
then everything is resolved, no?

201
00:12:14,182 --> 00:12:17,394
Bernard,
Here's an order specifically for you.

202
00:12:17,894 --> 00:12:21,274
Stay beside Princess Mia
from the Empire, and protect her.

203
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:22,858
Prince Abel!

204
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:29,907
The princess will testify that the duel
between me and Prince Sion is legitimate.

205
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:32,451
No! You shouldn't fight!

206
00:12:32,617 --> 00:12:36,330
I wanted to enjoy this reunion
with you in another way...

207
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,165
A better way...

208
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:44,229
Quite pitiful of me...

209
00:12:44,504 --> 00:12:46,506
Prince Abel!

210
00:12:49,843 --> 00:12:52,012
Even Mia's words
can't reach you?

211
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:56,558
No matter who stands in my way,
I can't stop.

212
00:12:56,933 --> 00:12:59,061
I'm sure you understand it too.

213
00:12:59,895 --> 00:13:02,689
Sacrificing yourself for
a rotten regal rule...

214
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:05,901
But that's more the reason
why regal rule is needed.

215
00:13:06,443 --> 00:13:10,864
In a world of anarchy,
a lot more people will suffer.

216
00:13:11,531 --> 00:13:17,204
If the government has become
corrupt, then it's my role to fix it.

217
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:25,003
If you join in on
oppressing the people...

218
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:28,090
Then my sword will cut you down.

219
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:49,277
What power even though
he's not in perfect stance!

220
00:13:52,489 --> 00:13:57,369
So I'm not the only one who's
training hard for our rematch.

221
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:00,288
I'm trying to surpass you, a genius.

222
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:03,250
I have to put more
spirit into it.

223
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:08,861
Who are you people?

224
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:25,148
He's messing with my timing
by moving closer instead.

225
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:27,566
Nice one, Abel Remno!

226
00:14:27,774 --> 00:14:31,779
You too...
As expected from you, Prince Sion.

227
00:14:40,968 --> 00:14:42,455
Amazing...

228
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:45,392
The strength of his
slashes is increasing.

229
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,753
Is he adjusting it as we fight?

230
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:51,298
Can't expect less from
the sword genius...

231
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:55,695
I can't last any longer...

232
00:14:55,696 --> 00:14:56,761
But...

233
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,074
I can't show her my pitiful side!

234
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:04,186
On your stance, Prince Sion.

235
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,313
This will be our last battle!

236
00:15:11,943 --> 00:15:14,197
Please stop it already!

237
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:17,616
You two will actually die!

238
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:28,668
So in the end,
my words can't reach them at all...

239
00:15:29,085 --> 00:15:29,837
Go away!

240
00:15:29,838 --> 00:15:30,646
You idiot!

241
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:34,984
Everyone! Please listen to me!

242
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,931
It's just like that time...

243
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,478
In front of the two with swords who
have determined themselves for a fight,

244
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,896
words are meaningless.

245
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:51,067
Sion... Prince Abel...

246
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:52,485
Really?

247
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,238
Please! Please!

248
00:15:55,922 --> 00:16:00,868
Is Mia's voice, wish,
really not reaching them?

249
00:16:01,243 --> 00:16:02,284
No!

250
00:16:02,285 --> 00:16:03,703
Please don't die!

251
00:16:04,246 --> 00:16:05,705
That's not true!

252
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:10,419
Even if her voice didn't reach the two
princes who were focused on the battle...

253
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,815
The bond that she has built,
will deliver it.

254
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:18,385
But who will it be?

255
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:25,600
It's the reliable loyal
retainers that she has.

256
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,022
This is troubling.

257
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:41,533
Aren't you guys a bit too
rowdy, my dear princes?

258
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:44,837
Our Princess is a crybaby,

259
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,582
so can you try not to
make her cry so much?

260
00:16:47,859 --> 00:16:49,127
Dion...

261
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:50,458
You!

262
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:54,838
How boorish of you to stop
a sacred battle between royals!

263
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:57,966
Well, that's kinda true.

264
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:01,345
Even though the retainer of the prince
who's risking his life is holding back,

265
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:03,763
I came and crashed in
out of nowhere.

266
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:09,270
But you see, my sword doesn't
belong to any of these princes.

267
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:12,772
Shut up! You'll pay for
that insolence with death!

268
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:26,411
To think that you can
cut through steel...

269
00:17:27,543 --> 00:17:31,041
After all, it's in front of my lady,
I have to show this much.

270
00:17:34,336 --> 00:17:36,796
You two, stop at once!

271
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:40,383
Anne!

272
00:17:41,152 --> 00:17:44,196
Miss Mia...
I'm glad you're okay...

273
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,644
Anne...

274
00:17:49,645 --> 00:17:50,686
Anne...

275
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:52,438
Anne...

276
00:17:53,063 --> 00:17:54,189
Know your place!

277
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:56,279
You're in front of Her Majesty,
Princess Mia!

278
00:17:56,564 --> 00:17:58,943
Both of you,
put down your weapon!

279
00:18:00,643 --> 00:18:05,283
An exquisite and skillful
order from Ludwig.

280
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:09,538
Dion, who managed to overpower
a strong knight like Bernard,

281
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,249
followed his order and
sheathed his sword.

282
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:17,837
By effect, the initiative
completely rolled towards Mia now.

283
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:23,301
Why is everyone looking at me?

284
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,474
From here on, it's your time
to shine, Princess Mia...

285
00:18:29,307 --> 00:18:33,103
They're expecting
a speech from me?!

286
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,065
We're here with you...

287
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,441
Is that how it is?!

288
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:44,614
It... It feels kinda scary!

289
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,751
Everyone, please listen to me!

290
00:18:57,293 --> 00:19:00,547
My name is Mia Luna Tearmun....

291
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:05,343
Mia bit her tongue again.

292
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,807
Her eyes became
watery from the pain.

293
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:13,727
She caught the soldiers' hearts with that!

294
00:19:14,018 --> 00:19:15,903
I don't want to
do this anymore!!

295
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,164
Miss Mia, you can do it!

296
00:19:18,481 --> 00:19:22,737
Wait, in the first place,
what should I talk about?

297
00:19:22,738 --> 00:19:25,948
Mia doesn't have a plan to
stop the Remno Kingdom army.

298
00:19:25,949 --> 00:19:31,287
In the first place,
Mia came here just to meet with Abel.

299
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:34,789
What should I do?!

300
00:19:35,496 --> 00:19:36,848
Well, in any case...

301
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,709
I have to say something!

302
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:51,221
I'd like the Remno Kingdom army,
to return without pulling out your swords!

303
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:52,349
That's ridiculous!

304
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,604
You're telling us to go back without
doing anything to the rebels?!

305
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,815
This person is scary!

306
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:05,528
Due to Bernard's pressure,
Mia's head is finally starting to work.

307
00:20:05,994 --> 00:20:08,699
It's totally ridiculous, after all!

308
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,909
For you guys to go into battle...

309
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:17,917
The enemy is just a ragtag army, not an
opponent for chivalrous knights like you!

310
00:20:17,918 --> 00:20:23,463
That's how Mia gave her all
to butter up to them, but...

311
00:20:23,838 --> 00:20:25,215
Ridiculous, huh...

312
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,178
You did say a while back that
something is bothering you.

313
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:32,388
Like, you feel that
something is strange.

314
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:35,475
That's right!
I did say something like that!

315
00:20:36,142 --> 00:20:39,438
I mean, the situations
between the Remno Kingdom

316
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:43,900
and the past Tearmoon Empire
are completely different after all.

317
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:49,697
Yet, Outland Count Rudolvon and
Prime Minister Dasayev Donovan,

318
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:53,744
the nobles who sided with the people
were harmed, and it sparked the rebellion.

319
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:55,471
And in both cases,

320
00:20:55,472 --> 00:20:59,791
the one who saved the people from
oppression was the Sunkland Kingdom.

321
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:04,463
Such a coincidence can happen even
though the situations are different?

322
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,422
There's no way that's possible!

323
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:13,346
It's like someone is trying to usher the
Sunkland Kingdom as a bringer of justice!

324
00:21:14,108 --> 00:21:18,726
This seems like a
truly cunning scheme...

325
00:21:19,686 --> 00:21:20,688
But...

326
00:21:20,689 --> 00:21:23,314
How can I explain it?

327
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:26,485
I can't just blabber about
the previous timeline...

328
00:21:29,313 --> 00:21:31,155
A cunning scheme...

329
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:35,327
Princess, you think that this rebellion
is connected to someone else,

330
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:38,247
and they're doing it
to divide the country.

331
00:21:38,248 --> 00:21:40,053
We're dancing on
the palm of his hands,

332
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:43,502
and people of the same country
killing each other is ridiculous.

333
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:45,295
Is that what you're
trying to say?

334
00:21:48,381 --> 00:21:53,185
Is that also the reason why Prince Sion
put himself fought to stop Prince Abel?

335
00:21:53,511 --> 00:21:54,780
No, I just...

336
00:21:55,586 --> 00:21:59,563
You're here to protect me,

337
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:04,415
so if my goal is to stop
that cunning scheme,

338
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:08,127
at least you can say that half of
your motive is to do that, right?

339
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,820
You can say it, right?!

340
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:12,906
Well,
it's not like it's a lie too...

341
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:16,201
How about that?!

342
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,202
Did I manage to
bluff my way out?!

343
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:22,957
Unfortunately, Princess...

344
00:22:23,416 --> 00:22:26,378
Even if a mastermind
has planned all this,

345
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:32,258
we still have to disperse the rebels,
and bring back peace to this land...

346
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:37,932
If we don't lower down the tax,

347
00:22:37,933 --> 00:22:41,392
I don't think
they'll lower their arms just like that...

348
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,520
That's not true!

349
00:22:44,687 --> 00:22:49,275
What the rebels are demanding
is the release of Sir Donovan!

350
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:56,742
Prince Abel, have you heard anything about
Count Donovan being thrown into jail?

351
00:22:56,743 --> 00:22:59,036
No, It's my first time hearing it...

352
00:22:59,263 --> 00:23:05,124
Princess Mia, I'm sure you have an
inkling of where he's being kept,

353
00:23:05,959 --> 00:23:09,420
But, isn't there a possibility that
he might've been murdered already?

354
00:23:09,629 --> 00:23:12,006
Well, that's...

355
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:16,135
I think it's better if I
answer that question instead.

356
00:23:18,638 --> 00:23:20,723
Everyone,
sorry we took our time!

357
00:23:21,307 --> 00:23:22,850
Tiona!

358
00:23:23,226 --> 00:23:25,436
Keithwood, you're alright?!

359
00:23:25,812 --> 00:23:27,648
I brought you some good news!

360
00:23:28,398 --> 00:23:31,734
No, I think it's bad news
for us though...
