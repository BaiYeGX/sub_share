1
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:30,613
Kill them!

2
00:00:34,577 --> 00:00:36,894
Let go of me, you insolent fool!

3
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:42,000
Don't you dare think you will get
off easily after doing this to me!

4
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:45,170
Please someone cut
this person's head off!

5
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:46,171
Someone!

6
00:00:51,935 --> 00:00:52,995
What?!

7
00:00:55,446 --> 00:00:56,999
Wait!

8
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,685
I don't want to be
in this filthy place!

9
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:00,978
Let me out!!

10
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,838
I am telling you to let me out!!

11
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,508
I...

12
00:01:08,718 --> 00:01:09,928
I am...

13
00:01:09,929 --> 00:01:12,989
The First Princess of
the Tearmoon Empire,

14
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:17,702
Mia Luna Tearmoon...

15
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:23,416
(3 years later)

16
00:01:33,075 --> 00:01:34,869
I brought you food.

17
00:01:35,697 --> 00:01:39,957
It stinks as always,
makes me want to puke.

18
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:44,186
Wait, you have to
start with this first.

19
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,636
What a waste!

20
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:55,573
You happen to dislike these yellow
moon tomatoes, don't you, Princess?

21
00:01:55,973 --> 00:02:01,312
In any case, this your last meal.
Eat however you want.

22
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:20,139
Hey!

23
00:02:21,223 --> 00:02:23,017
Here's your last guest.

24
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:23,924
Come.

25
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:48,626
Now go!

26
00:02:55,645 --> 00:02:57,159
Why...

27
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:01,222
Why did it come to this?

28
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,587
Hurry up and kill her!

29
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:08,212
Kill that witch!

30
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,720
Why...this...

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,042
Why...

32
00:03:22,576 --> 00:03:24,520
Why...

33
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:49,962
No!

34
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:56,861
My neck!
Neck, neck, neck, neck!!

35
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,780
Oh! It's still there...

36
00:04:00,222 --> 00:04:02,767
My neck is fine...

37
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:18,783
I got younger...?

38
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:34,357
No way!

39
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:37,090
There's no way such a thing
can happen in real life.

40
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,907
What a boring dream.

41
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:45,601
It was so childish,
even I felt shocked by it...

42
00:04:47,526 --> 00:04:48,454
Huh?

43
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,822
It's almost the day
of my execution.

44
00:04:56,823 --> 00:04:58,865
I'm scared. I'm scared.
I don't wanna die.

45
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,409
What went wrong?

46
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,578
Is it because I laughed and told them
to eat meat if there's no bread?

47
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:05,626
No, no, no...

48
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:08,624
I don't wanna die,
I don't wanna...

49
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:12,978
Nooo!!

50
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,273
<i>A goddess! A saint! Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

51
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,567
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

52
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,237
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

53
00:05:21,239 --> 00:05:24,599
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

54
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
<i>I am!</i>

55
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,832
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going
through as a helpless princess</i>

56
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,291
<i>If that's what you thought,
then go ahead!?</i>

57
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,044
<i>The world is always dependent
on the direction of wind</i>

58
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:39,713
<i>There are too many useless
things and people, seriously</i>

59
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:42,424
<i>I can't believe in anybody</i>

60
00:05:42,424 --> 00:05:45,135
<i>I have noticed that, the world is</i>

61
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:47,847
<i>so heartless</i>

62
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:49,348
<i>That is not good,
This is not good</i>

63
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,516
<i>It is not good,
everything is not good</i>

64
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:52,119
<i>The reality is harsh</i>

65
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,228
<i>Alteration... alteration...alteration...</i>

66
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,064
<i>Everything is going to be altered...!</i>

67
00:05:57,064 --> 00:05:59,843
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

68
00:05:59,844 --> 00:06:03,070
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

69
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:05,239
<i>Even in a sad scenario</i>

70
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:08,477
<i>I am going to rewrite
everything, everything</i>

71
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:10,995
<i>Because, because,
I am a princess</i>

72
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,206
<i>At least of my own story</i>

73
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:16,417
<i>I must enjoy it as much as possible</i>

74
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:19,503
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

75
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,881
<i>I have to live with
all my strength</i>

76
00:06:21,883 --> 00:06:25,092
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

77
00:06:25,092 --> 00:06:26,385
<i>Just wait and see!</i>

78
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:31,041
<i>I shall alter my own destiny!</i>

79
00:06:36,456 --> 00:06:39,174
<i>A goddess! A saint! Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

80
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:41,759
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

81
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:48,157
My mood is still
not getting any better...

82
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,786
This never-changing
thrilling beauty...

83
00:06:53,478 --> 00:06:58,276
Without a doubt, it is a perfect palace
suitable for the royal family.

84
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:02,546
I'm sure that abomination I saw
earlier was nothing but a dream.

85
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:08,114
To think that I'm being
affected by a nightmare...

86
00:07:11,354 --> 00:07:14,583
That's it!
Let's get something to eat first!

87
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:21,487
I am sorry!
Did I make a mistake?

88
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:25,819
Princess Mia, did something happen?

89
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,530
This person...

90
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:33,870
Isn't he the head chef that I fired?

91
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:36,705
I think its few years
later from now...

92
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:41,461
He always served the vegetables that
I hate, so one day I got pissed and...

93
00:07:41,462 --> 00:07:42,753
You're fired!

94
00:07:44,415 --> 00:07:46,840
Is something wrong?

95
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,911
No, it's nothing.

96
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:54,349
If that's the case then please
enjoy your meal before it gets cold.

97
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,231
This is...

98
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:04,150
I am completely aware that
this is not to your liking,

99
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,671
but for Princess's
nutritional balance...

100
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:08,905
This is nostalgic!

101
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,965
Huh?

102
00:08:11,615 --> 00:08:14,868
I didn't like the sourness
of yellow moon tomatoes...

103
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:19,707
But somehow, this is...

104
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,156
Chef!

105
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:28,883
Yes!?

106
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:31,410
What in the world is this?!

107
00:08:31,869 --> 00:08:34,830
It is yellow moon tomato stew...

108
00:08:43,992 --> 00:08:48,777
No way...
This is that yellow moon tomato?

109
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:52,348
The one I used to hate?

110
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:57,728
It's delicious!

111
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:02,692
Princess...

112
00:09:23,937 --> 00:09:28,233
Princess, what happened!?

113
00:09:28,926 --> 00:09:35,683
Has bread always been this soft?

114
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:39,853
Is there any problem
with my dish?

115
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,355
No...

116
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,148
I really enjoyed it.

117
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:47,069
To think that you prepared
such a delicious food for me.

118
00:09:48,445 --> 00:09:51,199
Good work, Chef!!

119
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,659
Huh?!

120
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,121
That selfish Princess is
saying words of gratitude?!

121
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:58,373
Is she feeling sick?!

122
00:09:58,374 --> 00:10:01,084
I'm honored!

123
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:06,715
But, today's stew was made by using
the ingredients flavor to the fullest,

124
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:09,049
So I can't really take
the credit for it.

125
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:10,759
Is that so?

126
00:10:11,135 --> 00:10:11,928
Yes.

127
00:10:11,929 --> 00:10:13,279
For example,

128
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,394
Yellow moon tomato usually has a
sharp sour taste if you don't boil it.

129
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:21,064
But, if you boil it
well for three days,

130
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:27,164
it brings out the delightful tanginess
and sweetness which is hidden inside.

131
00:10:27,385 --> 00:10:31,338
As long as one is careful about the
heat, anyone can cook it.

132
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:33,465
It took 3 days?

133
00:10:33,793 --> 00:10:38,068
But if it takes that much effort,
you don't have to cook it.

134
00:10:38,069 --> 00:10:41,791
That won't do Her Highness.
It will affect your health.

135
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:48,881
As servants, it is our duty to take
care of Royal Family's health as well.

136
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:55,055
Although,
the dish I served today,

137
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:59,934
Is a luxurious dish that equals one
month wage of an ordinary person,

138
00:10:59,935 --> 00:11:03,034
So maybe,
the problem is the price.

139
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:06,849
Even if you talk about
commoner wages, I don't really...

140
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,153
Do you even have any idea how much
the food costs for Imperial Family?

141
00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:27,878
I wonder whose spiteful
voice was that earlier...

142
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,609
It's better to have some sweets
when you are using your brain!

143
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:40,141
Now, maids!
Please bring me some sweets!

144
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,558
Understood.

145
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,860
What a nice smell!

146
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:57,282
That's...

147
00:11:58,768 --> 00:11:59,953
That's a cake!

148
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:03,680
It has been a long time
since I had something as good as a cake!

149
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,516
Sorry to make you wai...!

150
00:12:24,017 --> 00:12:25,687
What have you done?!

151
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:27,856
Princess Mia, please forgive us.

152
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:29,774
Are you hurt anywhere?

153
00:12:29,775 --> 00:12:31,109
No...

154
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,862
I am okay, thank you...

155
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,549
Princess Mia is not angry?

156
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,494
Unbelievable!
Is it going to rain ice blocks today?!

157
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,162
Rather than me...

158
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:46,624
Is the girl over there okay?

159
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:51,379
For the cake,
it's fine to just bring me a new one.

160
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:55,675
Princess Mia, that's the only
cake we could get for today...

161
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,384
We're really sorry...

162
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:02,473
You!! Sit still over there!!

163
00:13:04,597 --> 00:13:07,370
You ruined my cake!

164
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,664
Ah it's the usual princess.

165
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:12,274
You! Raise your head!

166
00:13:15,944 --> 00:13:19,656
I am so sorry, my princess!

167
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,122
You're...

168
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:36,075
Hey!

169
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,092
Here's your last guest.

170
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:40,177
Come.

171
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:49,686
I am here to do your hair, Princess Mia.

172
00:13:50,312 --> 00:13:51,939
Anne...

173
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:57,969
I am sorry Princess Mia,

174
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:01,950
I was never good at
handling a comb...

175
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:04,201
Does it hurt?

176
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:09,790
Why?

177
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:15,879
Why are you still serving me?

178
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:22,094
The others stopped
coming within a month.

179
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:25,097
But you...

180
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:27,432
All these three years...

181
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,936
You kept on coming
and took care of me.

182
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:36,441
I certainly have not done
anything good to you.

183
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:39,361
It's the opposite,
I treated you poorly...

184
00:14:40,153 --> 00:14:43,240
Yes. I used to be beaten
quite a lot in the past.

185
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:45,617
I think there was a time
when you also kicked me.

186
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:52,040
But you know what?
Princess Mia's kick doesn't hurt at all.

187
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,711
Is that so?

188
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:56,435
Yes!

189
00:14:56,878 --> 00:15:00,465
Compared to the sibling fights
I had, it's nothing.

190
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:04,402
The reason that I am serving
you like this,

191
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:06,947
Is just because
I can't leave you alone.

192
00:15:07,264 --> 00:15:09,307
There is no special
reason behind it.

193
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:12,269
Hey, your time is over.

194
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,154
Come with me.

195
00:15:24,698 --> 00:15:25,657
Mi...

196
00:15:37,127 --> 00:15:38,546
Hey, you!!

197
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,762
Princess Mia!

198
00:15:47,304 --> 00:15:50,474
Please don't!!
Please raise your head!

199
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:56,897
The current me cannot reward
you for your loyalty...

200
00:15:57,481 --> 00:16:01,818
Thank you... That's the only
thing I can say to you right now.

201
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,947
Please, forgive me.

202
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:19,144
I pray that God's blessings will
always be with you, Princess Mia.

203
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:37,437
I remember now...

204
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,319
Princess Mia,
You dress will get dirty by the cream

205
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,694
Be quiet!

206
00:16:45,693 --> 00:16:47,070
Anne...

207
00:16:47,072 --> 00:16:50,700
I am truly sorry, Princess Mia.

208
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:53,287
I am not angry at all.

209
00:16:53,288 --> 00:16:55,456
Now, stand up.

210
00:16:55,457 --> 00:16:58,166
You're really not hurt, right?

211
00:16:59,376 --> 00:17:00,127
Yes...

212
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,088
Thank you...

213
00:17:04,005 --> 00:17:08,885
This time,
I can reward you for your loyalty.

214
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:13,850
I appoint you as my
personal maid from now on.

215
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:17,478
Please take care of
everything around me.

216
00:17:20,218 --> 00:17:21,707
Princess Mia,
if you allow me to speak,

217
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,734
this girl is clumsy
and a bit weird,

218
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:26,821
so I am worried that she may end up
doing something rude to you.

219
00:17:26,822 --> 00:17:29,157
Furthermore,
she is just a commoner.

220
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:32,993
Gee, aren't you guys
being rude to Anne?

221
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:37,914
Anne is my personal maid now.

222
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,668
She is under my protection.

223
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:45,548
So everyone,
please think carefully what it means.

224
00:17:57,142 --> 00:18:01,314
I knew it, those memories
aren't just a mere dream.

225
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:07,612
And this is the diary I kept on
writing even in the next 8 years...

226
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,655
If that's the case...

227
00:18:14,534 --> 00:18:17,330
Princess Mia, are you alright?

228
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:19,165
Yeah...

229
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,683
It's nothing...

230
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:24,754
But, is there anything
I can help you with?

231
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,130
Let's see...

232
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:28,857
If you are that eager to help...

233
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,273
Well... Um...

234
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:33,590
I said I'll do my best to help you, but...

235
00:18:33,591 --> 00:18:36,264
I can't really do anything big.

236
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:41,061
Can you go and buy some common
people snacks with this?

237
00:18:41,304 --> 00:18:43,480
Eh? Snacks?

238
00:18:45,273 --> 00:18:46,692
This is...

239
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:49,946
Wait! Princess! This is way
too much for snacks!

240
00:18:49,947 --> 00:18:52,990
This is the same as 60 days
worth of a maid's pay!

241
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:54,690
Oh my! Is that so?

242
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:57,328
But this is the only thing
I have on my hand...

243
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:59,372
I got it!

244
00:18:59,373 --> 00:19:04,585
You can buy something delicious for
your family with the rest of the money.

245
00:19:04,871 --> 00:19:06,270
And also...

246
00:19:06,878 --> 00:19:10,257
You should call me Mia from now.

247
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:15,846
Well, I'll leave it to you then.
Hurry up, if you can.

248
00:19:15,847 --> 00:19:18,765
I will be going to
the palace library.

249
00:19:18,932 --> 00:19:21,476
Will you be able
to bring it there?

250
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:25,690
Snacks for commoners,
I can't wait to try those!

251
00:19:32,112 --> 00:19:34,031
I get it now.

252
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:38,201
Based off my memories, which I remembered
bit by bit after reading the diary...

253
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:43,583
In the next few years, the Tearmoon
Empire's financial situation will worsen.

254
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:46,377
And as if to deal the final
blow, and epidemic occurred.

255
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:48,504
Then the people will
start a revolution,

256
00:19:48,505 --> 00:19:51,923
and the neighboring country intervene
by helping the revolutionary army......

257
00:19:52,173 --> 00:19:54,426
I guess that's the gist of it?

258
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:59,599
After all, my old self had no interest
in the outside world at all...

259
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,184
If there's no bread then
they can just eat meat, right?

260
00:20:04,477 --> 00:20:07,440
But even after knowing
what will happen,

261
00:20:07,441 --> 00:20:13,253
I don't have a single idea on how to
deal with politics and economic matters.

262
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:18,908
This is the story of a redo.

263
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,995
Mia, who returned to
her 12 years old self,

264
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,248
will run around all
over the Empire,

265
00:20:24,249 --> 00:20:29,169
basing her decisions on her memories
of the future, and her ragged diary.

266
00:20:30,086 --> 00:20:33,299
I won't give up, no matter what!

267
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,052
Everything is to avoid the future
of being executed by guillotine!!

268
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:46,646
<i>To remember what went down today</i>

269
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:51,374
<i>I'll journal every single word</i>

270
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,878
<i>Whether it's good or bad</i>

271
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:59,742
<i>It's my only life, gotta seize the day</i>

272
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:04,262
<i>You never realize
the importance of something</i>

273
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:07,390
<i>Until it's out of sight</i>

274
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:20,762
<i>Every beginning is for a perfect ending</i>

275
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:26,699
<i>Dear Moon, I won’t just pray</i>

276
00:21:26,701 --> 00:21:30,955
<i>Let me stand on my own feet,
just one more time</i>

277
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:36,711
<i>Sweet Moon, not just a shiny stone</i>

278
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:41,216
<i>I’ll find sweet joy</i>

279
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:48,012
<i>And a future that is sky blue and clear</i>

280
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:53,978
<i>Queen of the Night</i>

281
00:21:54,713 --> 00:22:01,396
<i>I am the Queen of the Night</i>

282
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,789
In Tearmoon Empire's capital
Lunatia,

283
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:16,068
there are five moon ministries which
maintains the Emperor's rule.

284
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:19,155
The administrative agency for the
capital city, Azure Moon Ministry.

285
00:22:19,156 --> 00:22:22,258
The political administrative agency for
the rural regions, Scarlet Moon Ministry.

286
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,244
Ministry for foreign affairs,
Jade Moon Ministry.

287
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:28,846
The commanding ministry of the seven
armies of the empire, Ebony Moon Ministry.

288
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:32,208
And the last,
where Mia is visiting,

289
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:35,253
The tax handling ministry,
the Golden Moon Ministry.

290
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:40,984
Princess Mia, what kind of business
could you possibly have in this place?

291
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:42,975
I want to meet someone...

292
00:22:42,976 --> 00:22:43,763
No.

293
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:46,347
There is someone I must meet.

294
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:51,436
I had one more loyal
retainer beside Anne.

295
00:22:51,933 --> 00:22:57,876
To rebuild the waning empire
and help the entire royal family.

296
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:02,339
A young and excellent civil official
who worked himself to the bone.

297
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:07,677
Someone who did not abandon me
when I'm in rock bottom, until the end.

298
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,288
And in spite of
all these things,

299
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:14,043
for some reason, this person's name
is not written anywhere in the diary.

300
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:16,420
The only thing written is...

301
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:18,647
The Treacherous Four-Eyes who got
thrown out from the central capital,

302
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,089
and tossed out to
the rural area.

303
00:23:22,175 --> 00:23:24,677
Why did you approve
this useless spending?

304
00:23:25,094 --> 00:23:27,096
You should already
know about this.

305
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:32,076
If this keeps up, the day when
the Empire's finance will fall is near!

306
00:23:32,894 --> 00:23:35,313
Got you!
