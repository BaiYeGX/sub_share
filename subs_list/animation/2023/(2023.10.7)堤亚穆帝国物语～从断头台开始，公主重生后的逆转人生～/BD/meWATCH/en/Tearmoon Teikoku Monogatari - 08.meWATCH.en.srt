1
00:00:01,527 --> 00:00:05,656
So you want to go to the forest
to search for your hairpin, huh...

2
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:06,781
Yeah.

3
00:00:06,782 --> 00:00:10,369
I know that I'm being
selfish, but...

4
00:00:10,725 --> 00:00:11,409
But...

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,096
I don't really mind though.

6
00:00:14,498 --> 00:00:19,795
I owe you for giving my soldiers
a reason to retreat, Princess.

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,983
If you're fine with just me,
I'll go with you.

8
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:26,218
There's no way I'm bringing
my troops back there again.

9
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:29,346
Just the two of us?!

10
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,641
In the first place,
this guy did that to me...

11
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,770
You gotta be kidding me...

12
00:00:37,396 --> 00:00:40,332
<i>A goddess! A saint!
Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

13
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:42,626
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

14
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:45,296
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

15
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:48,657
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

16
00:00:48,658 --> 00:00:50,658
<i>I am!</i>

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,891
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going
through as a helpless princess</i>

18
00:00:56,892 --> 00:00:58,350
<i>If that's what you thought,
then go ahead!?</i>

19
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:01,102
<i>The world is always dependent
on the direction of wind</i>

20
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,772
<i>There are too many useless
things and people, seriously</i>

21
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:06,482
<i>I can't believe in anybody</i>

22
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:09,193
<i>I have noticed that, the world is</i>

23
00:01:09,193 --> 00:01:11,906
<i>so heartless</i>

24
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:13,407
<i>That is not good,
This is not good</i>

25
00:01:13,408 --> 00:01:14,575
<i>It is not good,
everything is not good</i>

26
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:16,177
<i>The reality is harsh</i>

27
00:01:16,178 --> 00:01:18,287
<i>Alteration... alteration... alteration...</i>

28
00:01:18,288 --> 00:01:21,122
<i>Everything is going to be altered...!</i>

29
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:23,901
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

30
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:27,129
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

31
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,298
<i>Even in a sad scenario</i>

32
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:32,535
<i>I am going to rewrite
everything, everything</i>

33
00:01:32,536 --> 00:01:35,053
<i>Because, because,
I am a princess</i>

34
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,264
<i>At least of my own story</i>

35
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,475
<i>I must enjoy it as much as possible</i>

36
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,562
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

37
00:01:43,563 --> 00:01:45,940
<i>I have to live with
all my strength</i>

38
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:49,150
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

39
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,443
<i>Just wait and see!</i>

40
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:55,099
<i>I shall alter my own destiny!</i>

41
00:02:00,514 --> 00:02:03,232
<i>A goddess! A saint! Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

42
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:05,817
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

43
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,196
Captain Dion.

44
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:13,659
Ah, Sir Ludwig.

45
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:16,453
I have a request...

46
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:17,996
What is it?

47
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:23,961
Once everything is over, I'd like you
to become the princess's ally too.

48
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,629
Ally?

49
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:30,384
Do you want me to join the Imperial
Guard and protect the princess?

50
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:31,552
No...

51
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,139
I'd like you to
become a general.

52
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,225
Me? A general?

53
00:02:38,684 --> 00:02:43,438
To achieve what Miss Mia wants to do,
we'll need an ally in the military too.

54
00:02:43,855 --> 00:02:46,316
So you're telling me to
climb the ranks for it?

55
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:49,987
I'm not interested in
getting promoted though...

56
00:02:50,988 --> 00:02:54,324
But well,
that might be fun to do too.

57
00:02:55,784 --> 00:02:56,910
Sir Dion...

58
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:01,039
In any case,
there's no point talking about it now.

59
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:04,543
There's no guarantee I'll be able to go
back safely from the forest, after all.

60
00:03:06,363 --> 00:03:08,939
Wait, what's funny?

61
00:03:09,214 --> 00:03:10,320
No, nothing.

62
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:12,259
It's nothing important.

63
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:15,483
If it's the princess,
I'm sure it'll be fine,

64
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:17,472
so worrying is just a waste of time.

65
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,808
Don't tell me,
that's what you're thinking?

66
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:24,605
To me, you're the one who have
that in your mind, Sir Dion.

67
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,618
The forest at night is
already scary enough,

68
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:40,871
but I have to be alone with
this cold-blooded guy...

69
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,372
But really...

70
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,876
You're sloppy when it comes to
the important parts, Princess.

71
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:51,131
Looking for something in the middle of
the night, is not convincing enough.

72
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:54,217
It's such a crude reason to
go to the forest at night.

73
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:55,969
You're too naive
with your reasoning.

74
00:03:57,721 --> 00:03:59,949
You're going to sneak, talk,

75
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,225
and settle things with the
other side by yourself, right?

76
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:05,729
Wait? That's not it?

77
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:09,108
You called me when I was
drinking and chilling,

78
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:12,570
so I thought you had something
that I can look forward to...

79
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:15,447
Ah, that's how it is, of course!

80
00:04:15,781 --> 00:04:17,074
That's what I thought.

81
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,496
Well, I don't know what you're
planning to do, but I'll follow you.

82
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,100
Depending on the circumstances,
even to hell.

83
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:25,416
Wait...?

84
00:04:25,417 --> 00:04:29,267
Don't tell me,
this is a dangerous situation...?

85
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:31,396
Hey, long time no see!

86
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:33,132
Princess.

87
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,425
What is it?!

88
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:39,471
We arrived at the place where we
got attacked, so I just called you.

89
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:42,256
Ah, I see...

90
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:43,559
Alright then.

91
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:47,563
Is this really the same place
we went in the afternoon?

92
00:04:47,564 --> 00:04:48,939
There's no doubt about it.

93
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,317
Look, there's a mark left
by an arrow on that tree.

94
00:04:53,318 --> 00:04:56,321
In any case,
I'll have to find it quick...

95
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,326
Princess, seems like everything
went according to plan.

96
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:05,330
Hey, stop lurking
and show yourself, would you?

97
00:05:10,168 --> 00:05:15,090
Considering how you haven't shot us
yet, you're not here to fight, right?

98
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:17,884
That's the Lulu tribe...?

99
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:22,573
As expected from the leader
of the Imperial army.

100
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:27,395
Little girl, you're the one who
came here in the afternoon, right?

101
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,581
T-That's right. I...

102
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:33,817
Little girl.
Where did you get this?

103
00:05:35,777 --> 00:05:36,696
That's...

104
00:05:36,697 --> 00:05:39,156
I'm asking you,
where did you get it?

105
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:41,491
Depending on your answer...

106
00:05:45,328 --> 00:05:48,665
I can't have you
act so rude now.

107
00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:55,131
The one here is the Princess of the
Empire, and I have to protect her.

108
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:56,339
At least for now.

109
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:01,136
Depending on the situation,
I won't show any mercy.

110
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,096
You...

111
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,558
How nice!

112
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:11,855
The guy who killed me, is now
putting his life on the line for me!

113
00:06:12,063 --> 00:06:13,648
By the way, Princess...

114
00:06:14,024 --> 00:06:17,904
I'm sure you already have a plan
on how to settle this, right?

115
00:06:19,362 --> 00:06:21,657
If you've calculated all this,

116
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:30,290
an order whether to kill them or not,
fight or retreat, would be appreciated.

117
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,753
Here is the meaning
behind his smile.

118
00:06:33,754 --> 00:06:36,980
"If you don't have any plan,
I won't forgive you".

119
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,508
That's right!

120
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:41,677
Those people look very angry...

121
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:44,597
But also, it's not like this
guy swore loyalty to me...

122
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:46,823
Isn't he more like, my enemy?!

123
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:48,741
Please wait!

124
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,102
You're... Liora?

125
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:54,940
Princess, good evening to you.

126
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:59,725
Actually, the person here
is the head of Lulu tribe.

127
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:00,775
And then...

128
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:04,634
This hairpin is a present
that I gave to my wife.

129
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,204
When my wife died,
my daughter inherited it.

130
00:07:08,205 --> 00:07:10,580
I see, your daughter...

131
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,710
I'm very sorry to tell you this, but...

132
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:21,799
Unfortunately,
your daughter has passed away.

133
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,968
She's dead...?

134
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:28,723
I received that from someone
that might've been your grandson.

135
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:33,770
It's present for saving him when
he collapsed in the slums, he said.

136
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:40,740
Chief, the Princess isn't
someone who would tell a lie.

137
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:44,781
We managed to pull out our troops
because of the Princess too, after all.

138
00:07:45,296 --> 00:07:48,326
But that girl kicked
our tree though.

139
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,455
Pulling out the military
needs a strong reason too.

140
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:55,750
I think the Chief can
sympathize with us.

141
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:02,299
That's true. But, it's also hard
to believe everything you said.

142
00:08:02,674 --> 00:08:04,384
This is my chance!

143
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,471
If that's so,
we should have that kid come here.

144
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:13,310
Leaving him in the slums won't
be good for his upbringing too.

145
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:16,438
You can make your
judgment afterwards.

146
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,939
Lies!

147
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:29,409
She's someone brave enough to walk into
enemy territory with just 1 subordinate.

148
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:31,745
I can't imagine she's lying.

149
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:35,166
Thank you for taking
care of my grandson.

150
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:38,169
I'd like to apologize
for my rudeness.

151
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,545
That's not needed.

152
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:46,009
I also kicked a tree in this forest
that you hold dear.

153
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:49,930
How about we call it even?

154
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:55,018
More importantly,
please be good to your grandson, okay?

155
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:59,707
Rather than letting
him stay in slums,

156
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,276
it's better for him to
go back to this forest.

157
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:05,820
We don't even know what will
trigger the skirmish after all.

158
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:14,080
I was being stubborn and
prideful because I'm the chief,

159
00:09:14,081 --> 00:09:19,709
I couldn't even allow my daughter to
marry someone from outside our tribe...

160
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:27,484
And the Princess is telling me not to
do the same mistake with my grandson!

161
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:33,056
I'm grateful for your
understanding, Princess.

162
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,351
There's no way this
is all coincidence...

163
00:09:36,851 --> 00:09:40,105
I'm sure she already dug up some
information before coming to the forest.

164
00:09:40,427 --> 00:09:43,973
Don't tell me, she intentionally
dropped the hairpin too?

165
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,820
The Wisdom of the Empire, huh...

166
00:09:47,737 --> 00:09:52,242
If it's for her,
I think I can put more effort...

167
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,956
Few days later,
Mia got back to the capital,

168
00:09:56,957 --> 00:10:00,792
and was summoned by her father,
The Tearmoon Empire's King.

169
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,479
Good day, Your Majesty.

170
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:08,509
My dear daughter, Mia.

171
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,608
Please don't call me "Your Majesty".

172
00:10:10,609 --> 00:10:14,848
You can call me Father, or even be
more pampered and call me Papa...

173
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:18,351
Well then, Father,
what is it that you want to talk about?

174
00:10:18,768 --> 00:10:22,522
I heard you went to a disputed
territory of Berman Viscounty.

175
00:10:22,856 --> 00:10:25,900
I was so shocked I felt
like I was going to faint.

176
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:29,572
Well, nothing dangerous
happened in particular.

177
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,615
That's what you said,

178
00:10:31,616 --> 00:10:35,995
but you ended up bringing the patrol
around the area back with you, right?

179
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:40,665
Gee, I wonder who the tattletale is...

180
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,502
It's quite an embarrassing story.

181
00:10:43,503 --> 00:10:47,548
I accidentally tripped on
some trees, and fell down.

182
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:48,591
What?!

183
00:10:48,592 --> 00:10:51,385
How dare that tree
tripped my Mia!

184
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:53,721
Let's burn down
the whole forest!

185
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:55,430
No, Father.

186
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,142
I fell in love with that forest.

187
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:02,562
Is it that good?

188
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:03,605
Yeah.

189
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:09,903
That's why, Father, can you add that
territory directly under my jurisdiction?

190
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:11,447
Well, yeah...

191
00:11:11,448 --> 00:11:15,700
If it's under the Princess direct control,
Sealence Forest will be saved.

192
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:20,079
But, she will be hated by Viscount Berman.

193
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,332
This is not enough.

194
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:27,587
Did I expect too
much from Miss Mia?

195
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:33,593
Is it possible that Mia is not wise,
or even a saint as I thought...?

196
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:36,739
He finally noticed the truth,

197
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,976
and his clouded eyes
are getting clearer, but then...

198
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:42,310
If that's so, Berman.

199
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:48,317
Build Princess Town beside that forest,
and construct a castle for Mia.

200
00:11:49,984 --> 00:11:51,528
He's fanning the flames!

201
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:54,114
Not only his territory
was shrunken,

202
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:57,784
now he has to build a town, and even
a castle, out of his own pocket...

203
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,664
Your Majesty!
Thank you very much!

204
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:09,295
This Berman, will give every fiber in
me to fulfill this honorable mission!

205
00:12:09,546 --> 00:12:10,672
That's right!

206
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,466
Nobles value honors
over everything else!

207
00:12:14,008 --> 00:12:17,263
Under the honor of being tasked with a
territory that's under Princess's control,

208
00:12:17,264 --> 00:12:19,681
losing a bit of territory is nothing!

209
00:12:20,223 --> 00:12:23,309
I knew it, Mia really is
the Wisdom of the Empire...

210
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:26,939
I'm ashamed that
I second-guessed it for a moment!

211
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,275
No, you were close.

212
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:36,990
Now that I think of it, I haven't received
any letter from Prince Abel lately...

213
00:12:39,242 --> 00:12:41,369
Princess Mia, you got a letter...

214
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,289
Is it from Prince Abel?

215
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:45,707
No, it's from Miss Tiona.

216
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:54,132
Tiona's little brother is...

217
00:12:55,258 --> 00:12:58,554
The Saint of the Revolution army,
Tiona Rudolvon.

218
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:02,181
Even in this famine,
she shared food with the people.

219
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:07,395
Why does that girl still
have that much food with her?

220
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:11,483
You didn't know that a new, stronger
species of wheat has been developed?

221
00:13:11,484 --> 00:13:14,153
A new wheat species?

222
00:13:14,154 --> 00:13:19,909
A cold-resistant wheat, developed by
Tiona's little brother, Cyril Rudolvon.

223
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,453
I didn't know about it at all!

224
00:13:22,454 --> 00:13:26,121
Well, Cyril was under Lady Rafina,

225
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:29,042
and was working in a research facility in
Holy Principality of Belluga, after all.

226
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:31,045
That's unfair!

227
00:13:31,046 --> 00:13:35,006
I want a brilliant
little brother too!

228
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,927
A genius kid, Cyril Rudolvon...

229
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,887
A sly little brother...

230
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,139
What's wrong?

231
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:46,310
It's about Tiona's
little brother.

232
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:48,672
He's a very talented,

233
00:13:48,674 --> 00:13:52,113
but apparently he can't go to school
due to financial difficulties...

234
00:13:53,691 --> 00:13:58,988
And so, they were asking me to
mediate between them and Lady Rafina.

235
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,532
I see.

236
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:06,037
So that the little brother can study at
Holy Principality of Belluga as well.

237
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,974
Of course, I won't let that happen.

238
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:14,227
As expected from the Princess.

239
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:18,466
To think that she solved the case
without shedding a drop of blood.

240
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,470
Her wisdom is well known
in the school too.

241
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:25,056
But father, is that okay?

242
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:27,892
Even though the lands near the
forest got taken away unfairly...

243
00:14:28,226 --> 00:14:29,644
It's not unfair.

244
00:14:29,978 --> 00:14:33,272
The Imperial family
have the right to do so.

245
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:36,986
More importantly, if it can be resolved
without putting people into suffering,

246
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:38,790
that's great enough.

247
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,406
I see...

248
00:14:40,407 --> 00:14:43,741
So, why is Princess Mia coming here then?

249
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:48,413
Most probably about
the forest case, but...

250
00:14:48,663 --> 00:14:55,087
I also sent a letter to her, but to think
that she'd come to the frontier like this.

251
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:56,546
That's very typical of her.

252
00:15:00,176 --> 00:15:04,214
Both my father and sister are
fawning over Princess Mia.

253
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:06,515
I wonder what kind of person she is.

254
00:15:06,757 --> 00:15:09,892
These are quite some
beautiful flowers.

255
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:14,314
Are they Sweet Moon...?

256
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,654
Ah, yeah, that's true...

257
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:22,739
Miss Mia, it's about time...

258
00:15:23,197 --> 00:15:26,159
Miss Mia?! This person is?!

259
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:34,876
Let's turn back time for a bit...

260
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,089
The boy who loves flowers...

261
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,448
If he managed to
develop a new wheat,

262
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,598
I'm sure he's
knowledgeable about plants!

263
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,805
Flowers are plants!

264
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:49,391
That boy is Cyril Rudolvon!

265
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:52,727
I bet I scored some
affection points with that!

266
00:15:54,353 --> 00:16:00,334
I'm really grateful to you,
for taking care of my daughter at school.

267
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,364
No no,
taking care is a bit too much...

268
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:06,574
And also, regarding the Sealence
forest incident from a few days ago...

269
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,452
More importantly, Sir Rudolvon.

270
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:13,539
I'm actually here to
give you a suggestion.

271
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:16,835
A suggestion, huh...

272
00:16:16,836 --> 00:16:20,671
I heard your son, Cyril,
is a brilliant child.

273
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:29,014
Are you going to recommend Cyril so he
can enroll in the Saint Noelle Academy?

274
00:16:29,015 --> 00:16:37,189
No. We're not that foolish to send
our talents outside the country.

275
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:40,192
What do you mean by that?

276
00:16:40,193 --> 00:16:45,029
Do you know that a Princess Town will
be made in Viscount Berman's territory?

277
00:16:46,197 --> 00:16:46,781
Yes...

278
00:16:47,323 --> 00:16:51,662
I'm planning to build
a school in that city.

279
00:16:51,663 --> 00:16:53,580
A school?

280
00:16:53,581 --> 00:17:00,546
Yes. It'll be great if we have a school
like Saint Noelle in the Empire, right?

281
00:17:02,255 --> 00:17:03,799
How about it?

282
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,570
Are you interested in making Cyril
the first student of my school?

283
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,897
Me?!

284
00:17:11,305 --> 00:17:14,101
With this distance,
he can go to school from here.

285
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:17,411
Moreover, since it's a public school,
we can lessen the tuition fee.

286
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:21,607
It's such a good deal for
our poor Rudolvon family...

287
00:17:23,151 --> 00:17:26,195
I'm honored with your
considerations for us.

288
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:31,426
If there's anything
our family can do to repay you...

289
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:36,165
Well then,
I'd like the wheat that you have.

290
00:17:37,373 --> 00:17:39,000
Wheat...?

291
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:41,795
It's not like I want you to
sell it to me with lower price,

292
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:44,881
but I'd like you to store
them as much as possible.

293
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:47,676
And when a famine comes...

294
00:17:47,677 --> 00:17:52,346
Well, of course, by your orders,
I'll provide them to you.

295
00:17:53,014 --> 00:17:55,808
That's not what I meant,
Outland Count.

296
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,812
If I do that, I'll just end up
getting hated by the people again...

297
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:05,693
I'd like the Rudolvon house to
distribute it to the people, directly.

298
00:18:05,902 --> 00:18:09,573
And at that time,
I'd like you to mention my name...

299
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:13,951
So, you're saying that
it's fine to use your name?

300
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,704
That's right.

301
00:18:15,705 --> 00:18:19,916
Please use my name,
and spread it as much as you can!

302
00:18:22,001 --> 00:18:24,045
I'm impressed...

303
00:18:26,214 --> 00:18:28,509
We've experienced
crop failure before.

304
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,845
But then, the high nobles came,
and took away our wheat...

305
00:18:33,262 --> 00:18:38,143
Even so, I tried to distribute it to
the people for free, but they told me...

306
00:18:38,144 --> 00:18:40,937
That is a treason
towards the Empire.

307
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:44,942
But Princess saw through all that,
and told me this.

308
00:18:44,943 --> 00:18:47,693
So I can answer,
I did it under the order of the Princess.

309
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:52,574
Such wisdom...
Such compassion...

310
00:18:53,878 --> 00:18:55,661
What's with this response?

311
00:18:55,662 --> 00:19:01,542
I'm basically leaving all the hard work
to them, and hand me the achievements!

312
00:19:01,543 --> 00:19:05,253
Mia's heart was beating
hard for the whole time.

313
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,508
Let me say this to
align ourselves.

314
00:19:09,509 --> 00:19:11,677
The school that Cyril will attend,

315
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:15,763
is not a grand place where
high nobles would go, okay?

316
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:22,019
I'm thinking of accepting students from
normal citizens, and Lulu tribe too.

317
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:29,627
Mia is trying to say that she's not
going to raise their son's status.

318
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:34,383
That's... I can't be thankful
enough for your consideration...

319
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:35,866
What?!

320
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,122
To make an environment
where Cyril can learn,

321
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:42,873
without being bullied by high nobles...

322
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:48,087
Moreover, she even created a way to build
friendly relations with Lulu tribe...

323
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,424
This person, don't tell me...

324
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:56,096
He's a bully, or maybe he feels
good from being mistreated?!

325
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:57,013
What?

326
00:19:57,555 --> 00:20:01,559
Miss Mia... She's beautiful,
and wise to top it off...

327
00:20:01,904 --> 00:20:05,655
W-Well, with this,
I got Cyril on my hand,

328
00:20:05,657 --> 00:20:10,235
and their crops are practically mine too!

329
00:20:10,236 --> 00:20:13,237
It all ends with a good result.

330
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:20,244
I'm feeling exhausted
after all that...

331
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:25,708
Oh right, I haven't checked
it for a while now...

332
00:20:42,725 --> 00:20:46,104
What's the meaning of this...?

333
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:47,981
Why is my diary gone...?

334
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:52,693
How will I evade the
guillotine without it?!

335
00:20:53,611 --> 00:20:54,905
But wait...

336
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,365
It's the other way around...

337
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,200
As long as I still
have the diary,

338
00:20:58,201 --> 00:21:01,578
it's decided that I'll be
executed by the guillotine...

339
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:04,830
Now that it's gone,
that means....

340
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:08,960
Is it that the future where
I die by the Guillotine is gone?

341
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:10,295
I did it!

342
00:21:10,296 --> 00:21:12,631
I finally did it!

343
00:21:12,632 --> 00:21:16,218
I want to share this joy with
someone, right now!

344
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:20,930
But, the one I really
want to tell, is Prince Abel!

345
00:21:26,602 --> 00:21:29,939
Seems like the Empire is
getting back on it's feet.

346
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:36,195
That youngster from Gold Moon Ministry,
Ludwig, is pretty exceptional too...

347
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:39,700
I thought they'll be done
with just a famine, but...

348
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:44,329
It seems like Princess Mia and
Prince Sion are getting along well too.

349
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,874
Seems like we have to consider our
plan of breaking them up as failed.

350
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,352
The Wisdom of the Empire, huh...

351
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:52,586
What an annoying brat.

352
00:21:53,003 --> 00:21:57,007
In any case,
it doesn't change what we have to do.

353
00:21:57,842 --> 00:22:01,470
We'll halt our plan
for the Empire.

354
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,806
Let's change the target...

355
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,067
<i>To remember what went down today</i>

356
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:18,655
<i>I'll journal every single word</i>

357
00:22:18,656 --> 00:22:22,242
<i>Whether it's good or bad</i>

358
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:27,038
<i>It's my only life,
gotta seize the day</i>

359
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,543
<i>You never realize the
importance of something</i>

360
00:22:31,544 --> 00:22:34,838
<i>Until it's out of sight</i>

361
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:47,892
<i>Every beginning is
for a perfect ending</i>

362
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:53,982
<i>Dear Moon, I won't just pray</i>

363
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:58,445
<i>Let me stand on my own
feet, just one more time</i>

364
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:03,867
<i>Sweet Moon,
not just a shiny stone</i>

365
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:08,121
<i>I'll find sweet joy</i>

366
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:15,353
<i>And a future that is
sky blue and clear</i>

367
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:21,927
<i>Queen of the Night</i>

368
00:23:21,928 --> 00:23:32,311
<i>I am the Queen of the Night</i>
