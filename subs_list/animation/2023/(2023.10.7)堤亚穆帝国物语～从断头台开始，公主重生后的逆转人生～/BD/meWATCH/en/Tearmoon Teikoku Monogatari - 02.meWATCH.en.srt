1
00:00:00,692 --> 00:00:03,946
This is Tearmoon Empire,
Golden Moon Ministry.

2
00:00:04,446 --> 00:00:06,282
Excuse me, Princess Mia.

3
00:00:06,283 --> 00:00:09,869
What kind of business
could you possibly have in this place?

4
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,876
It's nothing much.

5
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:14,206
I just have someone
I'd like to meet.

6
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:17,518
Someone you'd like to meet...

7
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,420
Don't tell me!

8
00:00:22,297 --> 00:00:27,345
If that's the case, Anne
will support you with all I can!

9
00:00:27,346 --> 00:00:31,432
Seems like Anne made her own
assumption, and got fired up from it...

10
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:35,686
Without noticing it,
Mia remembered something.

11
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:41,834
Her encounter in the
previous timeline,

12
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:46,339
with the young civil official who
fought alone to rebuild the Empire.

13
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:50,492
So you are Ludwig.

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,663
I've heard a lot about you.

15
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:57,958
You did well this time.

16
00:00:58,834 --> 00:01:04,173
Do you people even have any idea how
much the food costs for Imperial Family?

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,095
Why are you saying that,

18
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:12,181
even though I went through the
trouble of coming here to praise you?!

19
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,979
You're going to bother people
if you keep on standing there.

20
00:01:19,062 --> 00:01:25,360
If you have time, then do the things that
only a princess can do, Princess Mia.

21
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,118
That damned treacherous
four-eyes, I'll never forgive him!

22
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,871
Their first meeting
was just the worst.

23
00:01:36,288 --> 00:01:38,374
Third-class tax officer, Ludwig!

24
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:42,878
If you keep saying that, I'll transfer
you to the Crimson Moon Ministry!

25
00:01:43,212 --> 00:01:44,755
This is bad.

26
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:48,176
When Ludwig got
sent to rural area,

27
00:01:48,177 --> 00:01:51,224
he could only come back when it's
too late for Tearmoon Empire...

28
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:53,388
In other words,
if this continues...

29
00:01:55,075 --> 00:01:58,403
The guillotine will
come straight for me!

30
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,663
Please hold it!

31
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:03,525
Princess Mia?!

32
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,507
Mia, what are you...?

33
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:10,614
Can I have some of your time?

34
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:13,909
Mia is so daring!

35
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,308
<i>A goddess! A saint! Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

36
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,601
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

37
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:26,271
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

38
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:29,633
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

39
00:02:29,634 --> 00:02:31,634
<i>I am!</i>

40
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,866
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going
through as a helpless princess</i>

41
00:02:37,868 --> 00:02:39,325
<i>If that's what you thought,
then go ahead!?</i>

42
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:42,078
<i>The world is always dependent
on the direction of wind</i>

43
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,747
<i>There are too many useless
things and people, seriously</i>

44
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:47,458
<i>I can't believe in anybody</i>

45
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,169
<i>I have noticed that, the world is</i>

46
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,881
<i>so heartless</i>

47
00:02:52,883 --> 00:02:54,382
<i>That is not good,
This is not good</i>

48
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:55,550
<i>It is not good,
everything is not good</i>

49
00:02:55,552 --> 00:02:57,153
<i>The reality is harsh</i>

50
00:02:57,154 --> 00:02:59,262
<i>Alteration... alteration...alteration...</i>

51
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:02,098
<i>Everything is going to be altered...!</i>

52
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,877
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

53
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,104
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

54
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,273
<i>Even in a sad scenario</i>

55
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:13,511
<i>I am going to rewrite
everything, everything</i>

56
00:03:13,512 --> 00:03:16,029
<i>Because, because,
I am a princess</i>

57
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,240
<i>At least of my own story</i>

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,451
<i>I must enjoy it as much as possible</i>

59
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,537
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

60
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,915
<i>I have to live with
all my strength</i>

61
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:30,126
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

62
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,419
<i>Just wait and see!</i>

63
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:36,075
<i>I shall alter my own destiny!</i>

64
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,208
<i>A goddess! A saint! Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

65
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,793
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

66
00:03:49,004 --> 00:03:53,301
Wait, I have work to do though...

67
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:55,886
I just want to have a little talk.

68
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:59,682
I've told you I'm busy though...

69
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:03,018
I have something
I'd like you to tell me.

70
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,604
You'll just ignore it, huh...

71
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:10,692
She's even more selfish
than what I heard...

72
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,862
So, what is it that
you want to ask?

73
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:18,658
Alright...
I'll go straight to the point.

74
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:24,723
It's about what we should do to
rebuild the Empire's economy.

75
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:30,963
If that's so,
let me ask you, Princess Mia.

76
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:36,468
In the first place, do you even
know how much you food spending is?

77
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,157
If you don't even know that,

78
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:43,242
rebuilding the Empire's
economy is just a dream.

79
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,768
Let's see...

80
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:49,690
For one meal, it's almost equal to
one month of your pay...

81
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:52,201
So it's around
one Crescent Moon gold coin...

82
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:53,610
Is that correct?

83
00:04:55,237 --> 00:04:59,826
To explain the Empire's financial
problem in a simple way...

84
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:05,872
Our expenditure is more than our
income, and to solve that problem...

85
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,423
Are you listening, Princess?

86
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,093
To think that our princess,

87
00:05:17,094 --> 00:05:21,013
doesn't even understand our
country situation at the moment.

88
00:05:21,014 --> 00:05:23,433
You're wholly a
decoration princess.

89
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:27,478
To explain the Empire's financial
problem in a simple way,

90
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,232
our expenditure is
more than our income.

91
00:05:31,233 --> 00:05:33,191
And to solve that...

92
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:35,278
That damned four-eyes!

93
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,949
I'll write this humiliation word to word
in my diary, so I won't forget it, ever!

94
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,597
So, to sum it up...

95
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:45,413
Other than that, we have several
major problems inside the Empire,

96
00:05:45,415 --> 00:05:48,102
Especially the deteriorating
relation with neighboring countries,

97
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:49,959
Will bring an
unmeasurable effect.

98
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,652
It's a 100% plagiarism.

99
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,754
That's enough.

100
00:05:57,007 --> 00:06:00,677
I wonder where Mia went...

101
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:13,148
Mia's love has set in motion?!

102
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:19,238
I'm impressed that there's a wise
person like you in the royal family.

103
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:24,118
Wise, he said?!

104
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:29,373
That treacherous four-eyes
is complimenting me?!

105
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:34,461
It feels like I was
reborn just for this day!

106
00:06:35,003 --> 00:06:37,130
But, Princess Mia...

107
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:43,137
If you understand that much,
then even without borrowing my strength,

108
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:46,348
You'd be able to rebuild this
Empire on your own, right?

109
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:51,020
This is bad! I got too cocky!

110
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:55,107
Ah, well, that's true, but, you see...

111
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:58,568
This is bad!
I can't think of anything!

112
00:06:59,444 --> 00:07:00,612
Ah, I see.

113
00:07:01,112 --> 00:07:03,406
Princess Mia is still young after all.

114
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:09,079
Are you worried that no one
will listen to you seriously?

115
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:15,294
Yeah, that! That's totally it!

116
00:07:15,295 --> 00:07:17,630
Mia was totally on board.

117
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:23,469
Besides, no matter how wise I am,
I will still make mistakes.

118
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:28,390
That's why, I'd like you to think,
and tell me what you think!

119
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,489
She's not blinded by her intelligence,

120
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,688
And she'll even lend her
ear to her retainers...

121
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:35,982
She's really...

122
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:41,404
The shock has clouded
Ludwig's judgment.

123
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:44,656
If that's so...

124
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:50,787
I, Ludwig, shall devote all my body
and soul to cooperate with you.

125
00:07:55,458 --> 00:08:00,338
Princess Mia,
this will be my final greetings to you.

126
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:04,068
A lot has happened, but...

127
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:10,223
I didn't hate the days when
I worked with you, at all.

128
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:19,399
And so, Mia gained another
strong ally right after Anne.

129
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:28,116
Let's see,
what will happen next?

130
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,038
What?!

131
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:40,086
And so, that's how my days being
praised as being wise started...

132
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:42,714
This is...

133
00:08:42,964 --> 00:08:49,220
So that means, due to my cooperation
with Ludwig, the history took a big turn?

134
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:52,349
if that's so, could it be...

135
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:05,153
My fate with the guillotine
hasn't changed yet...

136
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:09,950
It'll be fine,
I still have time after all.

137
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:13,954
As long as I keep on reading the
overwritten diary and make plans!

138
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:17,124
The epidemic in the capital city slums,

139
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:20,561
Rebellion from minority
groups in remote areas,

140
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:23,505
Other than that,
international problems, etc...

141
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:28,427
What should I do?!

142
00:09:28,428 --> 00:09:29,594
That's right!

143
00:09:30,512 --> 00:09:32,989
Anne! That damned four-eye...

144
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:37,436
I mean,
let's go to Ludwig's place!

145
00:09:37,437 --> 00:09:39,390
Ah, the one from yesterday!

146
00:09:39,392 --> 00:09:42,816
If that's so,
we'll need to fix your outfit!

147
00:09:43,108 --> 00:09:47,071
Really?
I think this is good enough...

148
00:09:47,072 --> 00:09:52,200
No! What would you do if it
doesn't have any appeal to boys?!

149
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:58,124
It looks nice on you, Princess Mia!

150
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,333
Really?

151
00:09:59,334 --> 00:10:00,334
Yeah!

152
00:10:00,646 --> 00:10:02,127
For the finishing touch, wear this.

153
00:10:04,587 --> 00:10:08,007
Ah, this is...

154
00:10:08,383 --> 00:10:14,222
That's a present from a wealthy
merchant to Mia, from last year.

155
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,891
I... See...

156
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:22,313
And then, where are we going
after we meet that person?

157
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,233
Well...!

158
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:30,573
Why are we in the
New Moon district?

159
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:33,408
Princess Mia, let's go back.

160
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,620
This is a place where even
commoners won't step into.

161
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,139
We don't know what lies here...

162
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:42,125
No, this is important.

163
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:46,713
I'd like Ludwig to see it directly,
and tell me about it.

164
00:10:49,507 --> 00:10:50,717
But...

165
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:52,761
Quite the stench...

166
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:56,055
I don't mind it
that much though...?

167
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:00,685
This is nothing compared
to that underground jail!

168
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:08,151
For those who live in this place, I'm
sure they can't even take a bath easily.

169
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:14,866
It's normal for humans to smell if
we don't wash up for several days.

170
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:17,953
Rather than that, let's just go!

171
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:21,707
Princess Mia,
where exactly are you heading to?

172
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:24,918
Let's see...

173
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:27,337
What's that?

174
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:33,469
Excuse me, are you okay?

175
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,345
Wait, Princess!

176
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:42,060
Probably he can't move
due to starvation...

177
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:45,146
This is common around this area.

178
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:51,152
I see. Being starved sure is
a painful experience, huh...

179
00:11:51,855 --> 00:11:55,241
Anne, please share the
snacks that we have with him.

180
00:11:55,242 --> 00:11:56,574
Ah, yes!

181
00:11:57,575 --> 00:12:02,038
With his nutritional condition, it's a
matter of time before he gets sick...

182
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:07,586
Few years from now, the capital
will be affected by an epidemic...

183
00:12:07,587 --> 00:12:10,673
A huge part of the
population died,

184
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:15,176
and the financial situation that Ludwig
managed to improve, ended up worsening.

185
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:18,513
We can't leave it as it is.

186
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,306
But...

187
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,684
Ludwig.

188
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:28,481
What should we do to prevent an epidemic
coming from this place in the future?

189
00:12:29,566 --> 00:12:31,401
A way to prevent an epidemic!?

190
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:37,449
Mia, I think it's better if
we let this child rest somewhere first.

191
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,578
There seems to be a
church across the road.

192
00:12:40,587 --> 00:12:43,296
I understand.
Let's move there then.

193
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,897
I didn't even think about it...

194
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,796
I'm so preoccupied with preventing
the Empire's financial crisis,

195
00:12:50,797 --> 00:12:53,340
and lately, since I have
the Princesses's backing,

196
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:56,926
our initiative has
shown their result too.

197
00:12:57,552 --> 00:13:02,765
But, if somehow an epidemic
happens, that would be for naught...

198
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04,451
And she...

199
00:13:05,268 --> 00:13:06,395
This person...

200
00:13:06,396 --> 00:13:11,858
She noticed the dangers,
and is trying to make me notice it?

201
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:18,239
Is she the great leader that
the heavens has sent for us?

202
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:23,578
That's what Ludwig
decided on his own.

203
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:29,627
Father, thank you for
accepting this sick person.

204
00:13:29,628 --> 00:13:30,623
Don't mention it.

205
00:13:30,624 --> 00:13:35,507
I'm just doing my duty as
someone who serves God.

206
00:13:35,837 --> 00:13:37,025
Princess Mia.

207
00:13:37,842 --> 00:13:41,596
I've summarized the
prevention for an epidemic.

208
00:13:41,846 --> 00:13:44,933
I see. As expected from Ludwig.

209
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,435
We have 2 ways to
prevent the illness.

210
00:13:47,852 --> 00:13:52,065
It's to improve the people's
stamina by distributing food.

211
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,401
Next, is to improve our
medical institutions.

212
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:57,862
But for that...

213
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:01,824
We'll need a lot of money...
Right?

214
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:05,162
It's not just
building hospitals,

215
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:08,164
but the maintenance cost and
continuous food distribution.

216
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:13,127
We have to review the finances from
ground up, and squeeze our spending.

217
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,423
I see...

218
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,094
If that's so...

219
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:33,314
Will it be enough
if I sell this?

220
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:37,611
Mia?! That's your favorite, right?!

221
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:39,445
I don't mind.

222
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:44,493
No matter how dear an item is,
no matter how strong you hold on to it,

223
00:14:44,494 --> 00:14:48,579
it can be lost,
or even broken when the time comes.

224
00:14:48,913 --> 00:14:52,583
If that's so, we should use
it in the most worthwhile way.

225
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,752
Mia...

226
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:58,006
Princess... You're...

227
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:00,508
You're truly a saint!

228
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:05,013
Yep. The most worthwhile way.

229
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:09,326
Rather than having it taken
by those scums in the future,

230
00:15:09,327 --> 00:15:13,955
It's 100 million times better
to sell and use it for my own sake!

231
00:15:16,566 --> 00:15:20,195
I can truly understand
your feelings.

232
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:25,825
I, Ludwig, shall make the most
out of this treasure you gave me.

233
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:30,848
I'm sure Princess Mia understands,

234
00:15:30,849 --> 00:15:35,418
that even by selling this
hairpin, it won't be enough.

235
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:39,797
But this is the utmost sympathy
that this young princess shows.

236
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:43,301
We still need a lot of funds.

237
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:47,555
Nobles of the Empire,
what do you think?

238
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:51,560
The nobles will be surprised
by this show of sympathy,

239
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,562
and they'll have to give out
some money of their own too!

240
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:56,648
And so, 20 days later,

241
00:15:56,649 --> 00:16:02,320
it's decided that a huge hospital
will be built in New Moon district.

242
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:08,994
I bought a popular frozen
sweets from the streets!

243
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:11,455
That looks delicious!

244
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,265
When I told them that Mia is the one
buying, they gave us a lot of bonus.

245
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:21,382
The whole city knows that you inspired
building the hospital in New Moon District.

246
00:16:21,383 --> 00:16:22,549
Is that so?

247
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,968
Yes! They're like
"Mia is our Goddess!".

248
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:28,972
How exaggerated...

249
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:34,019
No! I'm really honored to
serve such a wonderful person!

250
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:40,437
Well then, as a special treat, this kind
princess will share the snacks with you.

251
00:16:40,438 --> 00:16:41,877
Are you sure?

252
00:16:41,878 --> 00:16:43,212
Yes!

253
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,616
Is something wrong?

254
00:16:47,617 --> 00:16:52,412
No, I'm just thinking that I'd like
my sister, Elise, to try it too...

255
00:16:52,413 --> 00:16:56,624
Elise has a weak constitution,
and she rarely goes out...

256
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:59,794
So, I'm sure she never
tried a frozen snack too...

257
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:04,715
If that's so, how about we
visit your home after this?

258
00:17:11,222 --> 00:17:12,640
It's delicious...

259
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:17,813
Sorry... I look like this
in front of the Princess...

260
00:17:17,814 --> 00:17:19,939
Don't force yourself,
take it easy.

261
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:21,524
But...

262
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:24,319
Elise, just accept her kindness.

263
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:30,659
Mia has a big heart, so she'll
forgive such a minor discourtesy.

264
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:33,716
Yes, no problem at all!

265
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:43,173
It melts, and the sweet smell hits your
nose as you put it inside your mouth!

266
00:17:43,331 --> 00:17:45,424
Frozen snacks are the best!

267
00:17:45,425 --> 00:17:48,218
Mia was too focused
on her snack.

268
00:17:48,219 --> 00:17:50,137
It's nice, isn't is, Elise.

269
00:17:50,138 --> 00:17:53,049
You've been saying that you want
to meet Princess Mia lately.

270
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:56,351
Do you want to
meet me that much?

271
00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:57,247
Yes!

272
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:02,331
I, I'm writing a story!

273
00:18:02,732 --> 00:18:05,902
"The Poor Prince and
The Golden Dragon"...

274
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,547
I feel like I've heard of
this title somewhere...?

275
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:13,452
"The Poor Prince and
The Golden Dragon".

276
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:16,370
This is a story between
a prince and a dragon.

277
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:21,376
They started a journey to make the
people of this country smile, one by one.

278
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:23,169
Please tell me more.

279
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:26,879
Spending everyday inside
the jail is just so boring...

280
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:28,005
Yes.

281
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:31,093
But it seems like it's still
in the middle of writing...

282
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:35,095
I'll bring it once I received the
continuation from the author, okay?

283
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:37,016
I'll be looking forward to it!

284
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,853
She couldn't write
the continuation?

285
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:42,647
I'm sorry...

286
00:18:43,064 --> 00:18:46,192
I couldn't tell you the
story until the end...

287
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:49,446
What happened?
Is she having a slump?

288
00:18:49,447 --> 00:18:50,738
That's not it!

289
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:53,282
She died...

290
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:57,329
She has always been weak...

291
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,998
And due to the famine,
she couldn't eat nutritious food...

292
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:03,627
So...

293
00:19:03,628 --> 00:19:06,170
That was about Elise, huh...

294
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:09,632
This story is
really interesting.

295
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:15,972
Elise, I'd like you to serve me
as my personal artist.

296
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:17,406
Me...?

297
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:18,891
Yeah.

298
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,178
Then, you won't have to worry
about money and livelihood,

299
00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:24,895
you can just focus
on your writing.

300
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,191
Sorry, but please stop.

301
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:29,820
Why?

302
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:33,531
I don't think it's bad for you though?

303
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,995
Don't play favorites on me
just because of my sister!

304
00:19:37,996 --> 00:19:41,456
Elise!
What are you saying to Mia?!

305
00:19:41,457 --> 00:19:44,750
I want to fight
with my own works!

306
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:48,754
I don't want to become a writer
just because my sister!

307
00:19:49,945 --> 00:19:54,635
I gave this idea because I'm amazed
by your literary talents though?

308
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:58,347
That's a lie. There's no way
you read it that quickly!

309
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:02,977
Elise, you should remember this.

310
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:06,154
I despise lies.

311
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:09,650
Let's see...

312
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,899
The best parts of
this story are...

313
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,659
First, how the protagonist, the prince,
is written in a very enchanting way.

314
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,580
Also, the banter with the dragon who has
a slightly bad personality is interesting.

315
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:26,584
Amazing, in such a short time...

316
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:31,255
Also, the fight scene on the
bridge with the antagonist, Simon.

317
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,235
I just can't get enough
when they crossed swords,

318
00:20:35,236 --> 00:20:37,637
With all their fiery
feelings in it.

319
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:39,597
Princess...

320
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,807
What is it?

321
00:20:43,184 --> 00:20:47,229
How do you know about things
that aren't even written yet?

322
00:20:50,526 --> 00:20:53,716
Oh no!!

323
00:20:53,718 --> 00:20:57,403
That's right, the one I know was
from several years from this day!

324
00:20:57,405 --> 00:21:00,666
Of course,
it has more things written than now!

325
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:05,414
I didn't even think of that
and talked about it mindlessly!

326
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:08,334
There's nothing to be surprised of, Elise.

327
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:10,712
For the Wise Mia,

328
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:14,757
she can easily understand the flow
even if it's still half-written.

329
00:21:15,049 --> 00:21:20,180
It happens to Ludwig occasionally, but
seems like Anne's condition is severe too.

330
00:21:20,181 --> 00:21:22,723
That's right! That's how it is!

331
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:27,229
I see!

332
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,940
This girl totally
is Anne's sister...

333
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:35,069
I'll say this again, Elise.

334
00:21:35,778 --> 00:21:38,364
Become my personal writer.

335
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:43,119
Also, give your all
to write this story.

336
00:21:44,453 --> 00:21:45,204
Yes!

337
00:21:45,996 --> 00:21:48,833
Thank you, Princess Mia!

338
00:21:49,276 --> 00:21:55,298
And so, another zealous Mia fanatic
has born in the Empire.

339
00:21:55,635 --> 00:22:01,972
She will write "The Saint,
Princess Mia story" in the future.

340
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:08,228
A highly glorified and mostly fiction
book, and it sells like hotcakes...

341
00:22:08,229 --> 00:22:10,980
But it's a story
for another time.

342
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:58,919
(School admission guide)

343
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,630
(Saint Noelle Academy)

344
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:07,578
Once spring comes, I'll leave the castle
and live in Saint Noelle Academy dorms...

345
00:23:07,787 --> 00:23:13,000
I read the diary countless time,
and made preparations on my own.

346
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:17,672
For the slim chance that
a rebellion occurred,

347
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:20,967
I made connections with useful
people as much as possible.

348
00:23:20,968 --> 00:23:24,970
Stay away from dangerous people who
might be connected to my guillotine fate.

349
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:30,059
Especially Tiona Rudolvon
and Sion Sol Sunkland.

350
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:33,521
I have to avoid
those 2 at all cost!
