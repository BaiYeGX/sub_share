1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,463
Good and bad news, you say?

2
00:00:03,464 --> 00:00:06,716
I'd like to report it to you
first, Prince Sion.

3
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:07,841
Is that okay?

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,182
Prince Abel, how's your wound?

5
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:18,644
It's fine,
your retainer saved me.

6
00:00:19,042 --> 00:00:23,782
It feels like Prince Abel
got a bit manlier again...

7
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:27,695
Princess Mia? It looks like your
face is a bit red, are you okay?

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,739
It's nothing!

9
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,284
Did you push yourself
too hard to get here?

10
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:35,786
I think it's you who's
pushing yourself too hard...

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,330
Geez, I don't care anymore!

12
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:43,920
You ignored me and did
something dangerous just now.

13
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:47,465
And Sion, he almost cut
Prince Abel for real too!

14
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,258
It's outrageous!

15
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,096
So you call Prince Sion
just with his name now...

16
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:59,726
It's just to hide our identity,
there's no deep meaning to it.

17
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:03,230
Ah, I see. That's a relief.

18
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,233
Is he jealous?

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,194
Gee, can't help it then.

20
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,868
As an adult,
I'll suggest something nice for you!

21
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:17,744
Let's call each other
by name, like that!

22
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:21,123
Ah, erm...

23
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:27,088
I... Don't mind too.

24
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:28,922
You can...

25
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:30,757
Erm...

26
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,178
Just call me Mia...

27
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,699
But in exchange, I'd like to...
Erm...

28
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:41,560
Call you as Abel...

29
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,345
Really?

30
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:49,903
If that's so, then, Mi-Mia...

31
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:51,361
Yes!

32
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,906
A-Abel...

33
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,158
Yes!

34
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,243
Prince Abel, Mia.

35
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,704
I have something to tell you.

36
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,542
I have to apologize.

37
00:02:04,804 --> 00:02:06,268
What do you mean?!

38
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:14,594
This revolt was caused by a rogue squad
from our intelligence agency, Wind Crow.

39
00:02:16,422 --> 00:02:18,013
What did you say?!

40
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,309
<i>A goddess! A saint!
Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

41
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,603
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

42
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:27,273
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

43
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:30,634
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

44
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:32,635
<i>I am!</i>

45
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,868
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going
through as a helpless princess</i>

46
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,327
<i>If that's what you thought,
then go ahead!?</i>

47
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:43,079
<i>The world is always dependent
on the direction of wind</i>

48
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,749
<i>There are too many useless
things and people, seriously</i>

49
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,459
<i>I can't believe in anybody</i>

50
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,170
<i>I have noticed that, the world is</i>

51
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,883
<i>so heartless</i>

52
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:55,384
<i>That is not good,
This is not good</i>

53
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:56,552
<i>It is not good,
everything is not good</i>

54
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:58,154
<i>The reality is harsh</i>

55
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:00,264
<i>Alteration... alteration... alteration...</i>

56
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:03,099
<i>Everything is going to be altered...!</i>

57
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,878
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

58
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,106
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

59
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:11,275
<i>Even in a sad scenario</i>

60
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:14,512
<i>I am going to rewrite
everything, everything</i>

61
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:17,030
<i>Because, because,
I am a princess</i>

62
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,241
<i>At least of my own story</i>

63
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,452
<i>I must enjoy it as much as possible</i>

64
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,539
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

65
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,917
<i>I have to live with
all my strength</i>

66
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:31,127
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

67
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,420
<i>Just wait and see!</i>

68
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,076
<i>I shall alter my own destiny!</i>

69
00:03:42,491 --> 00:03:45,209
<i>A goddess! A saint! Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

70
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,794
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

71
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,924
But, that makes sense.

72
00:03:52,216 --> 00:03:55,637
In both of the rebellions
in the Empire and Remno Kingdom

73
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:58,764
Sunkland was always
the one who profits.

74
00:04:00,245 --> 00:04:04,979
If that's so, all the things
that led me to the guillotine,

75
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,982
was actually caused by
the people who judged me?!

76
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:17,199
This feels like the time when I
was forced to bow and apologize...

77
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:22,162
It doesn't feel nice
to look at it at all...

78
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:26,291
I wonder what Prince Abel would do?

79
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,672
Strictly speaking, the one who brought
this to Remno Kingdom is not Sion himself,

80
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,883
and the one who has to be
responsible is the king of Sunkland.

81
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,512
But, it'll go against
Sion's conscience.

82
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:43,684
Besides, Prince Abel also has
all the rights to condemn Sion...

83
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:47,855
Raise your head, Prince Sion.

84
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,398
But...

85
00:04:49,773 --> 00:04:53,277
Royals have their own ways
of taking responsibility.

86
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:58,323
What we have to do,
is govern for the sake of people.

87
00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:03,787
And to do that, I thought I had to
suppress this war by using military power.

88
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:08,584
But, there was someone who showed me
a way to stop this conflict.

89
00:05:09,752 --> 00:05:12,796
A way to end this ridiculous battle.

90
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,884
There was someone who shone a light
on the path that we should take.

91
00:05:18,135 --> 00:05:22,055
If that's so, what we need to do
is just walk down that path.

92
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:23,932
Don't you agree?

93
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,235
Even if I bow down,
and ask for forgiveness,

94
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:36,568
it only serves my
self-satisfaction.

95
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,822
...is what you're saying, huh...

96
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:40,574
We were saved, both you and me.

97
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:44,870
We just need to walk the path that
the Wisdom of the Empire has shown.

98
00:05:45,662 --> 00:05:48,625
Seems like you managed
to forgive him, that's great.

99
00:05:48,626 --> 00:05:52,796
Well, to be honest, I can't really
say that my dad is free of guilt too.

100
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:55,422
I can't just put
all the blame on Sunkland.

101
00:05:55,881 --> 00:05:57,883
Mia, it's all thanks to you.

102
00:05:59,227 --> 00:06:01,054
I'm glad.

103
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:02,764
But really...

104
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:07,226
Sion, so you finally learned
the taste of failure.

105
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:10,646
Failure is normal
for humans after all.

106
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:13,815
No human is able to
live a perfect life.

107
00:06:14,149 --> 00:06:18,696
That's why, at the very least,
we all deserve a second chance.

108
00:06:19,424 --> 00:06:21,241
Especially me!

109
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:23,009
It's carved deep in Mia's heart,

110
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:29,332
that in the previous timeline, she wasn't
given any chance to redeem herself at all.

111
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:32,494
But if what happened
in Remno Kingdom this time

112
00:06:32,496 --> 00:06:35,588
were to happen in
the potential rebellion in the Empire,

113
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:40,634
I can't say this guy who'd act and stand
in the name of justice, is free of guilt.

114
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:45,056
If I think of it that way,
it made me a bit pissed.

115
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:48,725
In this situation, I think I can put
him through the wringer for a bit...

116
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,607
Sion, so that you won't forget this
failure, I'll carve it deep into you.

117
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,276
What do you mean?

118
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:02,531
When a mistake is punished,
that's when the case is closed.

119
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:05,568
Punishment?!
Hold on, Princess Mia!

120
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:07,578
No... She's right.

121
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,080
I'll comply and
receive the punishment.

122
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:11,915
What should I do?

123
00:07:12,374 --> 00:07:14,002
What a big heart you have!

124
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:16,712
If that's so,
please stand over there.

125
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:29,309
I have something that I've trained
myself so much, all this time.

126
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:34,605
Do you know? Your kicks aren't
painful at all, you know?

127
00:07:35,022 --> 00:07:38,317
The strength of the kick that
I've trained ever since that day!

128
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:41,528
I'll make it as
painful as it can be!

129
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:57,669
Go and carve it into your heart,
along with that pain, Sion!

130
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,298
It doesn't hurt at all...

131
00:08:01,873 --> 00:08:03,291
What is she doing...?

132
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,736
Don't tell me, it's on purpose?

133
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:11,141
To the public,
it looks like I was punished by that.

134
00:08:11,642 --> 00:08:16,897
But in reality, I'm the only one who knows
that I'm not receiving any punishment...

135
00:08:17,606 --> 00:08:21,735
And so, this crime, this
suffering, will never disappear.

136
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,906
From now on,
when I act in the name of justice,

137
00:08:24,907 --> 00:08:29,284
I'll have to rethink whether
I made the right decision or not.

138
00:08:29,868 --> 00:08:31,828
And then,
just like how I was forgiven,

139
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:36,758
I will rethink whether my enemy
should be forgiven or not too...

140
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:41,731
Carry out justice,
and behave righteously...

141
00:08:42,173 --> 00:08:44,189
Those words were taught
to me since childhood.

142
00:08:44,508 --> 00:08:48,970
The real meaning, the weight of it,
and the difficulty...

143
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,264
This is the first time
I've experienced it.

144
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,726
Um, Sion?

145
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:55,727
Mia, I'm grateful.

146
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:58,730
You really are the Wisdom of the Empire.

147
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:03,610
He got kicked and thanked me
instead, what the heck?

148
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:08,240
If you didn't say it to me,
I'm sure I wouldn't have figured it out.

149
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,952
Figure it out? About what?

150
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:12,954
What did he figure out?

151
00:09:12,955 --> 00:09:15,139
Besides, he mentioned
the Wisdom of the Empire...

152
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,350
A kick has nothing to do with wisdom!

153
00:09:17,351 --> 00:09:20,545
Does he mean that strength
and angle are important in a kick?

154
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:26,483
Since I'm good at it, what if he
asked me to do a kick another time?

155
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:29,803
I, I see, that's great then...

156
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:34,808
By the way, do you know where
Prime Minister Dasayev is being held?

157
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:39,521
According to my intel, he's being
monitored in a city called Senia.

158
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:44,860
Prince Abel,
do you know where this is?

159
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:49,489
No, but there might be someone
among the soldiers who knows.

160
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,578
If that's so,
isn't better to just ask Lynsha?

161
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:54,661
Lynsha?

162
00:09:55,049 --> 00:09:58,832
Actually, I became acquainted with
the sister of the rebel army leader...

163
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:00,165
I see...

164
00:10:00,535 --> 00:10:02,210
So you've even done that much...

165
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:07,774
Sorry, but do you mind if we
go with that retainer of yours?

166
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:13,180
I don't want to tell Bernard yet
that Sunkland is involved in this...

167
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:17,226
Well...
I won't say that I mind, but...

168
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:18,264
This situation...

169
00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:22,481
I'll end up having to go too, as if that's
the most natural thing to do, right?

170
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:25,942
Fine, fine, I get it already...

171
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,490
We're here.

172
00:10:31,948 --> 00:10:33,867
The mansion on that map is here.

173
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:44,002
The culprit that caused so much pain
to me, is inside this building...

174
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,381
It's fine...

175
00:10:49,424 --> 00:10:51,384
I'm sure it'll be okay.

176
00:10:57,246 --> 00:11:02,729
Damn! It should've been the perfect
time to cause chaos in the Empire!

177
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:05,399
Yet that Wisdom of the Empire...

178
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,943
It's all because of
that Mia Luna Tearmoon!

179
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,399
Starting from the ruin of the Empire,

180
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:12,698
then a systematic collapse
of other countries...

181
00:11:12,699 --> 00:11:15,284
Then comes chaos from
the collapse of order...

182
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:17,285
That's our dearest wish...

183
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:20,580
I won't let a little girl
bother us even further!

184
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:23,459
Everyone in the building!

185
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,043
Drop your weapon and come out!

186
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,671
My name is Sion Sol Sunkland!

187
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:30,674
The white crow's scheme
has come to light!

188
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:33,009
There's no reason
for you to fight!

189
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:37,348
To think that he'll shout
before we break and enter...

190
00:11:37,349 --> 00:11:39,725
Will this really be okay?

191
00:11:39,726 --> 00:11:43,479
I have a bad feeling about this,
but I hope it's just my imagination...

192
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,650
The bad feeling Mia had,
unexpectedly wasn't correct.

193
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:48,650
Let's go!

194
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,780
The Prince that they served
turns into an enemy,

195
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:57,994
and against strong people whom
they can't ever dream of beating,

196
00:11:57,995 --> 00:12:04,057
the enemies lost the will to fight
and came out of the mansion one by one.

197
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,712
Seems like things will go well.

198
00:12:07,713 --> 00:12:11,173
Miss Mia,
your hair looks rough...

199
00:12:11,174 --> 00:12:13,759
Yeah,
the shampoo here wasn't good,

200
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,839
the one I received from
Prince Abel is more slippery...

201
00:12:18,193 --> 00:12:20,390
Don't worry, Princess Mia!

202
00:12:21,057 --> 00:12:23,768
Here! I've brought it with me!

203
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,773
That's wonderful, Anne!

204
00:12:27,774 --> 00:12:33,045
I was planning to enjoy myself in
the bath once this battle was over!

205
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:35,698
I have one more thing
to look forward to now!

206
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:39,939
Mia said the lines no one should
ever say in a battlefield,

207
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,471
confidently, and heartily.

208
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:48,059
Just right after her bad premonitions
didn't come true...

209
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:10,982
Look what we have here...
Princess Mia.

210
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:13,485
I'm honored to meet you.

211
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,385
Mia, are you okay?!

212
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,637
So you're Jem...

213
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:29,434
I see, so the speech
just now was true.

214
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:32,729
That's right.
Your comrades have surrendered.

215
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,355
Stop your meaningless
resistance.

216
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,881
We've saved Prime Minister
Dasayev Donovan as well!

217
00:13:38,883 --> 00:13:40,737
You're the only one left now.

218
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:48,035
To think that you found a way
to the underground dungeon...

219
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:53,374
It's not just Prince Sion, but your
retainer is better than the rumors too...

220
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,881
Let's have you stop
moving, okay?

221
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:00,090
Mia!

222
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:02,342
Don't do anything stupid.

223
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:06,221
It's easy for me to just
cut off your head, you know?

224
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:07,848
Stop with this lunacy.

225
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:11,602
Sunkland won't protect both the
Wind Crow and the White Crow.

226
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:14,645
Your plans are already foiled!

227
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:19,567
Please don't be
such a killjoy, Prince Sion.

228
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,947
It might shock me and make me
lose my grip, you know?

229
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,592
In any case,

230
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:30,828
this girl is the one who destroyed
the plans we spent time and effort on.

231
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,456
She's the target of our grudge!

232
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,675
Even if you're the Wisdom of the Empire,
you're just a brat in the end.

233
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:45,551
What an embarrassment.

234
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:50,723
Seeing something leaking from Mia's skirt,
everyone had the same thought.

235
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:55,394
"Ah, Mia is so scared she
ended up soiling herself".

236
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,377
But, there's one person...

237
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:01,400
One person who realized
that it's something else.

238
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,029
No! This smell is...

239
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,492
Princess Mia! Run!

240
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,039
This brat!

241
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,649
I didn't expect the princess would be
the one who deals the finishing blow...

242
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:45,904
And so, one of the masterminds,
Jem, was defeated.

243
00:15:45,905 --> 00:15:51,660
The one who ended the incident was the
Wisdom of the Empire, Mia Luna Tearmoon,

244
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:55,831
And her brilliant kick
delivered by her delicate legs.

245
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,269
Prince Abel, Prince Sion...

246
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,675
I have a request.

247
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:09,469
These people...

248
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,597
Can you at least
spare their lives?

249
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:18,520
Normally, they won't accept
a wish to spare someone's life...

250
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:21,772
But, these two princes
thought at the same time.

251
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,608
I knew it.

252
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,860
That's what Mia wants.

253
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,572
Those people from the intelligence...

254
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:33,117
Even if I can persuade everyone,
the most lenient is a deportation...

255
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:38,456
But the ones in trouble are those locals
who are involved in the rebellion...

256
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,294
Both Lynsha and her brother, Lambert,
will most probably be executed.

257
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,297
Mia gave her best effort.

258
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:52,637
If that's so, I should use all
my power to answer her wish too.

259
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,348
But that's hard...

260
00:16:55,973 --> 00:17:00,394
If Remno Kingdom gave a light
punishment like deportation,

261
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,482
it'll be hard for Sunkland to
give them capital punishment too.

262
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,900
They'll end up suspecting that
we did that to cover our tracks.

263
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:10,780
Well, for that part, let's have
Prince Abel do some reminding too...

264
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,366
The problem is how to
deal with these people...

265
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:16,369
I wonder what Mia has in mind.

266
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,954
Are you serious about
not executing us?

267
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,542
Are you to put us
through torture instead?

268
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:25,378
Don't think that we'll tell you
everything that easily though!

269
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,921
Torture...

270
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,175
So the Princess thinks that something
is still being hidden by them...

271
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:36,138
But, as he said, I don't think
they'll just admit that easily.

272
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,557
So Princess,
what are you thinking?

273
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:45,690
It goes without saying, but it's not like
Mia was sympathizing with the culprits.

274
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:53,447
What if they're given a second chance
at life like me? Is that possible?

275
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,409
If it is, then what are the triggers?

276
00:17:57,228 --> 00:17:58,928
I don't know for sure...

277
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:06,169
I don't know, but maybe, getting killed
in the same place and time as last time...

278
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:12,174
Or maybe, getting beheaded by the
guillotine, or dying with regrets...

279
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:15,136
If these people from this
conspiracy got executed...

280
00:18:15,138 --> 00:18:17,431
There's a lot of chances
that might happen, right?

281
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:18,515
In any case...

282
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:22,286
If these people were killed, and
receive a second chance just like me...

283
00:18:22,288 --> 00:18:31,211
All the effort I made to alter the history
until now might go to waste!

284
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,907
There's no way I'm
getting guillotined again!

285
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:43,205
That's the feeling that moved Mia
ever since she was reincarnated.

286
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:44,291
But...

287
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:49,129
Mia realized that there was another
strong emotion welling up in her.

288
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,339
That's not the only reason.

289
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,926
I like the present, this timeline.

290
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,221
I mean, Sion who used to be my enemy,

291
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,516
his retainer, Keithwood,

292
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:04,869
Tiona,

293
00:19:06,036 --> 00:19:08,689
Dion, who chopped my head off,

294
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,401
Abel, who was just like anyone else,

295
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,280
Chloe,
who helped me all the way here,

296
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,896
Rafina...

297
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:22,954
and then Anne and Ludwig...

298
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,335
Just a short while ago, I was all alone...

299
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:32,922
But, my world right now
feels so warm...

300
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,842
If I can, I'd like to stay
by everyone's side forever...

301
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:41,640
But don't get me wrong, Sion, Tiona!

302
00:19:41,641 --> 00:19:46,018
It's not like I like you guys now, okay?

303
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:52,577
Abel, I know it will
cause you problems, but...

304
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:53,880
Yeah, I understand.

305
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,988
I'll persuade my dad, somehow.

306
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:02,326
But, even if we managed to save them from
execution, what should we do with them?

307
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,497
Hey, are you seriously
thinking of letting us live?

308
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,167
Are you some kind of saint?

309
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:12,586
He's starting to piss me off...

310
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,384
Oh, right!
How about we leave them to Rafina...

311
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:22,305
And have her scold them
for three years every day?

312
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,974
Are you ready?

313
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:26,892
That's nice.

314
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,979
How naive...

315
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,982
Stop messing around!

316
00:20:31,984 --> 00:20:33,984
That's just ridiculous!

317
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:39,321
But I thought you said we can
torture, or do anything to you?

318
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,868
The truth is,
this decision from Mia

319
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:49,163
will become the first step to uncover
a lying darkness in the future,

320
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:51,458
But that's a story
for another time.

321
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:55,752
And so, the rebellion in
Remno Kingdom finally ends...

322
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:02,679
Then, Ludwig and Tiona
who understood Mia, went to the capital,

323
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,932
and Lambert and Lynsha
whom they worried about

324
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:09,644
were treated warmly, along with the
other core members of the rebellion army.

325
00:21:09,645 --> 00:21:15,441
After she subdued the rebellion without
trouble, Mia went back to the academy.

326
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,696
Well! Well, well, well!

327
00:21:19,697 --> 00:21:22,741
What a wonderful sight!

328
00:21:22,742 --> 00:21:24,618
This was all prepared by Anne?

329
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:30,415
Yes! I gave my all for
today's tea party preparation!

330
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,750
I see...

331
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:35,352
This is from me!

332
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,467
I feel like I've seen this before...

333
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:42,344
She didn't roast it outside this time,
and she used a proper stove.

334
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:44,679
The saltiness is perfect too!

335
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,182
Well done, Riora!

336
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:50,976
Sweetness and saltiness
bring an infinite loop of happiness!

337
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,979
I brought various kinds of tea!

338
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,194
What a nice smell...

339
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:00,736
Oh right, Rafina.

340
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,324
I'm really sorry to push
all that trouble to you...

341
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:06,659
Ah, those people...

342
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,288
Just as Mia suggested,
we're giving them sermons every day.

343
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,713
Oh! This is really delicious!

344
00:22:18,714 --> 00:22:20,172
Abel, try it too!

345
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,509
You have something on your face.

346
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,267
Is something wrong?

347
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:39,900
I'm just so happy drinking tea
with everyone like this.

348
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:42,277
That's right.

349
00:22:54,373 --> 00:23:01,880
The future is still not set, and no one
knows what kind of life awaits Mia...

350
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:05,718
But, I want to have more
and more happiness in my life.

351
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:12,057
But, the fact that Mia will never give in
remains unchanged.

352
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:18,063
For the sake of her happiness,
and those she holds dear to her...

353
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,917
This is a redo story of a Princess,

354
00:23:20,918 --> 00:23:23,819
who slightly put herself
first over anything else.

355
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:29,491
How will the seeds of hope that
she sowed color her future...

356
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,786
No one knows that yet.
