1
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:07,408
It's already recess, huh?

2
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:10,619
Her name is Chloe Forkroad.

3
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:14,415
Her parents developed a small
caravan merchant into a big company,

4
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:18,460
and they're good at communications that
even noble gather with them, but...

5
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,131
This is my last book...

6
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:24,591
What should I do tomorrow?

7
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:29,054
Maybe I should find the
courage to talk to someone?

8
00:00:32,993 --> 00:00:38,273
I-I hope you are doing
well, I am Chloe...

9
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,818
There is no way I can do that!

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,655
I would rather disappear.

11
00:00:49,032 --> 00:00:51,577
Hey, can I have a moment?

12
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,914
Princess Mia!?

13
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:01,296
Yeah, you are the only
daughter of the Forkroad Firm,

14
00:01:01,297 --> 00:01:03,673
Chloe Forkroad, Right?

15
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,965
Yes!

16
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:11,222
It seems that you read a lot of books.
Do you also read stories?

17
00:01:11,223 --> 00:01:13,890
Ah, yes, I do.

18
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:17,769
But I already finished reading
all the books I have...

19
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:22,065
I was just looking
for a person like you!

20
00:01:22,357 --> 00:01:24,985
Would you like to
be friends with me?

21
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,949
Mia-sama is the most
powerful person in the class.

22
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:35,162
Why does she came to
a plain girl like me?

23
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:37,748
I see...

24
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:43,045
She took a pity on me
because I am always alone.

25
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:45,923
But I...

26
00:01:46,256 --> 00:01:48,008
I don't really like it...

27
00:01:50,928 --> 00:01:53,013
Why me?

28
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:56,141
Because you like books!

29
00:01:57,434 --> 00:02:00,563
I am looking for a book-buddy.

30
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:01,855
Book... Buddy?

31
00:02:02,147 --> 00:02:05,984
Actually, I have something
I want you to read.

32
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:12,491
It's kind of a shame that
only me and Anne read it!

33
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,494
Is it okay for me to read this?

34
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:16,913
Of course!

35
00:02:16,914 --> 00:02:20,582
Would you please
be my book-buddy?

36
00:02:25,087 --> 00:02:26,672
If you are fine with me, then...

37
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:32,939
In the previous timeline this
friendship didn't happen...

38
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:38,117
Chloe will be of
big help for Mia later on,

39
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:41,436
But Mia doesn't know
it yet at that time.

40
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,233
<i>A goddess! A saint!
Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

41
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:47,485
<i>Kindness! Fraternity!
That is it!</i>

42
00:02:47,486 --> 00:02:50,196
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

43
00:02:50,197 --> 00:02:53,491
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

44
00:02:53,492 --> 00:02:55,576
<i>I am!</i>

45
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,708
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going
through as a helpless princess</i>

46
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:03,084
<i>If that's what you
thought, then go ahead!?</i>

47
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:05,753
<i>The world is always dependent
on the direction of wind</i>

48
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:08,548
<i>There are too many useless
things and people, seriously</i>

49
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:11,301
<i>I can't believe in anybody</i>

50
00:03:11,302 --> 00:03:14,012
<i>I have noticed
that, the world is</i>

51
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:16,806
<i>so heartless</i>

52
00:03:16,807 --> 00:03:18,224
<i>That is not good,
This is not good</i>

53
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:19,601
<i>It is not good,
everything is not good</i>

54
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:21,060
<i>The reality is harsh</i>

55
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:23,021
<i>Alteration...
alteration...alteration...</i>

56
00:03:23,022 --> 00:03:25,481
<i>Everything is going
to be altered...!</i>

57
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:28,693
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

58
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:31,988
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

59
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:34,157
<i>Even in a sad scenario</i>

60
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:37,410
<i>I am going to rewrite
everything, everything</i>

61
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:39,704
<i>Because, because,
I am a princess</i>

62
00:03:39,705 --> 00:03:42,957
<i>At least of my own story</i>

63
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,251
<i>I must enjoy it as
much as possible</i>

64
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:48,546
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

65
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:50,840
<i>I have to live with
all my strength</i>

66
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:54,093
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

67
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:55,470
<i>Just wait and see!</i>

68
00:03:55,471 --> 00:04:00,098
<i>I shall alter my own destiny!</i>

69
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:07,940
<i>A goddess! A saint!
Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

70
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:10,984
<i>Kindness! Fraternity!
That is it!</i>

71
00:04:12,444 --> 00:04:16,991
But Mia-sama, I didn't know
that you are such a book lover.

72
00:04:16,992 --> 00:04:18,409
Is that so?

73
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,703
If only there's a book club,

74
00:04:20,704 --> 00:04:23,705
we'd be able to gather
more book lovers.

75
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,000
Club?

76
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:30,837
Pardon my intrusion.

77
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,217
In case there's a revolt,

78
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:40,681
I'll need to be able to ride a horse,
so that I can escape swiftly.

79
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:44,936
In that case,
I should enroll in equestrian club.

80
00:04:44,937 --> 00:04:48,773
Oh my, what kind of business could
you possibly have here, young lady?

81
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:51,191
You are...

82
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,030
Ahhh, sorry for the last time.

83
00:04:57,322 --> 00:05:00,326
I am a senior second year and the
president of the horse-riding club,

84
00:05:00,327 --> 00:05:01,618
Lin Malong.

85
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:04,287
I am Mia Luna Tearmoon.

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,252
Judging by your name,
are you from the Equestrian Kingdom?

87
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:14,172
It is an honor to be known
by Tearmoon Empire Princess.

88
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:16,425
So, what brings you here today?

89
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:22,976
Don't tell me that you are here
to put that horse down, right?

90
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,058
Put down?

91
00:05:25,767 --> 00:05:28,562
Well, it ruined your dress, right?

92
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:32,441
Ahh, that's not a big deal.

93
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:34,068
Between dress and horse,

94
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:37,279
it's quite clear which is
a more valuable existence.

95
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:40,157
That's right!

96
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:43,744
You can't run away from
revolutionary army with a dress,

97
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,788
But, that's not the case with a horse!

98
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,444
Leaving that aside,
if I enroll in the equestrian club,

99
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:52,961
Will I able to learn
how to ride a horse?

100
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:54,504
Yes, of course...

101
00:05:55,046 --> 00:05:58,091
But why would a princess
wants to ride a horse?

102
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:04,806
That's because a horse
can take me far, far away.

103
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:08,185
That's right!

104
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:12,607
As far away as possible
from the revolutionary army!

105
00:06:12,608 --> 00:06:14,856
Her words...

106
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:18,446
Those words won't come from someone
who sees horses as a mere tool of war,

107
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:20,405
Or a mere trophy pet!

108
00:06:20,906 --> 00:06:24,951
I guess there is more to this
princess than meets the eye.

109
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:30,166
Mia's words had resonated with
something within Malong's heart.

110
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,809
Princess Mia?

111
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,795
Prince Abel!

112
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:41,092
Perhaps Prince Abel also
enrolled in equestrian club?

113
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:44,722
Well, more or less, I am also a
prince of Remno Kingdom after all.

114
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:48,431
So, I'm thinking of honing my
skills for fencing and horse-riding.

115
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:49,935
I see...

116
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:56,316
In that past,
Prince Abel was in a card games club...

117
00:06:56,775 --> 00:06:58,985
By the way, Princess Mia,
why are you here?

118
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:03,573
I am also interested in equestrian,
so I came to check it out.

119
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,660
Abel, you know each other?

120
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:08,788
If that's the case
then it's perfect.

121
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:10,497
Why don't you take her
for a ride with you?

122
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,876
She came all the way here
to check us out, you know? Right?

123
00:07:15,085 --> 00:07:18,063
B-but... That's...

124
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:21,968
Oh my...
Prince Abel, are you flustered?

125
00:07:22,937 --> 00:07:25,136
Surprisingly you are quite shy, huh.

126
00:07:26,346 --> 00:07:30,768
Prince Abel,
I also request you to escort me.

127
00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:33,436
If Princess Mia says so..

128
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:37,483
Since I am the grown up
here, I will take the lead,

129
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:40,652
and show you the
composure of an adult.

130
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,991
This is way too high!

131
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:48,303
The "adult composure"
didn't last long.

132
00:07:48,304 --> 00:07:49,829
Alright, let's go now!

133
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,296
Hold on to me tightly..

134
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,141
Princess Mia,
you don't have to hold me that tightly!

135
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,171
I know that, this is nothing!

136
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:06,970
Princess Mia,
open your eyes and take a look.

137
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:10,682
Scenery from atop of a horse
is quite beautiful.

138
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:13,685
Yeah, you are quite right.

139
00:08:17,814 --> 00:08:18,898
Oh my!!

140
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,483
It's not scary anymore, right?

141
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,653
Yeah, it's really soothing.

142
00:08:24,608 --> 00:08:26,506
P-Princess!!
What are you doing?!

143
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,244
Ah, look,
your maid is also here!

144
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:32,538
Oh, yeah, you're right.

145
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:34,473
Anne!

146
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:36,891
Princess! Keep on holding to me!

147
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:45,735
Ah... It doesn't hurt...?

148
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:46,760
Ouch...

149
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,430
Are you alright, Princess Mia?

150
00:08:50,993 --> 00:08:52,432
Prince Abel?!

151
00:08:53,058 --> 00:08:54,977
Why am I being so flustered?

152
00:08:54,978 --> 00:09:00,524
We hugged each other during the ball,
and nothing happened, right?

153
00:09:00,525 --> 00:09:03,235
Moreover,
Prince Abel is still a child!

154
00:09:03,236 --> 00:09:05,570
He is 8 years younger than me!

155
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:07,740
That's why... It's...

156
00:09:07,741 --> 00:09:08,940
Princess Mia?

157
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:11,326
Are you hurt somewhere?

158
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:16,665
Don't look at me
with those eyes!

159
00:09:16,998 --> 00:09:20,670
I am alright now,
so can you please move away from me?

160
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:23,697
Ah, sorry! That was rude of me..

161
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,592
Please don't misunderstand me,
Prince Abel!

162
00:09:28,134 --> 00:09:32,597
I'm not saying that I don't
like being held by you.

163
00:09:33,431 --> 00:09:35,976
Yes, I know..

164
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:41,606
What is this prickly
feeling in my heart?

165
00:09:42,302 --> 00:09:45,361
Most probably I am panicking
because if he hates me,

166
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:48,530
He won't be sending any
reinforcements later!

167
00:09:48,697 --> 00:09:51,074
But, what should I do?

168
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:53,201
Yeah, that's right!

169
00:09:57,288 --> 00:10:02,127
Prince Abel, thank you so much
for saving me just now.

170
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:04,880
If you get closer to
people than necessary,

171
00:10:04,881 --> 00:10:06,881
naturally they are going
to distance themselves.

172
00:10:07,532 --> 00:10:09,969
And If I can get Prince Abel
to experience it as well,

173
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,803
maybe this misunderstanding
will be gone.

174
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:17,684
I get it so,
could you please move away a bit?

175
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:21,522
See, this time even you
turned your face away?

176
00:10:21,523 --> 00:10:22,897
That was because..

177
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:28,528
Earlier I also had the same feeling
which you are experiencing right now.

178
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:30,113
Same?

179
00:10:30,321 --> 00:10:32,283
Since I am a sensitive person,

180
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:35,785
I get nervous if someone
comes closer than necessary.

181
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:38,788
Yeah! That's all about it!

182
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:42,418
Mine and Princess Mia's
feelings are same?

183
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:44,295
Yes! They are same.

184
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:47,672
But, compared to yours,
my feelings are...

185
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,383
Stronger!

186
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,470
Oh my, you're a sore loser, aren't you?

187
00:10:53,845 --> 00:10:56,890
Are you telling me
you're more sensitive?

188
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:02,103
But Mia did not realize.

189
00:11:02,394 --> 00:11:07,192
That the reason of nervousness between
her and Abel were completely different.

190
00:11:07,194 --> 00:11:11,489
And neither did she realize that
why she really got flustered,

191
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:14,199
was because she's approached by
a boy who she's interested in.

192
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:24,918
I was able to get in horse-riding club
and also made a book-buddy.

193
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:28,630
With this momentum, I'm pretty sure
I've avoided the guillotine...

194
00:11:30,163 --> 00:11:32,759
Yep,
I still can't avoid it at all...

195
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:36,805
Mia-sama, have you heard?

196
00:11:37,013 --> 00:11:41,267
There will be a fencing
tournament in the academy soon.

197
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,228
Fencing tournament?

198
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,815
Yes,
maids were all noisy about it.

199
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:48,734
And in this tournament,

200
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:53,781
girls preparing lunchbox for the boy
that they like has become a custom.

201
00:11:54,664 --> 00:11:56,116
A lunchbox...

202
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:59,344
A lunchbox!?

203
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:07,919
Prince Sion, I will make you say that you
won because of the lunchbox I gave you!

204
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:14,384
Nah, I don't need it.
Just go home.

205
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,514
Just why?

206
00:12:18,515 --> 00:12:22,226
Even though I prepared such
an exquisite lunchbox for him!

207
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:25,145
And this is what you
call a solitary meal.

208
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:30,109
Mi..Mia-sama!?

209
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,862
No, it's nothing.

210
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:36,157
I've had enough of
such lonesome memories.

211
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:37,074
That's right!

212
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:40,828
Unlike that stupid Sion,
Prince Abel is a gentleman,

213
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:43,079
So he will surely eat
the meal that I prepare!

214
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,457
Prince Abel.

215
00:12:46,332 --> 00:12:48,960
Princess Mia,
are you practicing too today?

216
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:50,795
Yeah, kind of.

217
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:54,716
For now, I should make a
promise first in advance.

218
00:12:55,133 --> 00:13:00,680
I see. Even Malong was praising
you for taking this seriously.

219
00:13:00,972 --> 00:13:02,724
That is an honor.

220
00:13:03,466 --> 00:13:05,863
If it's okay with you, would you
like take a ride together again?

221
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:08,730
Well then,
I'd like to take your offer...

222
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:14,652
Your palm got quite hard.

223
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:16,321
Yeah..

224
00:13:16,738 --> 00:13:21,075
I was actually practicing for the
upcoming swordsmanship tournament.

225
00:13:21,242 --> 00:13:23,119
Prince Abel...

226
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,830
You're really working hard, huh.

227
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:36,050
Price Abel,
it's about the day of the tournament,

228
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:36,580
Yeah?

229
00:13:37,091 --> 00:13:42,723
Do you have anyone who will
be making a lunchbox for you?

230
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:44,808
No, no one in particular.

231
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:49,271
If that's the case,
will you let me prepare one for you?

232
00:13:49,272 --> 00:13:51,189
You will prepare one for me?

233
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:56,461
Yeah... I'll prepare my best
lunchbox so that you can win.

234
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,696
Thank you, Princess Mia.

235
00:14:01,783 --> 00:14:04,369
Now I won't have
to be lonely again.

236
00:14:04,702 --> 00:14:10,166
Now then it's decided,
without any delay let's go and order one.

237
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:15,318
We can't really take
an order for that day.

238
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:18,546
The order should be made at least
one week before the tournament,

239
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:20,992
it's the same everywhere.

240
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:26,015
What the heck!?

241
00:14:26,349 --> 00:14:27,768
I see...

242
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:31,313
So all the stores are fully
booked, huh...

243
00:14:31,314 --> 00:14:34,108
What should I do now?

244
00:14:34,109 --> 00:14:35,693
If that's the case then...

245
00:14:35,694 --> 00:14:37,068
Let's prepare one ourselves!!

246
00:14:37,694 --> 00:14:38,736
Huh?

247
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:43,324
Mia-sama will prepare one for Prince
Abel, by yourself!

248
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:47,496
But, I have never
cooked anything before.

249
00:14:47,497 --> 00:14:49,123
I will also help!

250
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:54,352
And men are happy to have a
hand-cooked meal from women!

251
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:56,479
I see...

252
00:14:56,713 --> 00:14:59,674
By the way Anne,
are you good at cooking?

253
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,054
If it's bread,
I guess I have baked it once.

254
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,891
Ah! this is no good!

255
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:13,688
Sensing the danger,
Mia decided to ask for help.

256
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:15,648
Cooking, is it?

257
00:15:16,024 --> 00:15:19,445
Yeah, I thought you'd
be familiar with it.

258
00:15:19,446 --> 00:15:22,448
Yeah. If it's cooking,
I know about it.

259
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:24,450
I have read it in a book before.

260
00:15:24,451 --> 00:15:27,702
Know about it?
Read it in a book?

261
00:15:28,369 --> 00:15:31,789
But, what other options
do I have here?

262
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,169
Actually,
I was thinking about preparing

263
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,812
a lunchbox for the tournament.

264
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:39,673
I was wondering if you'll
be able to join me.

265
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:43,469
I don't think I have any
other plans in that day..

266
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,095
If that's the case,
please join me.

267
00:15:45,096 --> 00:15:47,472
Alright!
Secured a helping hand for now.

268
00:15:49,265 --> 00:15:52,311
Let's check,
so Anne and Chloe...

269
00:15:52,312 --> 00:15:55,396
Who else can I rely on...

270
00:15:56,022 --> 00:15:59,401
I can't think of anyone else!!

271
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:01,882
We just started and
I'm already stuck!!

272
00:16:01,883 --> 00:16:04,865
Mia-sama, I found someone
who is good at cooking!

273
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:09,678
For real?
Take me to that person, now!

274
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:14,040
Mia-sama, how can I help you?

275
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,719
Huh?
Anne, by someone who can cook,

276
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,710
Don't tell me...

277
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:23,341
Yes, Tiona-sama will
surely be of help!

278
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,722
She is my grudge target,
the one who sent me to the Guillotine.

279
00:16:28,723 --> 00:16:32,058
I don't want to interact
with her as much as possible!

280
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:36,939
Miss Tiona, I heard that
you are good at cooking...

281
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,943
Yes, we have big and good
agricultural lands after all!

282
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:44,321
It seems I can
expect something good now.

283
00:16:44,322 --> 00:16:46,490
I was always cutting
the vegetables,

284
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:48,367
so Julienning vegetable
is my expertise.

285
00:16:48,368 --> 00:16:51,761
Umm,
what about the other things?

286
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,039
I am also perfect
at fine chopping,

287
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,891
and I'm good at peeling too!

288
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:58,459
It's pretty worrying...

289
00:16:59,043 --> 00:17:02,755
But beggars can't be choosers!

290
00:17:03,256 --> 00:17:06,844
Ms. Tiona,
on the day of the tournament,

291
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:11,765
I will be preparing a lunchbox for
Prince Abel, would you like to join me?

292
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,267
Someone like me
will be joining you, Princess?

293
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:19,147
Besides, I don't have anyone
to prepare lunchbox for...

294
00:17:19,564 --> 00:17:21,566
If that's the case
then, for that idio...

295
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:26,613
Why don't you prepare
one for Prince Sion?

296
00:17:26,614 --> 00:17:28,031
For Prince Sion?

297
00:17:28,032 --> 00:17:29,908
Yes, for him.

298
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:35,347
If the meal turned out bad,
Prince Abel might not have a good meal,

299
00:17:35,348 --> 00:17:38,792
and he might not be
able to get good results because of it.

300
00:17:38,793 --> 00:17:41,144
But, if Prince Sion
eats the same thing,

301
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:43,714
we would be able to
drag him down too!

302
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:48,634
Mia planned a pointless thing.

303
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,650
You're working hard, Your Highness.

304
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,068
Keithwood?

305
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,492
You are good at hiding your
presence, as usual.

306
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:16,727
I wonder just how many girls have
fallen victim to his gestures already?

307
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,623
Huh? Did you say something?

308
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:20,082
Nope. Nothing at all.

309
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,894
By the way, have you already
decided on the person

310
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:25,047
who will be preparing
a lunchbox for you?

311
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,509
No,
I turned down all the offers.

312
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:34,597
Does that mean you want
to have a lunchbox prepared by me?

313
00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:36,266
That might be it,

314
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:38,309
It's not bad to have one
of yours once in a while.

315
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,811
You used to prepare them
in the past as well.

316
00:18:41,479 --> 00:18:46,192
For Your Highness, I had to sneak into
the kitchen and prepare late night snacks.

317
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:50,571
And because of that you got cavities
and we both were scolded, right.

318
00:18:54,629 --> 00:18:58,622
Well, jokes apart, I assume that you've
planned something for lunch, right?

319
00:18:58,623 --> 00:19:00,206
Hmm? Well..

320
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,711
As the crowned prince
of the Sunkland kingdom,

321
00:19:04,712 --> 00:19:07,881
if he receives a lunchbox from
just any one in particular,

322
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:11,050
it may become a disadvantage
for the country in future.

323
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,680
Hmm?
Do you want to say something?

324
00:19:14,681 --> 00:19:16,347
No, nothing in particular.

325
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:22,687
He's not wrong, but would it kill
him to ease up once in a while?

326
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:26,525
Well then,
good luck with your training.

327
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:27,188
Yeah.

328
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:32,406
His highness was said that,

329
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:36,492
but he might be a bit sad not to
receive any lunchboxes from anyone.

330
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:42,415
Speaking of which, there are only limited
people he can receive lunchbox from.

331
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:46,043
When it comes to Sunkland and the
other countries on par with...

332
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:49,338
As I thought...

333
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,048
Mr. Keithwood!

334
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:52,293
Hm?

335
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,135
Just perfect timing.

336
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:59,182
Well, if it isn't Lady Rudolvon?
What can I do for you?

337
00:19:59,183 --> 00:20:00,933
Actually..

338
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:05,564
Oh, you're preparing
lunchbox with Princess Mia?

339
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:06,604
Yes.

340
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:11,236
And so, I want to ask whether it's okay
to give the lunchbox to Prince Sion?

341
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:12,737
I see.

342
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:17,074
It's a collaboration, and the receivers
will be Prince Sion and Abel...

343
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:21,203
Certainly, if it's done that way,
there won't be any troublesome rumors.

344
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,751
Mr. Keithwood?

345
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:29,711
Ah no, I understand.

346
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:32,130
I will relay your message to Prince Sion.

347
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:33,549
Thank you very much.

348
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,009
Well then...

349
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:40,598
As expected from Princess Mia,
yet another intricate plan...

350
00:20:41,057 --> 00:20:44,269
Again, the Wisdom of the Empire
lives up to her name.

351
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,233
But, what is with this strange
uneasiness and unpleasant premonition?

352
00:20:52,268 --> 00:20:54,070
A hand-made lunchbox?

353
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,867
Yeah, we'll make one for
Prince Abel and Prince Sion!

354
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,994
For Prince Sion as well...

355
00:21:02,453 --> 00:21:05,999
I'm sorry, but it will be
prepared by a bunch of amateurs,

356
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,502
so I don't think it'll
be as good as the stores.

357
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:15,549
With this, my defensive line is perfect
in case the meal turned out bad!

358
00:21:15,966 --> 00:21:18,594
On the contrary,
I am actually happy.

359
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:21,181
You'll be happy?

360
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:25,268
Yeah, my mother or my sister
used to prepare one for me back then,

361
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:27,062
and those made me really happy.

362
00:21:27,063 --> 00:21:30,106
That's why, thank you.
I am looking forward to it.

363
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,735
Wait? Doesn't that mean that
difficulty bar just got higher?

364
00:21:33,736 --> 00:21:35,236
We are here!

365
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:46,038
I didn't know that there's
such a beautiful place here!

366
00:21:47,623 --> 00:21:49,543
I am glad you liked it.

367
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,043
Watch your step.

368
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:57,024
Thank you.

369
00:22:02,847 --> 00:22:06,184
Walking along this beautiful lake
shore beside a gentleman...

370
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:09,563
It was unimaginable when I was
in that underground prison.

371
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:12,733
But still it is kind of sad.

372
00:22:12,734 --> 00:22:14,401
What is it?

373
00:22:14,402 --> 00:22:17,446
To think of that I won't be having
the lunchbox you make all to myself,

374
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:20,464
it makes me sad.

375
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,327
What the heck is this guy blurting out?

376
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:26,704
Airhead? Is he an airhead?

377
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:31,125
Are you fine?
If you are tired you can rest a bit.

378
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:37,423
Meanwhile,
I'll do some training with sword.

379
00:22:38,215 --> 00:22:39,633
Thank you.

380
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,311
You're very enthusiastic
about your training...

381
00:22:50,728 --> 00:22:55,858
Certainly, I have never swung
my sword this desperately.

382
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:59,571
But I have an opponent
I want to win against.

383
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:02,113
Opponent you want
to win against?

384
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:06,827
Yeah, that's why I'm relieved
about the lunchbox thing.

385
00:23:07,161 --> 00:23:09,955
Eh? What do you mean by that?

386
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:14,085
If I'm the only one
receiving your lunchbox,

387
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:18,589
people might say that I won against
Sion because I ate your lunchbox.

388
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:22,134
In other words, you mean...

389
00:23:23,093 --> 00:23:29,350
Mia's hand-made lunch is now being
expected to surpass the heavens.
