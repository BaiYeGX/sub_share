1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,196
Be careful on your way!

2
00:00:04,197 --> 00:00:05,730
Yeah!

3
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:09,367
We received such a
great help from him.

4
00:00:10,618 --> 00:00:12,037
What's wrong?

5
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:14,622
I hope Keithwood and the
others are safe as well.

6
00:00:14,997 --> 00:00:18,518
At least he has some
humanity left inside him.

7
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,644
It was kind of
unexpected though.

8
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,714
If we are attacked again,

9
00:00:22,715 --> 00:00:24,674
it's gonna be difficult
just by myself.

10
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,720
Err... I'll just ask about that...

11
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:31,723
What did you mean
that it'll be difficult?

12
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:35,101
I haven't killed a single
person in a battlefield before.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,579
In fact, it was my first
battle in real life.

14
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,354
What?

15
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:40,732
Of course,
I am gonna give all the efforts.

16
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:43,417
But unfortunately,
I can't guarantee your safety.

17
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:49,031
Keithwood, please be safe!!

18
00:00:49,477 --> 00:00:52,343
<i>A goddess! A saint!
Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

19
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,637
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

20
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:57,307
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

21
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:00,668
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

22
00:01:00,669 --> 00:01:02,669
<i>I am!</i>

23
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:08,902
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going
through as a helpless princess</i>

24
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,361
<i>If that's what you thought,
then go ahead!?</i>

25
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,113
<i>The world is always dependent
on the direction of wind</i>

26
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:15,783
<i>There are too many useless
things and people, seriously</i>

27
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,493
<i>I can't believe in anybody</i>

28
00:01:18,493 --> 00:01:21,204
<i>I have noticed that, the world is</i>

29
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:23,917
<i>so heartless</i>

30
00:01:23,918 --> 00:01:25,418
<i>That is not good,
This is not good</i>

31
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,586
<i>It is not good,
everything is not good</i>

32
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:28,188
<i>The reality is harsh</i>

33
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,298
<i>Alteration... alteration... alteration...</i>

34
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,133
<i>Everything is going to be altered...!</i>

35
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:35,912
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

36
00:01:35,913 --> 00:01:39,140
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

37
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:41,309
<i>Even in a sad scenario</i>

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,546
<i>I am going to rewrite
everything, everything</i>

39
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:47,064
<i>Because, because,
I am a princess</i>

40
00:01:47,064 --> 00:01:50,275
<i>At least of my own story</i>

41
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:52,486
<i>I must enjoy it as much as possible</i>

42
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:55,573
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

43
00:01:55,574 --> 00:01:57,951
<i>I have to live with
all my strength</i>

44
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:01,161
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

45
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:02,454
<i>Just wait and see!</i>

46
00:02:02,454 --> 00:02:07,110
<i>I shall alter my own destiny!</i>

47
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:15,243
<i>A goddess! A saint! Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

48
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:17,828
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

49
00:02:19,622 --> 00:02:24,353
I did hear that something disturbing
is going on in Remno Kingdom...

50
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:26,808
but I didn't expect that Princess Mia
herself is heading there.

51
00:02:26,809 --> 00:02:27,797
Yeah...

52
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:31,801
In a normal situation, I would have
dispatched the Princess Guards...

53
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,114
But if we move the army in this situation,
it'd be suspected for an invasion.

54
00:02:36,115 --> 00:02:37,432
Dion!

55
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:41,311
For God's sake, our princess
always puts us up in hard positions.

56
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:43,146
It's nothing to laugh about.

57
00:02:43,147 --> 00:02:45,190
What if something
happens to her?

58
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:49,502
The Sword-Genius, Prince Sion is with
her, I don't think we need to worry much.

59
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:51,363
It may be as you you say,

60
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:54,633
But Remno kingdom is not in a situation
where a revolt would happen.

61
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:56,409
What do you mean by that?

62
00:02:56,867 --> 00:03:00,080
People are discontent
with the rising tax,

63
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:03,500
But it's not to that level
where it can cause a revolution.

64
00:03:03,501 --> 00:03:04,876
So that means...

65
00:03:04,877 --> 00:03:08,233
Someone is trying to
forcibly cause a revolt.

66
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:10,648
Someone? Like who?

67
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:14,468
Either way, we have to stop it
before there's any blood shed.

68
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:20,951
But, isn't impossible to stop it
without casualty, even for our princess?

69
00:03:21,163 --> 00:03:25,980
Still, If it's Princess Mia,
she can do it for sure.

70
00:03:26,314 --> 00:03:29,985
Nevertheless, this part of
the kingdom is quite peaceful.

71
00:03:29,986 --> 00:03:32,629
Bandits doesn't
show up around here,

72
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,364
and it's a really good
place to do business for us.

73
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:38,076
But there is a civil war
going on, right?

74
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:40,369
But it's irrelevant here.

75
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:44,499
Though I heard that there was a revolt
in one of Earl Donovan's territory...

76
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,918
There is also a rumor
that they dispatched

77
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,230
the Diamond Legion
to put away that revolt.

78
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,714
Diamond Legion?

79
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:54,384
If that's the case then
there will be a massacre.

80
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,969
What is this Diamond Legion?

81
00:03:57,178 --> 00:04:00,222
It's an elite unit that the King
of Remno Kingdom personally formed.

82
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:03,352
Each of its warrior is
equal to a thousand,

83
00:04:03,353 --> 00:04:05,853
making this unit
the strongest heavy infantry.

84
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:08,690
That sounds really strong!

85
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:12,568
I wonder if I can scout a few
for my Imperial Guards.

86
00:04:12,972 --> 00:04:16,198
Though it's against a rebel army,
they are still citizens of this country.

87
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,493
To think they'd assign their mightiest
force just to suppress them.

88
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:24,121
So, how much was the
damage this time?

89
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:27,376
From what I heard,
there is not a single casualty yet.

90
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:27,958
Huh?

91
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:31,438
I heard they haven't
had a skirmish yet.

92
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:34,774
They are the Diamond Legion after all.

93
00:04:39,053 --> 00:04:40,530
No matter how I look at,

94
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,948
They're all just love letters!

95
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,407
His name is Graham.

96
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:47,896
A member of the the Sunkland Kingdom
secret intelligence group "Wind Crows".

97
00:04:47,897 --> 00:04:52,233
He is currently infiltrating the Remno
Kingdom government as a civilian official.

98
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:54,960
Prince Abel. How are you doing?

99
00:04:56,987 --> 00:04:58,823
No! There's no way.

100
00:04:59,073 --> 00:05:02,969
I'm sure she's communicating
with Abel somehow!

101
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,641
This plan to thrust Remno Kingdom
into riot was supposed to be done

102
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:11,628
after the fall of
the Tearmoon Empire.

103
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:15,564
It's all because of that Mia's fault!

104
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:18,093
Pardon my intrusion.

105
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,237
Monica?

106
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:23,824
Mr. Graham,
your monologues are way too loud.

107
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,934
So..what is it you want?

108
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:27,226
I'd like to report.

109
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:29,913
We let Princess Mia and
Prince Sion get away,

110
00:05:29,914 --> 00:05:34,046
when they attempted to
infiltrate across the borders.

111
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,029
We are also looking for
their of attendants,

112
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,588
But there are no details on it yet.

113
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:44,844
Don't tell me,
they predicted the assault?

114
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,531
I knew it, Prince Abel and
Princess Mia were communicating!

115
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:53,211
It just look like a normal conversation
between a teenage boy and a girl.

116
00:05:53,212 --> 00:05:54,335
No way!

117
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:58,942
If that's so, there was no need to
give her presents like a horse shampoo!

118
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:01,652
I am sure it was
some kind of code!

119
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:04,014
Like arranging a fast horse.

120
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,057
Are you sure you are not
reading into it too much?

121
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:08,221
He is reading way too much into it.

122
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:12,314
Anyway, plan to make
the Tearmoon Empire fall is a failure.

123
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:15,763
I don't care how,
we have to speed up this plan.

124
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:17,918
It's going fine at the moment.

125
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,821
But it's like walking on a rope.

126
00:06:19,822 --> 00:06:24,117
By circulating rumor of an
upright person, like Earl Donovan,

127
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:28,537
being confined by the king, they are
instigating people to cause a revolt.

128
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,375
As a result, the rebel army took
control of the town facilities,

129
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:36,878
And like they wanted, the anxious
king dispatched the Diamond Legion.

130
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,232
And if a mass slaughter
occurred here,

131
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,718
the fire of revolution will be
spread throughout the nation.

132
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,485
Or that's how it's supposed to be, but...

133
00:06:43,928 --> 00:06:45,513
Is there any problem with it?

134
00:06:45,721 --> 00:06:49,351
There is no movement of
our crucial Diamond Legion.

135
00:06:49,352 --> 00:06:50,976
Why are they dilly-dallying?

136
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:54,481
Commander Goriall,
why are we not attacking?

137
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:57,749
We can't hold down these
ruffians any longer!

138
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,152
I know.

139
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:03,197
Its a simple feat to suppress
these amateur filled rebel army.

140
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:05,200
But, wait for now.

141
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:05,716
Roger!

142
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:11,248
Goriall, as you already know,

143
00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:17,295
Diamond Legion is my proud elite unit
I forged over a span of 10 years.

144
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:19,297
It's my honor, Your Highness.

145
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:25,302
Therefore, you shall be victorious
without losing a single warrior.

146
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:27,070
Roger!...Huh?

147
00:07:27,402 --> 00:07:29,598
Without losing a single one?

148
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,494
It's just a mutiny
in a remote region.

149
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:36,564
I can't lose anyone
from my precious army for that.

150
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:41,319
Complete annihilation
without losing one of ours.

151
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,572
What exactly should I do now...

152
00:07:43,573 --> 00:07:46,365
And that's a sad mid-level
executive right there.

153
00:07:47,074 --> 00:07:50,512
Don't tell me, is this also one of the
strategy of the "Wisdom of the Empire"?

154
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,037
What will you do?

155
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,542
Send this to our home country.

156
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:56,976
I'll take a look.

157
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:00,045
This is...

158
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:03,692
A false information which
will drag this country into war!

159
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,386
Are you really sure
about sending this?

160
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:09,906
It's an appropriate concern
for a Black Crow like you.

161
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,391
Don't stand out too much,

162
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:14,143
try collecting the information
while staying in the shadows.

163
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,169
But I am a White Crow.

164
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,684
For the glory of
homeland Sunkland,

165
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:25,363
it was my long-cherished desire
to use information as a weapon.

166
00:08:25,364 --> 00:08:27,716
According to someone,
among Wind Crows,

167
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,732
there was a group of special
forces called White Crows,

168
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,177
to where Graham belonged.

169
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,997
I hope that you are aware?

170
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:38,036
That you must be prioritizing our White
Crows' mission than anything else.

171
00:08:38,037 --> 00:08:38,911
Yes, I am.

172
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:45,300
The Sunkland King,
who honors the justice and the fairness,

173
00:08:45,301 --> 00:08:49,970
it was such a prideful thing for me
to work for such a person, but...

174
00:08:53,641 --> 00:08:57,312
Watch where you're walking,
you nuisance.

175
00:08:57,313 --> 00:08:58,896
My apologies...

176
00:09:00,648 --> 00:09:04,318
Do you think you can get away just
by apologizing, you lowly maid?

177
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:08,800
Things likes this are pretty
common in this country

178
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,240
In that case, I'd sooner..

179
00:09:11,325 --> 00:09:12,534
Pick that up!

180
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:19,934
Ah, Your Highness, Abel!

181
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:23,213
No, it's just, that woman was...

182
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:25,465
I told you to pick that up!

183
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:26,398
Yes Sir!!

184
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:33,723
If this kind of discourtesy
happened again with the maids,

185
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:35,016
I won't be going easy on you.

186
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:37,493
Yes Sir!
Now if you'll excuse me...

187
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:40,021
I am so sorry, Your Highness.

188
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:42,189
No, I should be apologizing too

189
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:45,542
It must be tough working
in such an environment.

190
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:50,839
I know it may be impolite
for me to say this, but...

191
00:09:52,032 --> 00:09:53,676
You have changed.

192
00:09:54,146 --> 00:09:55,303
Is that so?

193
00:09:55,536 --> 00:09:58,138
Yes.
You have become more manly now.

194
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:02,101
Because I can't show her
my miserable sides.

195
00:10:02,471 --> 00:10:03,405
Her?

196
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:08,298
Wisdom of the Empire, the girl who
changed Prince Abel to a young brave man.

197
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:11,924
What kind of person is her?

198
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:16,557
Someone who's so attractive,
I feel like I can't reach her,

199
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:22,538
but she is someone who believed
and encouraged me to move forward.

200
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:26,959
And that is why I must
live up to her trust.

201
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,902
I have to work hard...

202
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:30,738
Or so I thought...

203
00:10:30,946 --> 00:10:33,950
By any means,
will you be going to the battlefronts?

204
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:36,201
Yeah,
because we are in a stalemate.

205
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:40,164
To encourage our soldiers
I need to be out there.

206
00:10:40,789 --> 00:10:44,001
As a royalty,
I must fulfill my responsibilities.

207
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:46,129
Is there something
you are worried about?

208
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,007
Ah, no...
there is nothing... just...

209
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:53,510
Supporting the
oppression of my people,

210
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:56,100
I don't think she'll
forgive me for that.

211
00:11:05,314 --> 00:11:06,899
To the motherland, okay?

212
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:23,832
I wrote the truth here, but there's no
guarantee that it will reach that person.

213
00:11:26,668 --> 00:11:27,586
But...

214
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:30,214
Somehow... Please make it..

215
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:37,386
Well... What should we do now?

216
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:40,141
For now I'd like to
rendezvous with Keithwood.

217
00:11:40,142 --> 00:11:41,225
Rendezvous?

218
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:44,687
We already decided on where to
meet before we got separated.

219
00:11:44,688 --> 00:11:46,981
It's about a half-day
horse carriage trip from here.

220
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:49,561
But there are none here...

221
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:54,113
The merchant earlier said that the
carriages are dispatched regularly, but...

222
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,715
Ah, that's it!

223
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,399
However...

224
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:03,123
Oh my Sion, do you, by chance,
not have money?

225
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:06,084
I left all my money
with Keithwood.

226
00:12:06,085 --> 00:12:08,962
I guess it can't be helped then.

227
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,272
What are you doing!

228
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,799
It's a provision for such times.

229
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:16,926
Why in such a place...

230
00:12:16,927 --> 00:12:20,431
That's obvious,
so that it won't get stolen!

231
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:26,148
In the previous timeline,
Mia had a bitter memory of it.

232
00:12:27,054 --> 00:12:30,166
I don't have anything more..
I swear!

233
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,734
You liar! Just try to jump!!

234
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:39,741
I heard something!
You still have something with you, huh?!

235
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:43,496
I won't walk the same
path as that time!

236
00:12:43,497 --> 00:12:51,086
I've gathered the currency of neighboring
kingdoms so I can escape smoothly anytime!

237
00:12:51,378 --> 00:12:53,922
Can we ride a
carriage with this?

238
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:56,049
You're well prepared...

239
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,093
We might be able to,
with this much...

240
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,225
What's the usual price for riding
a set route carriage again?

241
00:13:04,226 --> 00:13:07,270
As expected,
they're both sheltered kids.

242
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:10,398
Can I leave the
negotiations to you?

243
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,025
I guess so...

244
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:17,487
Having a lady pay while I don't do
anything feels pretty lame after all...

245
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:21,825
Make sure not to get
scammed, okay!

246
00:13:22,284 --> 00:13:23,410
I know that!

247
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:28,582
Even for a perfect superhuman like him,
there's something he's not good with.

248
00:13:33,462 --> 00:13:34,505
Mia!!

249
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:48,228
Where is this?

250
00:13:48,229 --> 00:13:49,896
She's awake?

251
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,814
Don't tell me, it's those guys?

252
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:57,528
They seem different though...

253
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:02,242
It's a bit sudden but, little girl,
do you have some money with you?

254
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:06,079
Either gold or silver
coin, or maybe accessory?

255
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,289
I don't have anything like that!

256
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,874
Really?

257
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,793
Fine then,
give us a little hop then.

258
00:14:14,252 --> 00:14:15,755
Alright!

259
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:21,469
I won't fall for that!
I have more experience, you know?

260
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,680
Isn't it inside her socks?

261
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:25,681
That's where kids usually
hide stuff after all.

262
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,271
Damn, it's a miss!

263
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,190
Told you I got nothing!

264
00:14:34,191 --> 00:14:35,358
Don't get carried away!

265
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:37,443
We can just sell you
to a slave trader...

266
00:14:37,444 --> 00:14:38,114
Ouch!

267
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:44,158
Did you have fun bullying
such a small girl?

268
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,411
Lynsha! No, it's...

269
00:14:46,412 --> 00:14:49,872
We just thought if we threat her a bit,
she'll cough out some money...

270
00:14:49,873 --> 00:14:53,126
Jem is the one who ordered
you to kidnap her, right?

271
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:55,087
Then make the
preparations already!

272
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:56,878
Preparations?

273
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,841
Are you going to
carry her all the way?

274
00:14:59,842 --> 00:15:02,978
There should be a carriage that
the rebel faction can use freely.

275
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:04,861
Rebel faction?

276
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:08,099
Also, check on the preparation
to carry out our plan!

277
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,059
Plan?!

278
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,810
Fine...

279
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,773
Now, you...

280
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,400
Who are you?

281
00:15:19,526 --> 00:15:22,780
I might be involved in
something very dangerous...

282
00:15:22,781 --> 00:15:25,575
That guy said he's going to
sell me to slave traders too...

283
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:26,868
You don't want to talk?

284
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:28,745
Well, I don't really mind...

285
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:33,665
Help me!!

286
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:41,215
Hey, can you stop this rebellion?

287
00:15:42,215 --> 00:15:46,762
If you can stop it, then please.
Save my brother.

288
00:15:47,054 --> 00:15:48,722
Stop the rebellion?

289
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,767
You also said to save
your brother, but...

290
00:15:50,768 --> 00:15:52,517
What do you mean by that?

291
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:53,728
We don't have time.

292
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:55,019
We'll talk while we walk out.

293
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,937
Wear your shoes.

294
00:15:59,274 --> 00:16:00,152
Where are we?

295
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:02,420
It's one of the underground
rebel faction's base.

296
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:06,364
The safety is pretty bad around
here, so stay close to me.

297
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,051
What you meant by rebel faction,

298
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,704
is the one that is currently
causing unrest here, right?

299
00:16:11,705 --> 00:16:12,538
Yeah.

300
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:16,167
My brother is the one who
leads the rebel faction.

301
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,563
So your brother is the leader
of the whole rebel group?!

302
00:16:20,754 --> 00:16:24,300
They call themselves rebel faction,
but it's just a group of grumps.

303
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:27,886
But then,
Jem roused everyone up...

304
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:33,242
Why are you telling me the
details about your rebel group?

305
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,436
Jem mentioned it to us.

306
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:38,998
That you pose danger to the group,
so we have to catch you..

307
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,107
Jem?

308
00:16:40,857 --> 00:16:42,485
If we deduce it from that,

309
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:46,756
then that means you have the power to
stop and scatter the rebel group, right?

310
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:53,538
Are you saying that a kid like
me can do something about it?

311
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:54,497
Well, yeah?

312
00:16:54,498 --> 00:16:58,126
When you were captured by the guys,
it looks like you're taking it easy.

313
00:16:58,127 --> 00:17:00,503
Even now,
you're actually pretty calm, right?

314
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:02,796
I don't think you're
just a simple kid.

315
00:17:04,015 --> 00:17:05,233
Lynsha, you wench!

316
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:07,759
You're trying to take all the
achievements for yourself, huh?!

317
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:10,262
Is the preparation done already?

318
00:17:10,564 --> 00:17:12,365
No, about that...

319
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,098
Thank you for guiding me.

320
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,393
Sorry, it took me some time
to look for you.

321
00:17:16,601 --> 00:17:17,853
Sion!

322
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:19,897
Are you hurt anywhere, Mia?

323
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:21,315
No...

324
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:24,109
By the way,
who's that lady with you?

325
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,508
I... I'm...

326
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:27,196
This person is Lynsha.

327
00:17:27,197 --> 00:17:31,325
She's a member of the underground
rebel group, but she saved me.

328
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:34,287
I also managed to get
some info from her.

329
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:39,208
You managed to turn from hostage into
friends with the rebel in a short time?

330
00:17:39,209 --> 00:17:43,229
So she's getting kidnapped in
purpose to get more information?!

331
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,297
Totally not.

332
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:46,966
I can think of you as an ally, right?

333
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:49,384
As long as you can
stop the rebellion...

334
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:51,596
Stopping the rebellion, huh...

335
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:54,891
We have to do something about the
hefty tax that Remno Kingdom takes...

336
00:17:54,892 --> 00:17:59,394
No, my brother isn't
fighting to lower the tax.

337
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,041
It's to free Dasayev Donovan who
was captured by the royal family.

338
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,028
What do you mean by that?

339
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:10,990
It seems like the king has imprisoned
the prime minister, Donovan,

340
00:18:10,991 --> 00:18:12,949
somewhere to silence him.

341
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:18,080
They don't know what would happen if they
harm those who represent the people...

342
00:18:18,081 --> 00:18:19,414
How stupid...

343
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:25,071
Outland Count Rudolvon is a great
man who shared food with the people,

344
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:27,673
the people who royals like you
and high nobles had abandoned.

345
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:33,053
Do you even understand what would
happen by killing someone like him?

346
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:37,723
You guys couldn't even think
about such a simple thing?

347
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,231
At that moment, I wanted to say to Sion
who's having such triumphant expression...

348
00:18:43,232 --> 00:18:46,107
That there's no way such an
outrageous thing could've happened.

349
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:51,488
There's no way my father would execute
his retainer to take their popularity.

350
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:53,824
That story...

351
00:18:53,825 --> 00:18:55,800
It seems a bit weird to me...

352
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,162
Emergency!

353
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,553
What is this?
What's with the crowd?

354
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,092
Actually, our allies went into arms, and
are heading towards the mayor's mansion.

355
00:19:11,093 --> 00:19:14,178
What?! The plan was supposed to
be carried out in 2 days, right?

356
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:16,305
Is this Jem's order too?

357
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:18,808
No, it's your brother's
personal decision.

358
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,386
It's for the sake of our allies
who are fighting the army, he said.

359
00:19:22,387 --> 00:19:24,156
Geez!

360
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,650
Let's go to the
mayor's house then!

361
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:31,001
Ha! What' wrong with this girl?

362
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:34,946
There's no way I'm going to
such a dangerous place like that...

363
00:19:34,947 --> 00:19:38,202
My goodness,
that's pretty dangerous, you know.

364
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:40,246
Right?

365
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:43,030
But, if you really want to,
then we can accompany you!

366
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:44,041
No, no, no!

367
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:47,336
Nobody said we're going!

368
00:19:47,337 --> 00:19:49,839
I want to rendezvous
with Keithwood group,

369
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,027
but I can't let the chance
that Mia created go to waste!

370
00:19:52,028 --> 00:19:53,968
No, that's not how it is!

371
00:19:53,969 --> 00:19:56,155
Let's hurry up and go!

372
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,435
By the way, who's this Jem guy?

373
00:20:02,436 --> 00:20:04,061
A collaborator of the rebel army.

374
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:06,355
My brother said he
met Jem in a bar.

375
00:20:06,356 --> 00:20:08,858
So that's the guy who
ordered to kidnap Mia?

376
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,694
Yeah, because she might be
a hindrance to our revolt.

377
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:14,371
So he's an ally of those who
attacked the carriage, huh...

378
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:23,623
Seems like the river where we fell to
yesterday is running nearby, isn't it?

379
00:20:23,624 --> 00:20:27,042
Yeah, that means it's a strategic
point for transportation...

380
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,647
The one who picked this city as a
place for the uprising, is it also Jem?

381
00:20:33,256 --> 00:20:37,260
If that's so, it feels like he had
picked the perfect place to attack.

382
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,057
What's with those blue bandana?

383
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:43,559
It's like a symbol
for the rebel faction.

384
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,187
I think they call it the
"Blue turban party".

385
00:20:46,188 --> 00:20:47,729
"Blue turban party"?

386
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:50,523
What a perfect timing.
Let's sneak among them.

387
00:20:52,192 --> 00:20:54,944
We're just demanding
something that's very obvious!

388
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,949
We want to let our agonizing voice
over the heavy tax to be heard!

389
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,537
And we'd like our advocate, Prime
minister Dasayev, to be returned to us!

390
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,123
But, the royal government
won't listen to our plea.

391
00:21:07,638 --> 00:21:11,060
Even the mayor irresponsibly
escaped from his manor!

392
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,743
It's a pity we couldn't stop him,

393
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,524
but we managed to take over the
city without much struggle.

394
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:19,345
Everything is thanks
to our comrades.

395
00:21:19,346 --> 00:21:21,086
Everyone, thank you.

396
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:24,723
An agitator, huh....

397
00:21:24,724 --> 00:21:27,268
The way he stirs up the
people is great, but...

398
00:21:28,937 --> 00:21:31,064
Ah, Lynsha, you're here.

399
00:21:32,755 --> 00:21:34,131
Brother Lambert...

400
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,779
Oh? Who are those kids?

401
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:40,532
Could it be the kids that
Jem was talking about?

402
00:21:40,824 --> 00:21:43,886
Those who might become hindrance
to the revolution, or something...

403
00:21:48,756 --> 00:21:49,882
Stop it!

404
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:55,423
If we point our blades to prepubescent
kids, no one will want to listen to us!

405
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:56,799
Please, brother!

406
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,758
Please talk to those kids!

407
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:01,928
Talk, huh...

408
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:14,816
<i>To remember what went down today</i>

409
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:19,989
<i>I'll journal every single word</i>

410
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,284
<i>Whether it's good or bad</i>

411
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:28,247
<i>It's my only life,
gotta seize the day</i>

412
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:32,460
<i>You never realize the
importance of something</i>

413
00:22:32,461 --> 00:22:36,088
<i>Until it's out of sight</i>

414
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:49,100
<i>Every beginning is
for a perfect ending</i>

415
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:55,107
<i>Dear Moon, I won't just pray</i>

416
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:59,612
<i>Let me stand on my own
feet, just one more time</i>

417
00:22:59,613 --> 00:23:05,201
<i>Sweet Moon,
not just a shiny stone</i>

418
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:09,497
<i>I'll find sweet joy</i>

419
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:16,504
<i>And a future that is
sky blue and clear</i>

420
00:23:16,505 --> 00:23:23,010
<i>Queen of the Night</i>

421
00:23:23,011 --> 00:23:33,686
<i>I am the Queen of the Night</i>
