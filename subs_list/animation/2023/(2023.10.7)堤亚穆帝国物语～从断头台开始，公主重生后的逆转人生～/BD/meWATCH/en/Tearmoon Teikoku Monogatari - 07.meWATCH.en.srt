1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,365
Coming into a long holiday...

2
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:12,436
Mia is on her way back home,
to get away from school life for a bit.

3
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:18,085
Due to the head chef kindness,
my last supper will be a grand one!

4
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,671
It said it's Yellow Moon tomato stew!

5
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,029
No, no, no!

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:28,010
In the end it's still
the guillotine end!

7
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:32,724
As I thought, the main trigger is the
food shortage due to crop failure...

8
00:00:32,725 --> 00:00:35,477
Also,
this one is worrying too...

9
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:40,107
A skirmish in the bordering
woods with some small tribes...

10
00:00:41,482 --> 00:00:43,651
I'm feeling sick...

11
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:46,905
Anne... Anne...

12
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:48,417
What's wrong?

13
00:00:48,418 --> 00:00:50,367
I want to puke...

14
00:00:50,368 --> 00:00:51,994
Is it motion sickness?!

15
00:00:53,674 --> 00:00:57,790
No!! Princess Mia!!

00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:09,609
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

20
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:11,694
<i>I am!</i>

21
00:01:16,532 --> 00:01:17,826
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going
through as a helpless princess</i>

22
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,202
<i>If that's what you
thought, then go ahead!?</i>

<i>That is not good,

29
00:01:34,343 --> 00:01:35,719

(Episode 7: Princess Mia, Being Skillful)

48
00:02:33,636 --> 00:02:36,390
Long time no see, Princess Mia.

49
00:02:36,391 --> 00:02:40,017
I'm glad you're in good health
too, Ludwig.

50
00:02:42,603 --> 00:02:45,607
Our food reserve plan
isn't there yet, huh...

51
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:49,319
If we increase it, even the storage
cost will give pressure to our finance.

52
00:02:50,315 --> 00:02:54,699
I'm so vexed that we can't explain
the famine that'll come in the future!

53
00:02:55,032 --> 00:02:59,162
Well then, if somehow a famine
occurs, what should we do?

54
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:03,332
Normally,
we'll have to import from traders.

55
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:06,877
But I'm sure they'll hit
us with exorbitant prices.

56
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:11,425
It's not like food suddenly disappears
from the world in one night,

57
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:13,634
there are places
that has food too...

58
00:03:13,843 --> 00:03:15,303
That means...

59
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,264
I got it!

60
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:19,349
A "friend rate"!

61
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:21,767
Friend... Rate?

62
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,273
It's a pleasure to meet you, Princess.

63
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:30,234
I'm Chloe's father,
Marco Forkroad.

64
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:33,946
Welcome, Sir Forkroad.

65
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:36,033
I was concerned about
my daughter's future,

66
00:03:36,035 --> 00:03:38,452
and enrolled her into Saint
Noelle Academy, but...

67
00:03:38,453 --> 00:03:43,206
To think that she became friends
with the Empire's princess!

68
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:45,333
But in the first place,
what's a "book buddy"?!

69
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,544
How's Chloe?

70
00:03:47,545 --> 00:03:50,547
A bookworm, as always.

71
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:53,967
In any case, this is a one in a lifetime
chance that my daughter graced me with!

72
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,386
Now, regarding what
I'd like to ask...

73
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:57,429
Yes?

74
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,725
Can you transport goods
from across the sea?

75
00:04:01,726 --> 00:04:04,061
Of course!

76
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:06,855
What is it that
you want to import?

77
00:04:06,856 --> 00:04:10,359
Spices? Or maybe, some rugs?

78
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,505
It's wheat!

79
00:04:13,527 --> 00:04:15,822
Why would you bring
that from overseas?!

80
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,033
I have some requirements though.

81
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:22,829
Even if a famine happens,
I won't let you raise its price.

82
00:04:23,953 --> 00:04:27,684
How ridiculous!
What's in it for me?!

83
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:35,133
But, according to Chloe, Princess Mia
isn't someone who would abuse her power...

84
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:40,638
I'm sure you'll give some leeway
for your daughter's friend, right?

85
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:44,059
Could it be... She's testing me?

86
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,977
Ah, right.

87
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:50,106
We will set a minimum amount of
wheat that we will always buy.

88
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:53,610
I forgot it!

89
00:04:53,611 --> 00:04:56,737
Ludwig told me to mention that.

90
00:04:56,987 --> 00:05:02,035
No matter what happens, they'll
buy a set amount in a set price...

91
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,596
So that means it won't change
with market price, huh...

92
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:10,877
Since we'll be taking goods from overseas,
the set price will be pretty high too.

93
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:13,713
Do you have any
suggestions for that?

94
00:05:15,172 --> 00:05:18,217
Here is the contract,
and the details.

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,807
It's much cheaper compared to
the time when there's famine...

96
00:05:23,808 --> 00:05:29,521
I left the pricing to Ludwig...
I hope it's good enough...

97
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:33,191
That's... a great price.

98
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:35,025
I can make enough profit.

99
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:38,780
I see, in exchange of paying
extra in normal times,

100
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:41,158
We'll have to finance them
when there's famine...

101
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:44,494
Other than building a foundation so that
her people won't fall to starvation,

102
00:05:44,495 --> 00:05:47,747
she still brings deal
partner, me, a profit too...

103
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,292
What a scary person...

104
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:53,962
"Friend rate", in other words,
giving illegal profit to a friend...

105
00:05:53,963 --> 00:05:58,467
She took on that dirty role, and giving
me an example that we can do that much.

106
00:05:58,468 --> 00:06:03,305
She's telling me to loosen my
iron grip from the nobles...

107
00:06:03,306 --> 00:06:04,333
So this is...

108
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:06,474
The Wisdom of The Empire!

109
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:10,103
Due to their own misunderstandings,

110
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:13,272
everything was closed
without any problems.

111
00:06:15,024 --> 00:06:21,698
Next day, Mia went to see the slums that
she visited before, the New Moon district.

112
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:25,327
The atmosphere here has
changed quite a bit, hasn't it?

113
00:06:25,328 --> 00:06:27,662
Since the hospital
began operating,

114
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:32,292
we also increased the food
distribution, and life slowly recovered.

115
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:34,127
That's great!

116
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:36,880
Princess!

117
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:40,007
Ah, you're from that time...

118
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:44,429
Seems like you're
totally fine now!

119
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,807
Yeah!
Thanks to Princess, thank you!

120
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,143
I'll give you this! As a thanks!

121
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:52,770
What's this?

122
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:54,981
It's a unicorn hairpin!

123
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:57,526
Wow, a unicorn?

124
00:06:57,527 --> 00:06:59,903
It's made from a tree
from my hometown.

125
00:06:59,904 --> 00:07:02,095
This is really good.

126
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:07,326
Thank you, this is wonderful!

127
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,996
Alright then!

128
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:14,416
That's a memento from her mom.

129
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:20,590
So, what did you mean
by it's a memento?

130
00:07:20,591 --> 00:07:23,593
His mother came from
Sealence Forest,

131
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:27,429
the home of a small tribe in
the borders of the Empire...

132
00:07:27,888 --> 00:07:32,936
But, she had a eloped with someone
outside the tribe, and came here...

133
00:07:32,937 --> 00:07:36,730
And then, she died of sickness
when that kid is still very young.

134
00:07:37,273 --> 00:07:41,278
Could it be,
that small tribe is called Lulu tribe?

135
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,988
As expected from the
Princess, you know them.

136
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,160
If it's Lulu tribe, then that's where
Tiona's servant, Liora, came from...

137
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:54,082
According to the diary, the Empire is
having a territorial dispute with them...

138
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:58,154
This will end up making Tiona
get a bad impression of me!

139
00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:01,380
It's better if I don't
get caught up in this!

140
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:05,885
It's such an important item,
I don't think I should receive it...

141
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,221
No, please take it.

142
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:14,144
Ever since you saved him, he always said
that he wants to show his gratitude.

143
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:17,813
That hairpin is a gift that
comes straight from his heart.

144
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:20,275
If that's so...

145
00:08:20,276 --> 00:08:24,529
I'll do the opposite,
and create a good relation with that kid!

146
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,431
I'll wear it
everyday from now on!

147
00:08:28,782 --> 00:08:34,455
Mia still hasn't realized that this
action will bring a huge effect.

148
00:08:35,205 --> 00:08:37,948
Around the same time,
Empire's south east area,

149
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:41,186
Berman Viscountcy,
in Berman residence...

150
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,298
Outland Count Rudolvon...

151
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,426
That damn annoying
backwater noble!

152
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:52,973
The trigger happened in a certain
party, from such a meaningless talk.

153
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,476
But really, Viscount Berman.

154
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,731
You came from a long running,
strong central nobles,

155
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:02,108
but why is Outland Count
Rudolvon,

156
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:05,612
who's new and came from the boonies,
has a bigger territory than you.

157
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:08,113
I can't understand it at all.

158
00:09:08,572 --> 00:09:12,076
His territory is mostly for
agriculture and forestry.

159
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,330
There's nothing to be
proud just from the size.

160
00:09:15,331 --> 00:09:17,496
But even so...

161
00:09:17,973 --> 00:09:22,395
Losing to that ground-smelling
noble even in one thing,

162
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,463
is quite questionable,
in my opinion...

163
00:09:26,131 --> 00:09:28,258
I have an idea.

164
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:32,138
You should open up
the Sealence forest.

165
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,365
Sealence forest?

166
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:38,561
Between Viscount Berman and
Count Rudolvon territory,

167
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:42,899
there's a huge area of forest
called Sealence forest,

168
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:45,985
and it turned the borders
between both area a bit vague.

169
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:51,074
So, Berman thought of taking over the
forest and expand their territory.

170
00:09:51,075 --> 00:09:53,683
But there's a problem.

171
00:09:53,685 --> 00:09:58,331
The Lulu tribe who's living in the forest
is showing a tough resistance.

172
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:00,016
Berman, who's in a panic,

173
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:04,462
bribed the Empire's army
to dispatch a centuria.

174
00:10:04,463 --> 00:10:08,466
But, the centurion
doesn't want to enter the forest,

175
00:10:08,468 --> 00:10:10,610
under the pretext of
protecting the peace,

176
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:13,972
Making Berman's frustration
reach its peak...

177
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:15,265
Damn you...

178
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:19,768
If that's so, I'll just convince
those on the higher ranks...

179
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:27,484
Mia, from what I see,
your hair became smoother lately!

180
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:30,989
Of course!

181
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:34,576
It's a shampoo that
Prince Abel sent me...

182
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:40,206
It's not just cleaning your hair, but also
enrich your hair and bring out the luster!

183
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,224
It's a highly praised item,
so I'm sure you'll like it...

184
00:10:45,252 --> 00:10:48,422
I hope it made Princess Mia's
favorite horse glowing too...

185
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:55,221
As expected from Prince Abel,
what a wonderful present...

186
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,806
It was a shampoo for horse.

187
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,643
Nice to meet you,
Viscount Berman.

188
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:05,857
How beautiful!

189
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:08,817
Not just your looks,
but also that hair!

190
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:13,006
It's like the hair of a famous horse
that charges through battlefields!

191
00:11:13,007 --> 00:11:15,992
You're good with words!

192
00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:18,635
It's not entirely wrong.

193
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:22,414
In the end, she's just a spoiled brat...

194
00:11:22,664 --> 00:11:25,668
Oh look,
isn't that a unicorn hairpin?

195
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,337
It suits you well.

196
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:30,298
I've been wearing it almost
everyday, lately!

197
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:31,591
The truth is...

198
00:11:31,592 --> 00:11:35,261
That hairpin was made from a
wood from a certain forest...

199
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:38,181
It's Sealence forest, right?

200
00:11:38,182 --> 00:11:39,890
So you know!

201
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:42,655
What do you think?

202
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:47,947
If we reclaim the forest under your order,
we can make those as much as you want.

203
00:11:47,948 --> 00:11:51,361
I'd like to go to that forest!

204
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:55,615
Ludwig,
let's go there right now.

205
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:56,949
Make the preparations.

206
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:01,537
Right now?! No way...

207
00:12:09,503 --> 00:12:13,675
Thanks to Viscount Berman,
I have a pretext to go to the forest.

208
00:12:13,676 --> 00:12:17,178
I better make friends with the
Lulu tribe in this opportunity.

209
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:20,473
Mia still prioritizes
herself as usual.

210
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:24,269
But really, to think that we can
move right after I ordered you.

211
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,810
That was amazing.

212
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:30,441
This squad is your personal
escort, the "Princess Guard".

213
00:12:30,442 --> 00:12:32,152
I organized them for you.

214
00:12:32,153 --> 00:12:34,695
Whoa, that sounds great!

215
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:36,614
And so, Ludwig...

216
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:37,323
Yes?

217
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:41,493
Can you tell me a bit about
Count Berman and his territory?

218
00:12:45,372 --> 00:12:48,084
As a brilliant official,

219
00:12:48,085 --> 00:12:52,880
Ludwig told all the problems that
happened in Berman's Viscountcy.

220
00:12:54,464 --> 00:12:56,217
That's friggin' close!!

221
00:12:56,218 --> 00:12:59,368
She almost let out
an unladylike words.

222
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:03,933
But in reality, Mia is actually standing
on the branching point of her fate.

223
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:07,729
Reclaiming Sealence forest
for their resource...

224
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,456
And to do that,
we chase away Lulu tribe...

225
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:14,110
And the one lies after that,
is Count Rudolvon's territory...

226
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:17,572
There's too many red flag words!

227
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:22,785
According to the diary,
my relationship with Tiona will worsen...

228
00:13:24,494 --> 00:13:25,621
Princess Mia?

229
00:13:26,204 --> 00:13:28,833
I've understand all
the mysteries now..

230
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:32,335
I won't forgive Viscount Berman!

231
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:36,590
As I thought, she's someone who
won't forgive the noble's tyranny...

232
00:13:36,924 --> 00:13:39,676
But,
what are you planning to do?

233
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:44,139
Well of course!
We'll crush them!

234
00:13:53,315 --> 00:13:57,627
Is it another warning letter
from Viscount Berman, Captain?

235
00:13:59,196 --> 00:14:00,740
For crying out loud...

236
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:04,427
Those nobles, they really can just tell
people kill each other with no hesitation.

237
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,870
How carefree.

238
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:07,621
I can understand.

239
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:11,542
Even though we already said that
our goal is to maintain the peace.

240
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:15,295
Yeah, there's no way I'm sending my
precious subordinate to die a dog's death.

241
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:17,840
Fighting inside these
forest is too dangerous.

242
00:14:17,841 --> 00:14:21,219
Probably the only ones who can go
back alive is either you or me.

243
00:14:22,178 --> 00:14:24,591
Only the captain and
vice-captain survives.

244
00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:26,265
That doesn't sound good too.

245
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,646
Royal guards, huh...

246
00:14:31,647 --> 00:14:35,065
According to the gossips,
the Princess will come here to check...

247
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:36,943
That's pretty useless...

248
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:40,655
Do you feel like
something's fishy too, captain?

249
00:14:40,656 --> 00:14:44,742
We should consider that the
Viscount brought her here.

250
00:14:44,743 --> 00:14:48,121
Now now, let's see what
kind of things she'll say...

251
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:53,209
But, you know, I heard our Princess
has quite a good head on her shoulders.

252
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,213
There's nothing good coming from listening
to what people wants, not reality.

253
00:14:57,214 --> 00:14:59,382
That's quite the
pessimistic outlook...

254
00:14:59,383 --> 00:15:01,800
Which philosopher said that?

255
00:15:02,467 --> 00:15:03,635
It's just me...

256
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,003
Princess Mia!

257
00:15:22,003 --> 00:15:24,006
Are you okay?! Princess Mia!

258
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,033
Princess Mia!

259
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:34,958
The battle with Lulu tribe in Sealence
forest was caused by your selfishness...

260
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,587
In that battle,
I lost all my subordinates!

261
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:41,339
I'll never forgive you!

262
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:49,057
Princess Mia! How are you feeling?

263
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:53,186
It's just... The heat got me bad...

264
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:54,631
I'm okay now.

265
00:15:54,632 --> 00:15:56,355
Nice to meet you.

266
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:58,106
I'm Dion Alaia.

267
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,944
I'm the leader of the Empire
soldier that was dispatched here.

268
00:16:01,945 --> 00:16:04,238
It's not nice
meeting you at all...

269
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:07,825
How dare you chopped
my head like that...

270
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:09,619
Is there something on my face?

271
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,621
Nothing!

272
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:15,208
The person over there looks
like a bear, so I was just scared!

273
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,919
A bear, you said?

274
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,547
Princess Mia, please go with
Captain Dion and check the forest.

275
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,673
What?

276
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,134
I'll have the royal guards
go with you too.

277
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,808
What the heck is this
four-eyes saying...

278
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:35,394
Please don't decide things
on your own, Sir Ludwig.

279
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,038
Yeah, that's right.

280
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,772
Be more angry!

281
00:16:39,147 --> 00:16:41,192
The imperial guard's
armor is too gaudy.

282
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:44,195
If the Lulu tribe got
aggravated and it incited a war,

283
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:45,779
will you take the
responsibility?

284
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:48,490
I see, I understand the risks...

285
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,993
But, even knowing the risk,

286
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:53,638
letting Princess Mia
check the forest quietly,

287
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,249
would be the best way to
understand the situation.

288
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,128
It shows just how much he's
devoted to the princess, huh...

289
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:03,755
You two, what is this about...?

290
00:17:05,298 --> 00:17:08,026
Well, if that's so,
then it can't be helped...

291
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,515
That's how it is.
That's okay, right, Princess Mia?

292
00:17:12,516 --> 00:17:16,017
Not okay at all!

293
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,398
Are you okay, Miss Mia?

294
00:17:20,399 --> 00:17:21,915
Err, yeah?

295
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:29,115
In the first place, why would we
need to station soldiers here?

296
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:34,370
No reason, on the contrary, it just
increase the risk of a war happening.

297
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:35,496
If that's so...

298
00:17:35,497 --> 00:17:39,500
But sadly,
we only follow orders.

299
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:43,411
Even if we know it's better to pull
out, without a reason, we can't.

300
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,465
A reason to pull
out the soldiers...

301
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,347
Excuse me, what's this place?

302
00:17:53,348 --> 00:17:56,225
This is insider the
forest, the battlefront.

303
00:17:56,226 --> 00:17:58,269
Battlefront?!

304
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,397
Please don't touch anything
inside the forest recklessly.

305
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:05,233
To them, the trees in this
forest is a valuable asset...

306
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,375
If you treat it carelessly...

307
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,672
Geez, I've had enough!

308
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,402
Let's go back to the city...

309
00:18:14,546 --> 00:18:17,388
Princess! Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

310
00:18:17,389 --> 00:18:19,582
Please be careful, Princess...

311
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,835
It's the root fault
for being on my way...

312
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,590
That's right,
it's this tree's fault!

313
00:18:27,591 --> 00:18:28,535
This tree here!

314
00:18:28,536 --> 00:18:29,382
Princess?

315
00:18:30,383 --> 00:18:32,135
What an annoying tree!

316
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:47,442
We're pulling back!
Retreat to the outside of the forest!

317
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:53,199
I'm sorry for my rudeness,
but I'll freaking kill you, Princess!

318
00:18:54,783 --> 00:18:56,118
I already told you, right?

319
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,303
Don't touch the forest recklessly!

320
00:18:58,662 --> 00:19:01,207
Just focus on escaping!

321
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,418
You don't have to tell me,
I'm heading straight to the station!

322
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:06,587
Back to the city!

323
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:10,216
I won't be able to calm down before you
put me into the Viscount's residence!

324
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:13,719
Then just go!
Go with your royal guards!

325
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,680
I'll send you with
a squad for escort!

326
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:16,681
No...

327
00:19:16,682 --> 00:19:18,306
Bring everyone!

328
00:19:26,606 --> 00:19:28,108
That was close..

329
00:19:29,276 --> 00:19:30,361
This is an order!

330
00:19:30,362 --> 00:19:34,447
All soldiers will escort me,
and go back to the city!

331
00:19:35,448 --> 00:19:39,078
It takes a lot of
preparation to move the army!

332
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,664
Are you saying that there's something
more important than protecting me?!

333
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,419
If it's an order,
then it can't be helped.

334
00:19:47,794 --> 00:19:49,337
Captain?!

335
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,089
Tell everyone!

336
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:54,010
We'll escort the
glorious princess,

337
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:57,679
and walk in a straight line,
back to the city!

338
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:03,643
Princess! What have you done?!

339
00:20:03,843 --> 00:20:06,108
If something happened
in the forest...

340
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:12,071
Oh, then, are you saying that a few men
should be enough to escort me, Viscount?

341
00:20:12,694 --> 00:20:15,489
No, that's not it, at all...

342
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,369
Also, I want to consult my father
regarding the forest,

343
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,749
so please refrain from cutting the trees,
or moving army into that forest.

344
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,124
No way!

345
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:30,086
Well then, that's how it is,
please do so!

346
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,092
Finally we secured a place
where our soldiers can rest.

347
00:20:35,093 --> 00:20:37,636
That was pretty tough...

348
00:20:38,553 --> 00:20:39,639
Excuse me!

349
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,264
Centurion Dion.

350
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,977
I'm really sorry for the trouble
that our Princess has caused you...

351
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:49,439
I think the Princess
actually helped us.

352
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,359
What do you mean by that...?

353
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:55,070
Don't you understand?
It was a bluff.

354
00:20:55,278 --> 00:20:56,236
Bluff?

355
00:20:56,237 --> 00:21:01,786
So the Princess kicked the tree to
make a reason for our army to retreat?

356
00:21:03,286 --> 00:21:05,597
Now you understand, right?

357
00:21:06,456 --> 00:21:11,243
It's up to you now if what
Princess Mia had done will be in vain.

358
00:21:12,003 --> 00:21:14,815
If the Emperor found out that
the Lulu tribe attacked us,

359
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,217
He won't stay still, right?

360
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:21,680
That's why, you mustn't talk about
what happened in that forest...

361
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:24,015
Yes! Of course!

362
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,146
Why do I have to defend
for Princess Mia...

363
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,068
I'm exhausted...

364
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:37,363
I want to just go
and rest for today..

365
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:41,534
Hm? Mia, where's your hairpin?

366
00:21:42,448 --> 00:21:44,929
Eh? You're right!

367
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,429
That's weird...

368
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:56,172
Why would I drop something that
comes from Lulu tribe in that forest!!

369
00:21:56,347 --> 00:21:57,466
Mia?

370
00:21:57,467 --> 00:22:02,363
Anything can become a
trigger for the rebellion!

371
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,306
I have to take it back, no matter what!

372
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:15,109
<i>To remember what went down today</i>

373
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:20,072
<i>I'll journal every single word</i>

374
00:22:20,073 --> 00:22:23,409
<i>Whether it's good or bad</i>

375
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:28,080
<i>It's my only life,
gotta seize the day</i>

376
00:22:28,081 --> 00:22:32,668
<i>You never realize the
importance of something</i>

377
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:36,130
<i>Until it's out of sight</i>

378
00:22:36,131 --> 00:22:49,184
<i>Every beginning is
for a perfect ending</i>

379
00:22:50,643 --> 00:22:55,191
<i>Dear Moon, I won't just pray</i>

380
00:22:55,192 --> 00:22:59,653
<i>Let me stand on my own
feet, just one more time</i>

381
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:05,117
<i>Sweet Moon,
not just a shiny stone</i>

382
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:09,580
<i>I'll find sweet joy</i>

383
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:16,312
<i>And a future that is
sky blue and clear</i>

384
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:23,052
<i>Queen of the Night</i>

385
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:33,895
<i>I am the Queen of the Night</i>
