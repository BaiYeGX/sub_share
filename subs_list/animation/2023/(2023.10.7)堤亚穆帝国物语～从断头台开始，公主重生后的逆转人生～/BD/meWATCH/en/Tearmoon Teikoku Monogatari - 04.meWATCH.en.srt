00:00:01,645 --> 00:00:06,197
My name is Mia Luna Tearmoon,
Imperial Princess of the Tearmoon Empire.

2
00:00:06,552 --> 00:00:10,968
I am the indecent woman who
approached your brother.

3
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:14,430
And that's why, Prince Sion...

4
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:22,088
It's such a pity but, regarding your
invite just now, I can't accept it.

5
00:00:23,589 --> 00:00:26,259
I see. It's a pity,
but it can't be helped.

6
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:30,513
Well then everyone,
if you'll excuse me...

7
00:00:33,933 --> 00:00:39,313
It was so satisfying to reject
Sion's invitation in public!

8
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:40,731
Princess Mia!

9
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:44,068
Thank you for
helping me just now.

10
00:00:44,364 --> 00:00:48,322
But, I'm not suitable for you.

11
00:00:48,557 --> 00:00:51,034
Please take Prince Sion
as your dance partner...

12
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:52,076
If that's so...

13
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,705
Improve yourself for my sake.

14
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:58,332
So that you'll be
suitable for me.

15
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:02,879
But, I don't even
have any talent...

16
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:05,464
No matter how hard I try,
Prince Sion will be better...

17
00:01:05,704 --> 00:01:08,009
No, I'll never even
beat my brother...

18
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:15,975
Prince Abel, don't you mean that
you can't beat them at the moment?

19
00:01:17,226 --> 00:01:21,981
Even if we're not suitable today,
or tomorrow, there's still the next day.

20
00:01:22,273 --> 00:01:27,153
No one knows where you'll end up just
by diligently training every day.

21
00:01:27,528 --> 00:01:33,634
There's no way you'll lose to Prince
Sion, and also your brother.

22
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:36,630
I've chosen you as my dance partner.

23
00:01:37,303 --> 00:01:40,666
So this Mia Luna Tearmoon,
will guarantee it!

24
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:43,085
Princess Mia!

25
00:01:44,318 --> 00:01:47,673
People who are blessed by
Gods definitely exists.

26
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:52,428
And for me who's not blessed,
giving an effort just sounds silly.

27
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:58,809
I've always thought that way,
yet, she still encourages me...

28
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,484
That's how Mia changed the
future of the second-rate prince.

29
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:06,902
But...

30
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:09,696
I'll have Prince Abel give his best...

31
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:12,407
After all, if his stupid
brother gets in our way,

32
00:02:12,408 --> 00:02:17,037
and they don't send reinforcement
when I need it, I'll be doomed!

33
00:02:17,038 --> 00:02:20,998
In the end,
Mia still puts her own needs first.

60
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,127

(Episode 4, Shall We Dance)

66
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,267
How wonderful, Prince Sion.

67
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,769
You're flattering me.

68
00:04:06,687 --> 00:04:07,938
Princess Mia...

69
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:09,940
Is she late...?

70
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,529
Why...

71
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,073
Why did it end up this way...

72
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:24,373
After preparing her dress and
make-up with fiery passion,

73
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:27,496
she took it easy and had a stroll
around the schoolgrounds.

74
00:04:27,498 --> 00:04:30,419
I even put my favorite
perfume, perfect!

75
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,130
And then...

76
00:04:33,714 --> 00:04:36,669
Wow! How adorable!

77
00:04:43,474 --> 00:04:48,896
The horse sneezed because
of Mia used too much perfume.

78
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:52,317
There's no helping it, Anne.

79
00:04:52,318 --> 00:04:55,779
Just use a little make-up
so that I won't bring shame...

80
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,116
For the dress,
just choose whichever from there...

81
00:04:59,117 --> 00:05:00,199
No!

82
00:05:01,324 --> 00:05:04,662
Mia, you shouldn't bring
shame to our country!

83
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:06,789
Just leave it to me!

84
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,969
Hey! Look at that!

85
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:24,932
Unbelievable...

86
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:29,687
That's Princess Mia
from Tearmoon Empire!

87
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:36,153
I knew it, coming to the party with such
a light dress will catch attention...

88
00:05:36,154 --> 00:05:37,111
No!

89
00:05:37,655 --> 00:05:42,491
The clothes wasn't tightened by corset,
and her skin is blushing from the bath.

90
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,204
Then, a white dress that
accentuate that jewel-like skin...

91
00:05:47,538 --> 00:05:51,542
And all that was illuminated by
a faint light from the venue...

92
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:54,129
She's like the Moon Goddess!

93
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,983
Mia captivated the all the boys
in the party in a blink of an eye.

94
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:01,594
How beautiful...

95
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:04,138
I'm going to dance with her...?

96
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:05,681
For real?

97
00:06:06,056 --> 00:06:07,683
I'm not dreaming, am I...?

98
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:10,144
Prince Abel...

99
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:13,105
My apologies...

100
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:18,027
I know it... She's going to
reject me as her partner...

101
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:20,988
No, I don't mind at all.

102
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:23,908
You're just too
beautiful after all...

103
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:27,995
Thank you very much, Prince Abel!

104
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:32,959
To think that he won't mention
anything about the dress...

105
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,127
Alright then, let's dance.

106
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,162
Mia has...

107
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:42,409
...one special skill...

108
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:46,224
...that won't lose to anyone.

109
00:06:46,597 --> 00:06:48,724
That is, ballroom dance.

110
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:55,607
What the heck, she took all the
attention, yet her dance is mediocre.

111
00:06:55,608 --> 00:06:58,668
Even if she's a princess of a huge
country, she's still a child after all.

112
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,261
It can't be helped, I guess.

113
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:03,213
No...

114
00:07:03,864 --> 00:07:08,869
Her exemplary steps
are carefully leading me...

115
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,665
Princess Mia is holding
back herself to my level...

116
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:18,088
That's good, Prince Abel.

117
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,464
You're doing great
with your steps.

118
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:27,304
She believed in me and now she's
being shamed because of me...

119
00:07:33,435 --> 00:07:39,275
Anne, you can use this money
as you will while I'm in the party.

120
00:07:41,318 --> 00:07:45,323
Listen, that amount of allowance is
not something that we can use freely!

121
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:47,200
Is that so?

122
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:50,161
But Mia told us to use it
according to our will, right?

123
00:07:50,162 --> 00:07:52,455
Then that means...

124
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:53,582
Yeah!

125
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:57,726
Mia is telling us to achieve
something with this money!

126
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:02,424
I, Anne, understood your wish
perfectly, Mia!

127
00:08:02,425 --> 00:08:04,843
I will definitely answer
to your expectations!

128
00:08:07,678 --> 00:08:10,432
You're... Miss Tiona's...

129
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:12,601
Please! Help us!

130
00:08:12,602 --> 00:08:15,436
Miss Tiona is being locked away!

131
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,656
Prince Abel?
Where are you going?

132
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:30,785
Prince Sion.

133
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:32,886
What's wrong?

134
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,957
Can you please dance with
the Princess for a bit?

135
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:38,959
What the heck is he saying?!

136
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:45,357
Well, I was about to ask her
for a dance too, actually.

137
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:47,384
May I dance with you for one song?

138
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,405
I'll get some drinks.

139
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:51,597
Why?!

140
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:55,101
I see...

141
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,144
Alright, just one song...

142
00:08:59,007 --> 00:09:01,007
I don't have the power to do it now...

143
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:05,444
So no matter how hard I try,
I won't be able to beat him.

144
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:06,654
But...

145
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,657
I won't let this happen again!

146
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:14,078
You said she's being
locked away, but by who?

147
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,954
I don't know...

148
00:09:16,789 --> 00:09:19,272
Miss Tiona is still there...

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,836
I'm the only one who
managed to escape..

150
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,215
So please, help us!

151
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:29,134
In this situation, Mia will...

152
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:33,764
Alright.
I will lend you my strength!

153
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:48,629
Guards?

154
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:50,990
What should we do...

155
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,199
What can we do...

156
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:54,368
Ladies.

157
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,580
You're Prince Sion's...

158
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,499
It's Keithwood, right?

159
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,667
To think that you'd
remember me...

160
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,919
Is there a problem?

161
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:05,714
What's happening?

162
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:08,401
Seems like Prince Sion will
dance with Princess Mia!

163
00:10:14,174 --> 00:10:17,978
To be honest, I'm getting sick just
thinking of dancing with Sion but...

164
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,689
Since I have the opportunity, might as
well make you trip and fall spectacularly!

165
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,692
Go ahead and make a fool
out of yourself in front of everyone!

166
00:10:27,943 --> 00:10:32,364
I see, I followed you
since something feels strange...

167
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,368
If I leave you ladies knowing
that you're in a pickle,

168
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,245
Prince Sion will be mad at me.

169
00:10:38,751 --> 00:10:40,514
I'll cooperate with you.

170
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,499
Really?

171
00:10:42,752 --> 00:10:44,460
But, what should we do?

172
00:10:44,793 --> 00:10:46,920
That's simple.

173
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:17,367
I thought she's a refined princess,
didn't expect for her to get this wild.

174
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:24,958
I didn't expect he'd
be good at dancing!

175
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:29,339
Look at that, that's just because Prince
Sion is good at dancing, isn't it.

176
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,843
You know that it's a meaningless dance
when only one of them is good, right?

177
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,303
Miss Rafina!

178
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:54,489
A beautiful dance that charms
everyone who watches it.

179
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,659
It can only happen because
both of their skills are high.

180
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,521
Miss Tiona! Are you okay?

181
00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:31,817
Liora?! You were safe?

182
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,655
I'm glad you're safe,
Miss Rudolvon.

183
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:39,783
You're... Mia's...

184
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:45,706
When I returned to my room,
my dress was missing.

185
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:49,335
There was a letter,
saying that if I want my dress back,

186
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:51,546
I should go to the school's north tower.

187
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:54,423
No way...
Who would do such a thing...

188
00:12:54,965 --> 00:12:57,844
Aren't they related to
you and Princess Mia?

189
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:02,431
The guards outside
were holding this.

190
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:06,477
Tearmoon Empire's crest?
No way...

191
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:10,230
Most probably,
they were hired by the Empire's nobles.

192
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,482
That might be true...

193
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,763
You're just going to besmirch
the Empire nobles name,

194
00:13:15,764 --> 00:13:18,113
so don't go to the party,
that's what they said.

195
00:13:18,946 --> 00:13:19,865
How cruel...

196
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:25,245
I don't have the leeway to
prepare multiple dresses, so...

197
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:28,750
That's why, Liora,
you didn't have to force yourself,

198
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:31,335
there's no reason why
you should rush at all.

199
00:13:31,995 --> 00:13:33,378
Miss Tiona...

200
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,468
If I was in their shoes...

201
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:47,226
Liora, please go to the city
and buy a dress there.

202
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,769
Use this for the cost.

203
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:50,395
This is...?

204
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:52,689
Princess Mia left it for me.

205
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,274
Now go!

206
00:13:58,445 --> 00:14:01,323
In the meanwhile,
I'll do your make up, Miss Tiona.

207
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:05,494
Is that okay?
For Princess Mia's maid to help them.

208
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,539
What do you mean by that?

209
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,167
Princess Mia is someone who stand
on top of the Empire's nobles.

210
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,129
If the one who lock Miss Rudolvon
here is also the Empire nobles,

211
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:20,467
there's a chance that this was
actually Princess Mia's idea, right?

212
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:25,222
Mia is the culprit?!

213
00:14:28,642 --> 00:14:31,771
There's no way that
could be possible!

214
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:32,588
Excuse me...

215
00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:37,109
Keithwood, I don't think that Princess
Mia would do something like that too...

216
00:14:38,485 --> 00:14:39,736
I see...

217
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,281
Well, if the victim herself
say so, then...

218
00:14:50,038 --> 00:14:54,001
Princess Mia, may I have one more
song, one that's more relaxed?

219
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:59,506
Isn't there someone who's much
more suitable for you, Prince Sion?

220
00:15:02,342 --> 00:15:07,514
My energy is all spent on you, so I'll
let you go with this much for today!

221
00:15:10,475 --> 00:15:11,519
I made it in time!

222
00:15:12,477 --> 00:15:13,520
What's that...?

223
00:15:14,653 --> 00:15:16,941
Prince Sion,
please give me one song!

224
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,275
Excuse me!

225
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:20,319
You're...

226
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,989
I'm Tiona Rudolvon!

227
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,533
Prince Sion, there's something
from Keithwood for you!

228
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:31,997
Confinement incident?!

229
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:34,624
I'll write here just in case,

230
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:38,128
but there's a chance that
Princess Mia might be involved.

231
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,506
As if that could happen.

232
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:46,428
I'm sure he's not
suspecting her for real too.

233
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:48,930
But seriously...

234
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:55,520
Probably, Mia saw Miss Rudolvon
while dancing,

235
00:15:56,038 --> 00:16:00,026
then with a glance,
she guessed what had happened,

236
00:16:00,275 --> 00:16:05,280
so she left her to me so that Miss
Rudolvon can still enjoy the party.

237
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:08,287
Someone's suitable for me...

238
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:13,848
So she's saying that there's
someone who needs my help, huh.

239
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:15,878
He couldn't be more wrong.

240
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:18,518
Um... Prince Sion?

241
00:16:19,169 --> 00:16:20,648
Ah, I'm sorry.

242
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,383
Miss Rudolvon,
will you dance one song with me?

243
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:29,404
Yes!

244
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,391
Prince Abel!

245
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,311
Hello, Princess Mia.

246
00:16:35,632 --> 00:16:37,354
That was a wonderful dance.

247
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,233
Thank you very much!

248
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,214
But really,
I'm not a match for him.

249
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,672
What do you mean?

250
00:16:47,864 --> 00:16:49,407
It's about Sion.

251
00:16:49,616 --> 00:16:54,871
It's regrettable, but I can't bring
out your charm as much as him.

252
00:16:57,332 --> 00:17:00,169
It's cold,
and really delicious...

253
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,006
You saw that the dance was intense,
so you brought refresher for me, right?

254
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:10,554
Prince Abel, please don't
self-depreciate yourself that much.

255
00:17:11,388 --> 00:17:12,931
It's my first time.

256
00:17:13,306 --> 00:17:16,894
For a boy around my age to treat me
kindly not as a princess,

257
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:19,563
but as a normal girl.

258
00:17:20,597 --> 00:17:23,066
You really are a
wonderful person.

259
00:17:26,236 --> 00:17:27,909
But, if possible,

260
00:17:27,911 --> 00:17:30,700
I'd like to win at dancing
against Prince Sion too...

261
00:17:31,324 --> 00:17:35,204
If that's so,
I'll give you some dance training then.

262
00:17:35,205 --> 00:17:39,166
I'll be strict with it,
so prepare yourself, okay?

263
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:49,426
And so, this is the first time Mia
had a dance that made her heart race.

264
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:51,596
But...

265
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:53,488
Confinement incident?!

266
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:56,700
Yes, so it was so and so...

267
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,939
It might be impertinent of me, but I
acted on my own as your representative...

268
00:18:01,941 --> 00:18:04,542
That's really bad!

269
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:09,321
Probably, if I don't clear up this case,
Rafina will be mad at me!

270
00:18:09,323 --> 00:18:12,739
I'm sure, it won't leave good
impression on Sion and Tiona too!

271
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,656
If that happens...

272
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:16,204
Welcome to the Guillotine route!

273
00:18:16,205 --> 00:18:17,996
No!!

274
00:18:18,371 --> 00:18:20,457
I have to do
something about this!

275
00:18:21,374 --> 00:18:24,545
Why are you deporting
our servants?!

276
00:18:24,546 --> 00:18:28,507
We're just locking up a frontier
noble's daughter anyway!

277
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,344
For the high nobles
in the capital,

278
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:37,057
they'll be forgiven when they disrespect
frontier nobles, and of course, commoners.

279
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,268
That's the value that
has rooted in the Empire.

280
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:43,773
The amount of hatred birthed
from this practice...

281
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:46,525
These people can't
even imagine it.

282
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:51,655
Sure,
what you said might be true.

283
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:56,851
But that only applies if
this place is the Empire.

284
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:02,250
Do you understand who's the ruler of
this place, where the academy stands?

285
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,085
Mia thought about it.

286
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,146
If Mia administer the judgment,

287
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:11,259
as someone from Empire
who holds the same value,

288
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,479
people will aim their
dissatisfaction to Mia.

289
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,263
So to avoid it...

290
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:16,006
That's right!

291
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:19,266
Miss Rafina is a
very virtuous person.

292
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:23,688
I don't think she'll let this case which
befalls one of her precious student,

293
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:25,855
goes unpunished, right?

294
00:19:26,314 --> 00:19:28,985
Let's push the responsibilities
to Miss Rafina!

295
00:19:28,986 --> 00:19:30,151
That's it!

296
00:19:30,902 --> 00:19:36,074
Originally, you guys will
have to leave the academy too.

297
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:37,951
No way...

298
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:41,413
But, I do pity you.

299
00:19:41,997 --> 00:19:48,169
So this time, I'm thinking of
persuading Miss Rafina in your stead!

300
00:19:49,004 --> 00:19:50,338
Princess Mia!

301
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:56,194
Those four servants who were directly
related to the case has been deported.

302
00:19:56,636 --> 00:20:02,132
Their masters, since there's not enough
proof, are in house arrest, huh...

303
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,785
Yes...

304
00:20:04,769 --> 00:20:09,150
Don't you think that
punishment is too lenient?

305
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:10,483
Princess Mia.

306
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:18,325
What should I do! Think!

307
00:20:24,748 --> 00:20:29,587
People say Yellow Moon tomato
are disgusting and waste them,

308
00:20:29,588 --> 00:20:32,672
only realize their mistakes once they
don't have anything to eat anymore.

309
00:20:34,924 --> 00:20:38,137
This is not the time to
run away from reality!

310
00:20:38,138 --> 00:20:39,762
This is totally not the time!

311
00:20:39,763 --> 00:20:41,306
- Princess Mia.
- Yes?

312
00:20:42,077 --> 00:20:47,229
So, you're saying that it's because
they don't even realize that it's bad...

313
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,563
Is that so?

314
00:20:51,232 --> 00:20:53,568
There are both sides
of a punishment.

315
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:56,530
First, is to give
assurance to the victim.

316
00:20:56,531 --> 00:20:59,742
The other one, is to have the
culprit reflect on their actions

317
00:20:59,743 --> 00:21:03,052
This time, your trusted attendant,
Anne, played a big part,

318
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,373
and managed to
minimize the damages.

319
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:08,541
And so the judgment towards
the culprits are light too.

320
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,923
It's a merciful judgment to make the
culprit repent, and improve themselves.

321
00:21:15,356 --> 00:21:20,220
So Princess Mia, you chose the most
suitable punishment for this academy.

322
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:25,351
That's totally right!

323
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:28,895
Mia doesn't really get it,
but she jumped on the boat.

324
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:33,066
As expected from the Wisdom
of the Empire, I'm impressed.

325
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:38,863
And so... Umm... Mia...

326
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:40,448
Yes?

327
00:21:41,116 --> 00:21:41,908
It's...

328
00:21:42,617 --> 00:21:44,744
Is there anything else?

329
00:21:46,454 --> 00:21:49,833
Will you become friends with me?

330
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:54,713
Sure...

331
00:21:55,196 --> 00:22:00,522
And so, the duke daughter, Rafina,

332
00:22:00,524 --> 00:22:03,776
who always send cold gaze
in the previous timeline,

333
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,990
became a friend of Mia.

334
00:22:10,937 --> 00:22:14,942
<i>To remember what went down today</i>

335
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:19,739
<i>I’ll journal every single word</i>

336
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:23,534
<i>Whether it’s good or bad</i>

337
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:27,997
<i>It’s my only life,
gotta seize the day</i>

338
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:32,418
<i>You never realize the
importance of something</i>

339
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:35,921
<i>Until it’s out of sight</i>

340
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:49,075
<i>Every beginning is
for a perfect ending</i>

341
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:54,940
<i>Dear Moon, I won’t just pray</i>

342
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:59,487
<i>Let me stand on my own
feet, just one more time</i>

343
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:05,201
<i>Sweet Moon,
not just a shiny stone</i>

344
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:09,497
<i>I’ll find sweet joy</i>

345
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:16,462
<i>And a future that is
