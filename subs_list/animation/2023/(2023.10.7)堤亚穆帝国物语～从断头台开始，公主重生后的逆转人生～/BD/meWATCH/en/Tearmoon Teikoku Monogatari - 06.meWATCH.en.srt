1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,585
Swordsmanship tournament...

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:04,087
I'm glad it's sunny.

3
00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:10,510
Miss Rudolvon and Princess Mia said they'll
bring lunchbox for Prince Sion, but...

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,764
What's with this
bad premonitions?!

5
00:00:14,764 --> 00:00:15,890
It's like...

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,768
Danger is approaching my master!

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,313
<i>A goddess! A saint!</i>
<i>Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

8
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,566
<i>Kindness! Fraternity!</i>
<i>That is it!</i>

9
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,277
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

10
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,572
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

11
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,657
<i>I am!</i>

12
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,788
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going</i>
<i>through as a helpless princess</i>

13
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,165
<i>If that's what you</i>
<i>thought, then go ahead!?</i>

14
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,834
<i>The world is always dependent</i>
<i>on the direction of wind</i>

15
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:45,628
<i>There are too many useless</i>
<i>things and people, seriously</i>

16
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:48,381
<i>I can't believe in anybody</i>

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,092
<i>I have noticed</i>
<i>that, the world is</i>

18
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,887
<i>so heartless</i>

19
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,305
<i>That is not good,</i>
<i>This is not good</i>

20
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,681
<i>It is not good,</i>
<i>everything is not good</i>

21
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,141
<i>The reality is harsh</i>

22
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,101
<i>Alteration...</i>
<i>alteration...alteration...</i>

23
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,562
<i>Everything is going</i>
<i>to be altered...!</i>

24
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:05,774
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

25
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:09,069
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

26
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,237
<i>Even in a sad scenario</i>

27
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,491
<i>I am going to rewrite</i>
<i>everything, everything</i>

28
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,785
<i>Because, because,</i>
<i>I am a princess</i>

29
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,038
<i>At least of my own story</i>

30
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,332
<i>I must enjoy it as</i>
<i>much as possible</i>

31
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,627
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

32
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,921
<i>I have to live with</i>
<i>all my strength</i>

33
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,174
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

34
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,550
<i>Just wait and see!</i>

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,180
<i>I shall alter my own destiny!</i>

36
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:42,352
A goddess! A saint!
Wisdom! Intelligence!

37
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,021
<i>A goddess! A saint!</i>
<i>Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

38
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,066
<i>Kindness! Fraternity!</i>
<i>That is it!</i>

39
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,862
Keithwood!

40
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:54,656
Are you hungry?

41
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,075
Princess Mia... What's that?

42
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,662
Listen closely...

43
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,915
This is my proud masterpiece...

44
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,875
The "Horse Bread"!

45
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,753
Horse, she said?!

46
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:13,508
Prince Abel loves horses,
so I'm sure he'll be happy!

47
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,263
Well... They do say thinking about
others is the basics of cooking, but...

48
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,974
This bread has a
critical defect!

49
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,934
Yeah, true...

50
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:26,521
Princess Mia! If it's a horse,
then the ear should be more like this...

51
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,274
That's not it!

52
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,652
If it's that big, the heat won't
reach the middle of the dough!

53
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,947
Please make it around this size!

54
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,782
My masterpiece!!

55
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,827
Keithwood,
what do you think about my veggies?

56
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,703
Yes?

57
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,583
Miss Rudolvon, seems like you're
really good at cutting veggies, huh...

58
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,378
Yes! Be it Julienning,
or mincing, leave it to me!

59
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,757
But, both Prince Sion and
Prince Abel are not herbivores,

60
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,343
so I don't think they'll be
able to eat this much cabbages..

61
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,720
Is that so?

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,847
Isn't this the normal amount?

63
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,765
What kind of "normal"
are you talking about?!

64
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,395
This savory smell...

65
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,522
Meat! I've grilled it!

66
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,193
This is...

67
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,446
You've grilled it until it
looks delicious, Miss Liora...

68
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,199
Yeah!
I grilled it in the gardens!

69
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,825
That's too wild...

70
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,119
I beg you, please use an oven!

71
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,746
That's right, Liora.

72
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,290
We're giving them to
princes after all.

73
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,168
As expected from the
daughter of Forkroad company.

74
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,503
She has proper common sense.

75
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:33,963
She even prepared a book...

76
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,675
According to this "Perfection! Recipe
for frontier style delicacies" book,

77
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:41,638
to bring out the best of the
ingredients, raw should be the best...

78
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,140
That's a no! Stop it already!

79
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:48,311
I think they'll enjoy horse
liver sashimi though...

80
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:52,690
Giving someone from equestrian club
horse meat is similar to bullying!

81
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,402
This is worse than I expected...

82
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,405
If they continue as is..

83
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,533
(Loads of cabbages)(Raw dough)
(Raw meat (Liver))

84
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,080
Princess and ladies!

85
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,917
Please listen to me now!

86
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,837
We'll turn the lunchbox into
simple sandwiches, okay?!

87
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:19,259
Isn't it better to give
something that's more complex?

88
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,636
Simple sandwich, okay?!

89
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,349
Alright, Princess Mia,
I'll let you handle the bread dough.

90
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,269
You can just make them into
squares, as usual.

91
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,020
Leave it to me!

92
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,857
Keithwood!
How about this for the salad?

93
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,110
As expected from Miss Rudolvon!

94
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,486
You're very reliable.

95
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:42,031
If only she understands "normal" amount,
I won't have anything to complain...

96
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,702
Keithwood,
I made the bread dough!

97
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,704
Alright,
let's bake them in the oven...

98
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,670
It's horse again...

99
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,510
I've told you to make them
into squares, right?!

100
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:08,391
Mia has her mind filled with Abel,
so she didn't hear the important part.

101
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,852
How is it, Keithwood?

102
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,438
It's a sandwich, you know?!

103
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,607
How will we squeeze
the inside into it?!

104
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,693
That's what I'd like to
say, but...

105
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,324
Sure... That's okay...

106
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,953
Alright!

107
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,705
It's done!

108
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,915
Our special horse sandwich!

109
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,209
We somehow made it...

110
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,129
Everyone, great job! Seriously!

111
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:43,551
The one who did the most was
Keithwood, obviously.

112
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,011
Keithwood.

113
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,891
You've really saved me, I'm grateful.

114
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,686
I don't deserve such words.

115
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,022
I'll tell them to Prince Sion.

116
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:00,860
No, I'm not talking about
Prince Sion, I'm thankful to you.

117
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,861
To me?

118
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:06,240
Because of you,
we managed to make the lunchbox...

119
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,577
That's why, thank you.

120
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:14,415
Usually, nobles won't bow their
heads to servants like us...

121
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,836
But, Princess Mia isn't bound
by such ridiculous common sense,

122
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:22,465
and tell her gratitude
to everyone normally...

123
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,300
Well...

124
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,303
Of course I'll say my
thanks to Keithwood!

125
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:31,599
I'd rather die than saying
thanks to Prince Sion!

126
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:37,146
Keithwood can't even imagine such
thoughts running inside Mia's head.

127
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,440
Welcome!

128
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,650
Come here!

129
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:44,654
It feels like the whole town
moved inside the academy!

130
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,781
Miss Mia! Miss Chloe!

131
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,326
I bought something that
looks nice from the stalls!

132
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,913
Thank you, Anne!

133
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,331
Thank you very much.

134
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,166
That looks good!

135
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,459
Let's see...

136
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,710
Miss Mia!

137
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,675
Miss Mia,
the one that you ate was...

138
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,343
Red chilli pepper!

139
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,221
It's hot...

140
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,266
It's hot!!!

141
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,601
Someone, please get some water!

142
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,727
Here.

143
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,443
Thank you very much...

144
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,404
Prince Abel!

145
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,197
I'm glad I can be of help...

146
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,241
Excuse us...

147
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,369
Prince Abel... Somehow...

148
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:36,080
Isn't it Princess Mia!

149
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,956
Ah...

150
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,209
You're Abel's brother.

151
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,712
I'm honored you
still remember me.

152
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:47,467
By the way, I heard you're making a
lunch box for my little brother today?

153
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,595
Yeah.
I gave my all and made them.

154
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,973
Well, well, that's a pity...

155
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,433
A pity?

156
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,809
Nothing...

157
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,229
It's just that Abel's
first opponent is me.

158
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,066
In other words,
he'll lose in his first match.

159
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,611
A lunchbox that's
eaten after a loss,

160
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,821
I'm sure it'll taste
quite delicious.

161
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:12,241
But really, to think that you'll
fall for my little brother...

162
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,244
I guess the "Wisdom of the Empire"
is just a kid after all.

163
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,663
You're bad at judging others.

164
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,081
Big brother!

165
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,834
Stop being rude to Princess Mia!

166
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,965
That time, I prioritized creating
connections with Prince Abel, but...

167
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,136
He's pretty bitter about it, huh...

168
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:38,434
Being at odds with the first prince
of Remno Kingdom doesn't sound good...

169
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:39,852
So for now...

170
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:44,315
Let's have Prince Abel lose,
and fulfill his brother ego,

171
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,401
then I'll comfort Prince Abel
and deepen our relationship.

172
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,986
That's it!

173
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:52,114
My biggest priority is to
evade the Guillotine after all!

174
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,368
That's why,
just answer nonchalantly...

175
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,791
I have an opponent
I want to win against...

176
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:10,508
Alright!
Please win, Prince Abel!

177
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,680
I'm sure the lunchbox will
taste better if you win!

178
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,309
Well, that's true...

179
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,437
You're pretty chummy, huh.

180
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,322
We'll begin the 7th
qualifying match!

181
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,040
Now, let me test
how much you've grown...

182
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,001
My little brother!

183
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,509
I knew it... He's strong...

184
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,345
In the end,
this is all you've got.

185
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,722
If that's so...

186
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,474
How about this?

187
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,774
But really,
you've caught a nice girl, Abel.

188
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,779
You're weak, but you're trying to
win over the Empire's Princess...

189
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,325
I'm sure father will be
pleased with you too.

190
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,409
What are you...?

191
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:23,164
If somehow, you and that princess
ended up getting married...

192
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,334
I will definitely
teach her some manners.

193
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,796
If I hurt that princess a little bit, I'm
sure she'll become obedient real quick!

194
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,676
Brother!!

195
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,262
What's this?
Quite the scary face there.

196
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:42,308
I don't care whatever
you say about me.

197
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,559
But!

198
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:48,147
If you keep on depreciating
Princess Mia more than this...

199
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,316
That's...

200
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,611
The first stance of Remno
Kingdom swordsmanship...

201
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,741
So what if I depreciate
her even more?!

202
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,284
I will...

203
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,452
Definitely...

204
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,871
Never forgive you!

205
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,051
That's it!

206
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,221
Winner, Abel Remno!

207
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,686
Prince Abel!

208
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:38,364
I won...

209
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,077
That was amazing, Prince Abel!

210
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,246
You won against your
brother on the first match,

211
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,123
and you even won the second one!

212
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,457
I expect no less from you!

213
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,500
Thank you.

214
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,585
It's all because of your
support, Princess Mia.

215
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,380
It's the fruit of your
hardwork, Prince Abel.

216
00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:00,136
If you he became that strong, he might be
able to beat that stupid Prince Sion too!

217
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,056
This is called
reliance upon others.

218
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,476
If this keeps up,
you might actually win it!

219
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,520
I don't think that's possible...

220
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,856
There's also Prince Sion after all...

221
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,816
Be more confident!

222
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,569
You're strong, Prince Abel!

223
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,862
Princess Mia...

224
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,744
Thanks for waiting.

225
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,663
Prince Sion!?

226
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:33,169
Miss Rudolvon said it's a good chance
to eat with Princess Mia and the others...

227
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,588
Tiona said that?!

228
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,592
What's with that "I did it!"
kind of expression?!

229
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,302
Are we bothering you?

230
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,470
Ah, no...

231
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,139
That's not true at all...

232
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,100
This guy...

233
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:53,355
He left me alone in the previous
timeline, yet look at his attitude now!

234
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:56,358
This sandwich looks
interesting...

235
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,068
Is it horse-shaped?

236
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,197
Prince Abel!

237
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,163
It's very delicious,
Princess Mia!

238
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,668
I'm really glad you liked it!

239
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:15,628
Yes!

240
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:19,131
This sandwich uniqueness
is that it's horse-shaped!

241
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,592
And I'm the one
who suggested it!

242
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,430
In other words, the praise for this
sandwich belongs to me, all of it!

243
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,557
Keithwood, you may cry.

244
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,100
Prince Abel.

245
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,562
Sorry it's a bit late, but congrats on
your first win against your brother.

246
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,523
Thank you

247
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,318
Actually, I have something
to apologize to you.

248
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,569
Apologize?

249
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,863
I definitely thought...

250
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,783
That you'd lose to him.

251
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,285
How rude!

252
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:52,414
There's no way Prince Abel would
lose to that dummy older brother!

253
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,209
Your judgment was correct.

254
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,920
It was luck that helped
me win against him.

255
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,298
How modest!!

256
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,300
Luck is important too.

257
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,928
It's not like I won all my matches
because of skills too.

258
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,179
That's true!

259
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,432
But, I'm honored
to be praised by you, Prince Sion.

260
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:14,019
Being acknowledged by
him is not a big deal!

261
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,271
In any case...

262
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,482
Let's make the next
match a good one.

263
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:24,405
Likewise, I hope you'll let me try
even though I'm not as good as you...

264
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,536
Princess Mia...

265
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,037
I see...

266
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,789
Princess Mia is telling me...

267
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,793
That I have to stop saying
such cowardly things...

268
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,211
Prince Abel...

269
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:44,216
Just leave him alone,
and praise my sandwich more already...

270
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:48,387
Mia was just trying to appeal
with her annoying girl tactics.

271
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,682
Princess Mia is believing in me!

272
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,017
That's why...!

273
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,269
Be prepared, Prince Sion!

274
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,356
I'm not planning on
losing this match!

275
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,110
It's for the sake of Princess
Mia who believes in me!

276
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,945
I see!

277
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,908
If that so, I'll swear to defeat
you with my full strength too!

278
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,369
Hot and passionate friendship
between two guys... How wonderful!

279
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,371
Excuse me...

280
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:20,210
How about my sandwich?!

281
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,381
And so,
the afternoon break is over.

282
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,802
Now, we'll start the next match!

283
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,515
Prince Abel...
Please win the match...

284
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,725
Win...

285
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,646
And make that stupid
Sion flabbergasted!

286
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,231
Truly spoken like a small fry.

287
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:50,324
Prince Sion is specialized at countering
whatever attack the opponent throws.

288
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,244
It's a sword skill that average
person like me can't imitate...

289
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:55,746
But!

290
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,753
This is the first stance that's
handed down in Remno Kingdom...

291
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,840
It's a skill that's specialized
to attack the opponent with speed.

292
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,593
That's the stance you used when
you defeated your brother, right?

293
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:10,427
Yeah.

294
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,723
I pour all of me into
swinging the sword faster,

295
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,433
and practiced until today...

296
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:19,269
All for the sake
of defeating you!!

297
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,200
I can't reach him yet, huh...

298
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,833
He's not... Countering me?

299
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,543
His highness...

300
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,254
He can't use his specialty,
the counters...

301
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,092
If you don't keep your guard up,
you'll lose your footing, Prince Sion.

302
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,929
I thought you said
you won't hold back?

303
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,348
I have my own circumstances too.

304
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,517
Well, in any case...

305
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,645
There's a limit
to what I can do, but!

306
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,902
I wasn't planning on looking
down on Prince Abel, but...

307
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:13,741
That first strike...
It was so heavy it made my arms numb...

308
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:18,203
To think that I'd be
cornered like this...

309
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,248
I've never had one since
that practice with father!

310
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:22,791
But really,

311
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:28,088
Prince Abel managed to analyze their
difference in strength calmly, huh...

312
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:33,135
Understand both himself and the enemy,
yet moving forward without giving up...

313
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,929
He really has the quality
to become a king...

314
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,225
And then, the one who
created this encounter is...

315
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,519
That Sion!

316
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,106
He keeps on doing petty tricks!

317
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,318
Truly speaking like a villain...

318
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,325
If you keep on evading,
there won't be an end, Prince Sion.

319
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,787
Is it Princess Mia that drives
you to become this strong?

320
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,330
Yeah, that's right!

321
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:07,669
Until now, I had been told that I can't
bridge the gap in natural talent.

322
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,922
So I ran away from
giving an effort.

323
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,343
But, I came to Saint Noelle
Academy, and met her...

324
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:19,306
And that day, it's the first time
I wanted to win against Prince Sion!

325
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:23,602
Princess Mia believed in this pitiful
me, and wished for my victory...

326
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,438
Hence why!
There's no way I can lose here!

327
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,272
I see...

328
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,525
I'm quite envious of you...

329
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:30,567
But...

330
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,152
Having to win...

331
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,196
It's the same for me too!

332
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,659
Rain?

333
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,619
Miss Mia,
you're going to get wet!

334
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,663
Please move to
somewhere with cover...

335
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,957
I don't mind this much rain...

336
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:46,708
But...

337
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:51,004
I have to see this
match until the end...

338
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,422
Miss Mia...

339
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,425
If that's so,
I'll get an umbrella!

340
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,637
See the match until the end, huh...

341
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,930
In other words...

342
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:06,311
She's trying to awaken the hidden talent
inside Prince Abel with this match...

343
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:11,525
As if I'd miss the moment
Prince Abel make that Sion lies flat!

344
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,777
This is the truth.

345
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,195
I see...

346
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:19,533
So she can't just let the talents
that people have lay dormant...

347
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,995
This is the true quality of
the "Wisdom of the Empire"!

348
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,388
I see,
so you finally got serious?

349
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,807
I've been giving my all
since the beginning...

350
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,560
Your slashing attacks
are really scary.

351
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,188
Hence why,
I'll give you a warning...

352
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:53,066
If you use the same move
again, it's your loss.

353
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,568
I see...

354
00:19:54,902 --> 00:20:00,157
If that's so, there's only one
thing I can do to defeat you.

355
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:05,370
If I change my tactics
now, I'll definitely lose.

356
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:09,208
If all those attacks
weren't effective, then...

357
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,378
So he thinks that he should do the same
attack, but with more power, huh...

358
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,881
If that's so,
I'll counter you too!

359
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,343
I'll give my all,
to hit my rival!

360
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,387
That's it!

361
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:27,434
Due to heavy rain,
we'll stop the swordsmanship tournament!

362
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,894
Stop....?

363
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,271
I knew it...

364
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,859
The tournament was made to deepen the
friendship between students after all.

365
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,611
But with this rain...

366
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,029
No way...

367
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,449
I'd really like to settle
this fight someday...

368
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,825
Prince Abel.

369
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:48,038
Will you promise me to
let me have another match?

370
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,415
Prince Sion...

371
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,001
As you wish!

372
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,636
Prince Abel!

373
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,929
Princess Mia!

374
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,058
Did you get wet from the rain?

375
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,851
We have to dry you quick,
or you'll catch cold!

376
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,228
That was amazing!

377
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:16,358
It's so vexing! Even though it's
just a bit more and you'd have won!

378
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,192
No...

379
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,736
If that keeps up,
I'll be the one who lose...

380
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:25,325
I'm sure some despicable person who don't
want you to win is doing a rain dance!

381
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:30,080
To think that they'd pour water
on a fair match, how outrageous!

382
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:35,168
That's what she said,
but in the previous timeline...

383
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:38,588
When Mia was alone
during the tournament...

384
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:40,382
That Prince Sion...

385
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:44,970
I won't let him win after
rejecting my lunchbox!

386
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,140
I hope it'll rain and the
tournament will be canceled!

387
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,226
Come rain! Come rain!

388
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:55,272
She was doing such doing such
despicable and outrageous things.

389
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,524
It was really close!

390
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,110
It's really vexing!
So disappointing!

391
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,781
Stupid rain! Stupid rain!

392
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:13,874
<i>To remember what went down today</i>

393
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:18,670
<i>I’ll journal every single word</i>

394
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:22,466
<i>Whether it’s good or bad</i>

395
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,928
<i>It’s my only life,</i>
<i>gotta seize the day</i>

396
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:31,350
<i>You never realize the</i>
<i>importance of something</i>

397
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,853
<i>Until it’s out of sight</i>

398
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:47,991
<i>Every beginning is</i>
<i>for a perfect ending</i>

399
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:53,872
<i>Dear Moon, I won’t just pray</i>

400
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:58,418
<i>Let me stand on my own</i>
<i>feet, just one more time</i>

401
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:04,132
<i>Sweet Moon,</i>
<i>not just a shiny stone</i>

402
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:08,428
<i>I’ll find sweet joy</i>

403
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:15,394
<i>And a future that is</i>
<i>sky blue and clear</i>

404
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:21,525
<i>Queen of the Night</i>

405
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:33,203
<i>I am the Queen of the Night</i>
