1
00:00:01,276 --> 00:00:03,338
It's been a while...

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,422
Saint Noelle Academy!

3
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:12,080
To think that the moment I feel happy
about going back to the academy has come!

4
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:14,374
Miss Mia, it's been a while!

5
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,335
Chloe! How are you doing?

6
00:00:17,336 --> 00:00:20,922
Great! Thank you for taking
care of my father the other day.

7
00:00:20,923 --> 00:00:26,427
My dad excitedly said that you're sure
the Wisdom of the Empire, you know?

8
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:30,414
Wow! That's quite
the overvaluation there!

9
00:00:30,415 --> 00:00:31,929
Totally.

10
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,018
Mia, Chloe, good day!

11
00:00:35,352 --> 00:00:36,812
Miss Rafina!

12
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:38,605
Good day to you too.

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,607
Good day...

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,953
I didn't know you
two were friends!

15
00:00:44,954 --> 00:00:50,407
We often talk about books
that we read, right Chloe?

16
00:00:50,408 --> 00:00:51,408
Yes!

17
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:57,458
If that's so, I'm going to get some
tea after this, why don't you join me?

18
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,435
That sounds nice!

19
00:00:59,668 --> 00:01:02,005
May I join you two as well?

20
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:05,108
Of course! Right, Mia?

21
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:09,554
Yeah! Chloe is my
best friend after all!

22
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:11,097
Best friend!

23
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:12,973
Alright, let's go!

24
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:18,712
By the way,
I heard the rumors, Mia.

25
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,757
That you're building
some kind of school.

26
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:23,609
Is that so?

27
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:29,551
And to think that you'd open it for
commoners too, quite bold, yeah?

28
00:01:30,782 --> 00:01:33,160
Yeah, that's right!

29
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:37,248
I just simply don't want Tiona's brother
to go to a school filled with nobles,

30
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:40,376
that's why I let
commoners join it too...

31
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:45,006
But, I don't think it's
that surprising, right?

32
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:50,302
Family position doesn't matter when it
comes to talents after all... Right?

33
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,517
You couldn't be more correct!

34
00:01:55,518 --> 00:01:59,187
As expected from Mia,
I'm proud to call you as a friend!

35
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:05,025
Mia's desperate excuse
pierced Rafina's heart deeply!

36
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,380
You're exaggerating!

37
00:02:09,381 --> 00:02:11,799
And so, Mia got carried away.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,428
I managed to evade the guillotine
too, so everything went well, no?

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,125
The big wave has
finally come for me!

40
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:23,710
Excuse me!

41
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:26,506
Princess Mia...

42
00:02:26,507 --> 00:02:27,798
Anne!

43
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:31,510
What's wrong?
Why are you in a hurry?

44
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,221
A revolt...

45
00:02:35,013 --> 00:02:36,974
A revolt has occurred!

46
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:42,980
Revolt...?

47
00:02:46,695 --> 00:02:49,541
What's is happening?!

48
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:53,864
What's the meaning of all
the effort that I've done?!

49
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:55,827
Please calm down!

50
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:59,162
The revolt is not
happening in Tearmoon Empire!

51
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:03,266
The revolt is happening...

52
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,169
...in Remno Kingdom!

53
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,423
Remno... Kingdom?

54
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,276
<i>A goddess! A saint!
Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

55
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,570
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

56
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,240
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

57
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:21,601
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

58
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,602
<i>I am!</i>

59
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,835
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going
through as a helpless princess</i>

60
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:31,294
<i>If that's what you thought,
then go ahead!?</i>

61
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,046
<i>The world is always dependent
on the direction of wind</i>

62
00:03:34,046 --> 00:03:36,716
<i>There are too many useless
things and people, seriously</i>

63
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,426
<i>I can't believe in anybody</i>

64
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:42,137
<i>I have noticed that, the world is</i>

65
00:03:42,137 --> 00:03:44,850
<i>so heartless</i>

66
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,351
<i>That is not good,
This is not good</i>

67
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:47,519
<i>It is not good,
everything is not good</i>

68
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,121
<i>The reality is harsh</i>

69
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:51,231
<i>Alteration... alteration... alteration...</i>

70
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:54,066
<i>Everything is going to be altered...!</i>

71
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:56,845
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

72
00:03:56,846 --> 00:04:00,073
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

73
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,242
<i>Even in a sad scenario</i>

74
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:05,479
<i>I am going to rewrite
everything, everything</i>

75
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,997
<i>Because, because,
I am a princess</i>

76
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:11,208
<i>At least of my own story</i>

77
00:04:11,208 --> 00:04:13,419
<i>I must enjoy it as much as possible</i>

78
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,506
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

79
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,884
<i>I have to live with
all my strength</i>

80
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,094
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

81
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:23,387
<i>Just wait and see!</i>

82
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:28,043
<i>I shall alter my own destiny!</i>

83
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:36,176
<i>A goddess! A saint! Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

84
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:38,761
<i>Kindness! Fraternity! That is it!</i>

85
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:44,437
A revolt in Remno kingdom..?

86
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:47,271
Excuse me, Lady Rafina.

87
00:04:47,729 --> 00:04:50,608
I heard Princess Mia is here, so I came.

88
00:04:51,108 --> 00:04:52,901
Prince Sion...

89
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,531
Everyone, please take a seat.

90
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,491
I'll prepare some tea.

91
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,579
Now then,
let's hear the rest of the story.

92
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:08,209
You said a revolt has
occurred in Remno Kingdom?

93
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,162
To be exact,
people are demanding for a revolution,

94
00:05:11,163 --> 00:05:13,088
and they're in the midst of
setting an uprising, I think.

95
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:18,010
So that means,
the revolt itself hasn't begun then.

96
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:23,181
But, according to Sunkland Kingdom
intelligence agency, "Wind Crows"...

97
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:30,106
There's a sign of civil war happening
in Remno Kingdom to bring down the King.

98
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:33,735
Then, we'll need military
intervention from Sunkland Kingdom,

99
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:37,874
to protect the people
from being oppressed.

100
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:43,118
When we got this notice, we decided it'll
better to tell you about it, Princess Mia.

101
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:46,872
We only have info that
there are signs of revolt,

102
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,835
but it's a fact that the political
situation in Remno Kingdom is bad.

103
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:53,379
Their political situation is bad?

104
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,963
What do you mean?

105
00:05:55,338 --> 00:06:01,428
In Remno Kingdom, they have high
taxes to maintain their strong army,

106
00:06:01,803 --> 00:06:05,140
but, there are rumors that the king
is trying to raise it even higher.

107
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:08,226
And there are people
who are against it too, right?

108
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,815
To represent the
people's dissatisfaction,

109
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:18,195
Remno Kingdom's prime minister, Count
Dasayev Donovan, was the first to protest.

110
00:06:18,487 --> 00:06:21,907
I know Prime Minister
Dasayev too...

111
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,868
I thought he's a wise
and friendly person?

112
00:06:25,076 --> 00:06:25,785
Yeah.

113
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:31,708
In reality, he's working as the mediator
between the King and the people, but...

114
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:36,296
Something happened
in Remno Kingdom, right?

115
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,672
Most probably...

116
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,050
What's the meaning of this?

117
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:43,262
I've managed to
escape the guillotine,

118
00:06:43,263 --> 00:06:45,722
So I thought everything
should've ended perfectly!

119
00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:51,145
I can't remember a revolt happened in
Remno Kingdom in the previous time line,

120
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:56,441
and more importantly, if it happens in
any country, I would've remembered it!

121
00:06:56,816 --> 00:07:01,446
Moreover, from all the places,
why does it has to be Remno Kingdom?!

122
00:07:01,905 --> 00:07:07,577
Well, in any case,
it's best if I stay away from danger...

123
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:12,833
Prince Abel...

124
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:16,378
Miss Mia, do you want to go?

125
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:17,505
What?

126
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:21,383
You look like you're about
to cry after all, Miss Mia...

127
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,929
That's not true...

128
00:07:27,089 --> 00:07:31,802
I've given my everything to this point
to escape from the guillotine...

129
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,275
There's no way I'm going to a place
that's on the verge of a revolt...

130
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:44,790
But...

131
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:47,867
I want to go.

132
00:07:48,451 --> 00:07:51,871
I want to go to Prince Abel!

133
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:59,296
Can you lend me some help?

134
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:04,510
Even if you want to go,
it won't be that easy.

135
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:07,846
Yeah,
we need to lay down a plan.

136
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:11,684
So that means, there's no choice but
to move behind the scenes, right?

137
00:08:11,685 --> 00:08:13,686
There must be a way.

138
00:08:13,687 --> 00:08:15,770
For now,
let's calm down and think.

139
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:17,522
Okay, Mia?

140
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:19,858
Everyone...

141
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:22,068
Excuse me...

142
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:27,033
My company's caravan group is
planning to go to Remno Kingdom...

143
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:30,285
How about you
sneak in with them?

144
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,995
Chloe...

145
00:08:32,537 --> 00:08:35,498
Miss Mia,
I'm sure it'll be fine.

146
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:40,420
Good idea, people won't be
hostile to merchants after all.

147
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:43,783
It's decided then.
If that's so, I'll be going too.

148
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:44,577
What?!

149
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:47,344
Prince Sion, that's too much!

150
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,889
Please think about
your position!

151
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:52,141
It's because I think
about my position.

152
00:08:52,142 --> 00:08:53,935
The Princess of a huge country,

153
00:08:53,936 --> 00:08:57,854
is going to dangerous area
for her schoolmate, you know?

154
00:08:58,185 --> 00:09:00,066
Prince Sion...

155
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:02,734
Miss Mia, I'll go with you too!

156
00:09:03,515 --> 00:09:08,782
I have some skills with sword too,
so I'll make sure to protect you!

157
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,784
Tiona...

158
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:17,415
Alright, I'll explain about the caravan
group, so please come to my room later.

159
00:09:21,575 --> 00:09:22,494
Anne.

160
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,126
Yes?

161
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:28,686
Unfortunately, I can't bring you
since you can't ride a horse.

162
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:29,873
No way!

163
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:31,847
But, Miss Mia...!

164
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:32,959
It's okay.

165
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,559
I'll definitely come back.

166
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,644
That's why...

167
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:40,438
You should stay,
and do your job properly.

168
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:42,732
Understood?

169
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:51,741
Miss Mia...

170
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,661
Please don't be so sad, Anne.

171
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,624
It's not the time for you to
mope away in this place, right?

172
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:01,794
But I...

173
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:04,255
I feel so pathetic.

174
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:08,675
Even though Miss Mia was being considerate
to me, who can't ride a horse...

175
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:13,054
Yet I feel like I'm just
a burden to Miss Mia...

176
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:16,182
Anne! Do you remember?

177
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:20,020
That time when Mia told me that
you're her most trusted friend.

178
00:10:21,521 --> 00:10:24,441
Anne is my most trusted
friend after all.

179
00:10:25,163 --> 00:10:26,526
Most trusted friend...

180
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:30,864
Mia told you to do your job
properly, right?

181
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:35,702
As her most trusted friend, isn't
there something that only you can do?

182
00:10:36,077 --> 00:10:38,663
Something that only I can do...?

183
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:42,834
I... I have to go...!

184
00:10:54,095 --> 00:10:56,015
It's been 3 days since
we left the academy...

185
00:10:56,016 --> 00:11:00,810
I'm sure Mia is unbearably
worried about Prince Abel...

186
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:04,440
Not only that, we're also heading
to a dangerous territory...

187
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:08,443
Even for Princess Mia,
I'm sure she's feeling anxious...

188
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,363
I'm feeling nauseous!!

189
00:11:11,364 --> 00:11:15,867
I didn't think a merchant's
carriage would shake this much!

190
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,495
We're going to cross
the border soon.

191
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:22,098
We made it safely, somehow...

192
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:26,297
Seems like Miss Chloe's strategy, and
the route that our intelligence decided,

193
00:11:26,298 --> 00:11:28,088
fits each other very well...

194
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,341
What's that?

195
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:34,929
They're bandits!

196
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,847
Bandits are attacking us!

197
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:37,888
Bandits?!

198
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:39,350
Princess Mia, come here!

199
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:41,619
What are you doing?!

200
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:44,772
So that's the bandit?

201
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:47,650
Geez, to think that
you'd scare a lady...

202
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:49,526
I'm not impressed at all!

203
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:55,657
I see, seems like you're
not normal bandits...

204
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:59,452
They're not moving
like amateurs at all...

205
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,704
Who are you people?!

206
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:04,834
Your Majesty, be careful!

207
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:07,502
Seems like he's
aiming for something!

208
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:11,799
Oh no, he got friends!

209
00:12:12,882 --> 00:12:14,259
They're coming!

210
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:21,015
They deliberately performed
a delay attack on us, quite an effort...

211
00:12:23,601 --> 00:12:25,770
What should we do, Prince Sion?!

212
00:12:26,062 --> 00:12:29,149
It feels like we're
being cornered though?

213
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,859
Stay close to me!

214
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:34,946
Even if you told me that...

215
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:40,285
Princess Mia!!

216
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,373
Princess Mia!!

217
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,815
Princess Mia, answer me!

218
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:53,840
Princess Mia!!

219
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:58,386
Prince Sion...?

220
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:01,013
Ah, I see...

221
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,848
I fell from the carriage,
into the river...

222
00:13:04,058 --> 00:13:05,018
Princess Mia!

223
00:13:05,977 --> 00:13:10,816
This kind of development, I feel like
I've read it in Elise's novel before...

224
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:15,528
To help a drowned person,
what the prince did was...

225
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,405
It was...!

226
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,701
Don't tell me, it was a kiss?!

227
00:13:20,702 --> 00:13:21,785
No way!

228
00:13:21,786 --> 00:13:26,331
I've already decided that I'll
give it to Prince Abel though!

229
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:28,791
But...

230
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,048
Sunkland way of giving
an artificial breathing.

231
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:39,469
When there's a drowned person,
quickly turn their head sideways...

232
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:40,678
Wha...?

233
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:48,270
Put in something like a finger into their
mouth, and clear up their insides...

234
00:13:48,271 --> 00:13:50,981
Thanks to Prince Sion's
masterful skills,

235
00:13:50,982 --> 00:13:54,651
Mia managed to protect
her first kiss.

236
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,862
Thank goodness,
you're breathing again.

237
00:13:57,946 --> 00:14:00,366
I thought I was dead for sure...

238
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:03,160
You're right, the rapids
were pretty dangerous.

239
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,702
That's not it!

240
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:10,208
Thank you for saving me...

241
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,962
You're too early to say thanks.

242
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,382
This place is...

243
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:18,507
It's the downstream of
the river we fell into.

244
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:22,470
Probably in the north west area
of Remno Kingdom, I think...

245
00:14:23,096 --> 00:14:27,434
So that means we managed
to get into Remno Kingdom?!

246
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:31,521
Well, we did,
but it's probably far from the capital,

247
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:34,165
and we have to go
across that mountain.

248
00:14:34,857 --> 00:14:36,359
Across that?!

249
00:14:43,241 --> 00:14:47,246
For now, at least we're
safe from catching a cold.

250
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:50,707
I'm glad Prince Sion
knows how to make a fire.

251
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,210
Well, I was taught about it
when I went on a hunt...

252
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,470
Even the perfect, superhuman Prince Sion,

253
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:07,849
acts cute in front of
a lightly dressed girl!

254
00:15:08,349 --> 00:15:15,107
But well, I'm pretty embarrassed too,
but I'm still an adult woman inside!

255
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:19,320
I have the leeway to enjoy the
embarrassed face of a cute boy!

256
00:15:19,321 --> 00:15:22,321
She's a no-good adult woman.

257
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:28,037
But I'm surprised you know the veggies
or fruits that are edible, Princess Mia.

258
00:15:28,038 --> 00:15:30,497
It's nothing special, you know?

259
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:37,003
I had to spend one night in the wild while
the revolution army chased me after all!

260
00:15:37,253 --> 00:15:40,131
That was a grueling
experience...

261
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:45,471
But now, I'm a survival expert!

262
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:49,391
I've researched all edible
foods in this continent!

263
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:52,810
Quite an amazing
attachment to life.

264
00:15:54,423 --> 00:15:56,190
By the way, Prince Sion.

265
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:58,483
I have something
I'd like to ask you...

266
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,109
What is it?

267
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:05,032
If Prince Abel were somehow involved
in the oppression of the people,

268
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,949
what will you do?

269
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,952
That's quite a sudden question.

270
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,751
Will you condemn your schoolmate if
they're involved in something bad?

271
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:22,341
If Prince Abel swung
his sword on the people,

272
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:26,051
then I'd have to point my sword to him...

273
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:30,014
Depending on the situation,
you might need to kill Prince Abel.

274
00:16:30,681 --> 00:16:32,517
It's that what you're thinking?

275
00:16:33,851 --> 00:16:37,231
But isn't it inevitable?

276
00:16:37,232 --> 00:16:39,440
I can't do anything about it.

277
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,277
Is that true?

278
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:43,111
What?

279
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:45,948
I can't do anything about it.

280
00:16:45,949 --> 00:16:49,565
That phrase is only for those who have
given their all until the very end, right?

281
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:52,995
Those who has given their all...

282
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:57,250
It's a given that you have to
condemn someone who do evil things.

283
00:16:57,471 --> 00:17:02,630
But, I've been listening to intelligence
regarding Remno Kingdom from the shadows,

284
00:17:02,797 --> 00:17:05,049
yet, I didn't even think
of doing anything about it.

285
00:17:05,425 --> 00:17:09,388
After doing all that, do I even have
the right to condemn Prince Abel?

286
00:17:09,389 --> 00:17:12,098
Is that what Princess Mia is
aiming for through this question?

287
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:19,523
Did he think that it was inevitable too
when he sent me into the guillotine?!

288
00:17:19,524 --> 00:17:23,025
Mia was enraged for an
entirely different reason.

289
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,364
Well, I had a fair share of
fault too back then, okay?

290
00:17:27,365 --> 00:17:30,617
But, if that's so, he could've said
something before the revolt happened,

291
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:35,846
like, "your attitude is pretty bad",
then things would've been better, right?!

292
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:41,835
Something could've
changed if he did that!

293
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:45,006
Especially with my
wise judgment!

294
00:17:45,381 --> 00:17:48,635
The last part was not
entirely unquestionable.

295
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:51,096
Then when everything
is already too late,

296
00:17:51,097 --> 00:17:55,057
He shows up and says "it can't be
helped", that's just too cruel!

297
00:17:55,683 --> 00:18:00,938
Or could it be, Princess Mia is
trying to stop the revolt altogether?

298
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:04,066
Before Prince Abel
did something bad...

299
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:10,531
Prince Sion's grand imagination
just kept on growing...

300
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:15,286
Are you okay, Princess Mia?

301
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,957
I'm not okay at all...

302
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:24,128
It's all because those bandits
attacked the carriage, right?

303
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,840
Bandits, huh...

304
00:18:26,841 --> 00:18:28,382
What's wrong?

305
00:18:28,883 --> 00:18:34,181
No, I'm wondering if the ones we
encountered were actual bandits or not.

306
00:18:34,182 --> 00:18:36,225
What are you trying to say?

307
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:39,811
They're obviously assassins that
has received combat training.

308
00:18:39,812 --> 00:18:43,731
There's a high chance that they're
assassins that are targeting you or me...

309
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,653
But, there shouldn't be anyone who
knows that we're in that carriage!

310
00:18:49,654 --> 00:18:53,449
I think it's obvious that
we have an information leak.

311
00:18:53,783 --> 00:18:55,076
No way...

312
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:58,621
In any case, we have to hurry
up and head to the capital...

313
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:01,082
Even if you say that...

314
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:05,044
We've been walking without
rest, and I'm hungry...

315
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,258
Wow, what pretty mushrooms!

316
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:13,363
Now that I think of it,
the head chef said this before...

317
00:19:13,681 --> 00:19:18,857
It's hard to tell if the mushrooms
are poisonous or not,

318
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:21,353
so you shouldn't
eat them haphazardly. okay?

319
00:19:21,354 --> 00:19:24,272
That's what he said...

320
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:28,551
But, I'm sure such a
beautiful mushroom is edible!

321
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:31,034
You better stop that!

322
00:19:34,532 --> 00:19:35,575
Who's there?!

323
00:19:35,783 --> 00:19:39,580
Young lady,
those are Salamandrake,

324
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:42,894
a mushroom so poisonous it can
cause rash just by holding it.

325
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:45,083
My, is that so?

326
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:48,588
More importantly, you two aren't
kids from around here, huh?

327
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,173
Where do you come from?

328
00:19:50,174 --> 00:19:52,258
We are...

329
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:55,761
It's better to
hide our identity.

330
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,847
Got it?

331
00:19:56,848 --> 00:19:58,014
Okay, okay...

332
00:19:59,056 --> 00:20:01,283
How about you, who are you?

333
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:02,644
Me?

334
00:20:02,645 --> 00:20:07,357
I'm a hunter from Doni village, Muzik.

335
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:08,358
Hunter...

336
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,029
We're both merchant child,

337
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,240
but we got separated from our parents
when some bandits attacked us.

338
00:20:16,093 --> 00:20:18,200
That's quite bad!

339
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:22,454
My village is nearby, if you're fine
with it, would you like to visit?

340
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:24,470
Is that okay?

341
00:20:24,471 --> 00:20:25,641
Wait, Mia.

342
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:32,799
We're really grateful, but we need to
reach the capital as soon as possible...

343
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,217
The capital?

344
00:20:34,218 --> 00:20:37,220
But the sun will set soon...

345
00:20:37,221 --> 00:20:41,474
I'll search for someone in the village
that's planning to go there tomorrow.

346
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:42,866
That's what he said!

347
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,577
Let's go now, Sion!

348
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:50,192
Now, welcome to my home!

349
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:51,693
Wow!

350
00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:53,945
What is this dish?

351
00:20:53,946 --> 00:20:57,783
It's my special rabbit stew.
It's delicious, you know?

352
00:20:57,784 --> 00:20:59,992
Let's dig in!

353
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,955
This is very delicious!

354
00:21:03,956 --> 00:21:08,043
Well that's great!
We got a lot, so fill up your stomach!

355
00:21:08,044 --> 00:21:09,251
Yeah!

356
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:12,004
Is there something wrong?

357
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:13,105
No...

358
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,844
By the way, there's a civil war that's
happening in Remno Kingdom now, right?

359
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,096
You're pretty knowledgeable, eh.

360
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:22,807
Has the ruckus reached
this place too?

361
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,476
Not really?

362
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:31,232
We're in the boonies, everyone is
too busy with their own daily job.

363
00:21:31,482 --> 00:21:35,903
That's right, the famine will
hit in a few years from now.

364
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:43,411
They have foods everywhere, yet a revolt
still happened, it's intriguing...

365
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:49,333
But really, I need some sweets
when thinking about hard stuff!

366
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:53,421
Mia just stopped
thinking altogether.

367
00:22:09,868 --> 00:22:13,816
<i>To remember what went down today</i>

368
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:18,989
<i>I'll journal every single word</i>

369
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,284
<i>Whether it's good or bad</i>

370
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:27,247
<i>It's my only life,
gotta seize the day</i>

371
00:22:27,248 --> 00:22:31,460
<i>You never realize the
importance of something</i>

372
00:22:31,461 --> 00:22:35,088
<i>Until it's out of sight</i>

373
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:48,100
<i>Every beginning is
for a perfect ending</i>

374
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:54,107
<i>Dear Moon, I won't just pray</i>

375
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:58,612
<i>Let me stand on my own
feet, just one more time</i>

376
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:04,201
<i>Sweet Moon,
not just a shiny stone</i>

377
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:08,497
<i>I'll find sweet joy</i>

378
00:23:08,498 --> 00:23:15,504
<i>And a future that is
sky blue and clear</i>

379
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:22,010
<i>Queen of the Night</i>

380
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:32,686
<i>I am the Queen of the Night</i>
