1
00:00:00,982 --> 00:00:03,780
In Holy Principality of Belluga,

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:07,575
that served as the home of
the Central Orthodox Church,

3
00:00:07,576 --> 00:00:09,869
Which is the main faith for
the people on the continent,

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,582
There is an elite school that
where noble children gather.

5
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,793
It's called Saint Noelle Academy.

6
00:00:18,377 --> 00:00:21,256
<i>A goddess! A saint!
Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

7
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,508
<i>Kindness! Fraternity!
That is it!</i>

8
00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:25,885
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

9
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:29,513
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

10
00:00:29,515 --> 00:00:31,474
<i>I am!</i>

11
00:00:36,228 --> 00:00:37,605
<i>Throughout life, I am on easy mode-going
through as a helpless princess</i>

12
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:39,023
<i>If that's what you
thought, then go ahead!?</i>

13
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:41,818
<i>The world is always dependent
on the direction of wind</i>

14
00:00:41,819 --> 00:00:44,779
<i>There are too many useless
things and people, seriously</i>

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,323
<i>I can't believe in anybody</i>

16
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:49,993
<i>I have noticed
that, the world is</i>

17
00:00:49,994 --> 00:00:52,662
<i>so heartless</i>

18
00:00:52,663 --> 00:00:54,205
<i>That is not good,
This is not good</i>

19
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:55,540
<i>It is not good,
everything is not good</i>

20
00:00:55,541 --> 00:00:57,083
<i>The reality is harsh</i>

21
00:00:57,084 --> 00:00:59,043
<i>Alteration...
alteration...alteration...</i>

22
00:00:59,044 --> 00:01:01,546
<i>Everything is going
to be altered...!</i>

23
00:01:01,547 --> 00:01:04,632
<i>I am a princess, as you know</i>

24
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:07,969
<i>I am the heroine in this life</i>

25
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,138
<i>Even in a sad scenario</i>

26
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:13,433
<i>I am going to rewrite
everything, everything</i>

27
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:15,727
<i>Because, because,
I am a princess</i>

28
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:18,897
<i>At least of my own story</i>

29
00:01:18,898 --> 00:01:21,316
<i>I must enjoy it as
much as possible</i>

30
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:23,985
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

31
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:26,821
<i>I have to live with
all my strength</i>

32
00:01:26,822 --> 00:01:29,615
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

33
00:01:30,073 --> 00:01:31,409
<i>Just wait and see!</i>

34
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,013
<i>I shall alter my own destiny!</i>

35
00:01:41,293 --> 00:01:43,838
<i>A goddess! A saint!
Wisdom! Intelligence!</i>

36
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:46,840
<i>Kindness! Fraternity!
That is it!</i>

37
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:50,135
Whoa!

38
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:55,794
(Episode 3
Princess Mia is sowing seeds)

39
00:01:58,602 --> 00:02:00,605
Please look, Princess Mia!

40
00:02:00,606 --> 00:02:04,942
To think that they have those
wonderful shops inside the campus!

41
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:06,860
I see...

42
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,244
So, it's finally here.

43
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:19,331
In this school life,
there are 2 rules that I mustn't break.

44
00:02:19,623 --> 00:02:24,211
First, I need to stay away from dangerous
people who sent me to the guillotine.

45
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:26,713
Especially, those two.

46
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:29,341
Sion Sol Sunkland,

47
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,761
the First Prince of
the Kingdom Sunkland,

48
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:34,681
a strong country that
equals Tearmoon Empire.

49
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:37,475
He has charming looks and
overflowing sense of justice.

50
00:02:37,476 --> 00:02:39,919
He both excel in academics
and martial arts,

51
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:44,691
this perfect prince had captured the
hearts of all girls who laid eyes on him,

52
00:02:44,693 --> 00:02:47,093
and of course Mia
is also included.

53
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:58,913
Now, come and talk to me, Prince Sion.

54
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:01,499
The only one suited to match with
a Crown Prince like you,

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,126
Is the Imperial Princess
of the Tearmoon Empire, Me!

56
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:07,879
Tiona!

57
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:12,718
Who the heck is that girl?!

58
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,678
Tiona Rudolvon.

59
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,224
A young lady from a poor
noble family that lived on the

60
00:03:18,225 --> 00:03:20,226
southern frontier of
the Tearmoon Empire.

61
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:23,505
I'll never forgive you
for ignoring me!

62
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:28,484
Mia started to bully her.

63
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,004
The grudge due to bullying
became her driving force.

64
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:34,048
Later, Tiona became a key
leader of the revolution,

65
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:35,822
through whom the anger of
the people was channeled.

66
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:38,118
And Prince Sion
aided her as well.

67
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,920
And as a result, Mia was...

68
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:46,002
I really did a foolish
thing back then.

69
00:03:46,003 --> 00:03:51,590
I did reap what I sowed,
everything came back to bite me.

70
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:55,011
But,
that was in previous timeline.

71
00:03:55,012 --> 00:03:57,972
This time, I absolutely won't
get involved with either of them.

72
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,557
Mia, look there.

73
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,647
How dare you look
at us like that?

74
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:07,773
It's Tiona!

75
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:11,401
What shall we do, Mia?

76
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:15,657
Mia would never abandon
anyone who needs help!

77
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:18,075
How will you help them, Mia?

78
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:24,415
Mia was under pressure to
make the ultimate choice.

79
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,668
Would she help her mortal enemy?

80
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,296
Or lose the trust of her
most faithful companion?

81
00:04:30,515 --> 00:04:32,907
The master is responsible
for the servant's insolence.

82
00:04:32,908 --> 00:04:34,758
That's absolutely right!

83
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:36,843
So it's the same in this place, huh?

84
00:04:37,094 --> 00:04:40,556
The nobles has grown
rotten here too.

85
00:04:40,557 --> 00:04:43,393
What shall we do?
It's going to be troublesome though.

86
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:44,534
Should we help them out?

87
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:46,437
Of course.

88
00:04:46,438 --> 00:04:50,149
Now apologize,
you country bumpkin!

89
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,691
Hurry up!

90
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:55,195
Hold on, you girls!

91
00:04:55,737 --> 00:04:57,698
Just what do you
think you are doing?

92
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:02,327
Who are you,
butting in so suddenly?

93
00:05:02,994 --> 00:05:04,539
Princess Mia...!?

94
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,582
Princess Mia..? It's impossible!?

95
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:10,545
I am the Imperial Princess
of the Tearmoon Empire,

96
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:12,754
Mia Luna Tearmoon.

97
00:05:13,088 --> 00:05:15,340
A pleasure to meet you all.

98
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:17,926
So...

99
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:23,182
Just what were you
doing, exactly?

100
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:26,853
Forcing me into a situation where I am
forced to lend a hand to my archenemy.

101
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:28,812
This warrants death penalty.

102
00:05:29,104 --> 00:05:33,860
In my eyes, it seemed that you were being
quite rude to a citizen of my empire.

103
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:36,718
No, It's just that she is
a noble from the frontiers,

104
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:38,435
so we were just teaching her
the rules of polite society

105
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:40,074
Did you misheard me?

106
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:44,619
I love each and every
citizen of my empire equally.

107
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:48,832
Even to those who are poor,
and from lower status!

108
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:54,922
I will never overlook someone being rude
or looking down upon any of my citizens,

109
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,548
whoever they might be.

110
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:04,474
Since I just helped you, you can't
complain about what I say, right?

111
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:05,767
In short...

112
00:06:05,768 --> 00:06:08,452
She wanted to say that
Tiona is no one special,

113
00:06:08,453 --> 00:06:13,844
and that she is just same as those
lowest and poorest citizens in her eyes.

114
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:16,127
I...

115
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:21,531
No, the Rudolvon family have never been
treated as citizens of the Empire...

116
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:23,659
In order to get back at all
those who'd sneered at me,

117
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:28,289
I gave my everything and
enrolled at St. Noelle...

118
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:31,958
And yet on my very first day,
I was already being harassed.

119
00:06:35,045 --> 00:06:38,382
She started crying?
Did I go too far just now?

120
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:42,844
Please wipe your face with this!

121
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:44,804
Mia!

122
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:50,393
But, she recognized me as someone
who belongs to the Empire..

123
00:06:51,061 --> 00:06:55,107
No matter how small or
powerless a person might be,

124
00:06:55,108 --> 00:06:58,109
She said she'll love and
protect them equally!

125
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,157
Tiona, please don't cry!
Are you still sad?

126
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:07,869
No, these are not
the tears of sadness.

127
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:12,958
These are the tears of joy
for a miraculous encounter.

128
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:19,756
So that's the one who they call the
Wisdom of the Empire, Princess Mia.

129
00:07:19,923 --> 00:07:24,678
I heard that she personally arranged
for a hospital to be built in the slums.

130
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:29,725
I was sure that she's a girl from a
gilded cage who doesn't know anything.

131
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:34,396
Or a person who simply have
benevolence and not much else, but...

132
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:41,591
It won't be possible to go and brush
away evil proactively with just kindness.

133
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:45,574
The quality to become the
Empress of the Empire.

134
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:48,451
She definitely has it,
there's no mistaking it.

135
00:07:51,288 --> 00:07:55,418
And so, Mia got deeply
involved with these two,

136
00:07:55,419 --> 00:07:58,461
whom she swore to never
get involved with.

137
00:08:02,632 --> 00:08:06,178
Earlier, I caught a sight
of the Imperial Princess.

138
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,848
That famous 'Wisdom of the Empire'?

139
00:08:08,849 --> 00:08:13,351
Yeah, Princess Mia!
Even her appearance is graceful.

140
00:08:30,182 --> 00:08:33,581
It is like my fatigue is being
washed away along with it.

141
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:37,292
If only I can wash away those
things which happened earlier too.

142
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:43,340
Nevertheless,
it's a really splendid bath.

143
00:08:43,882 --> 00:08:47,136
Mia, you really do like
baths, don't you?

144
00:08:47,137 --> 00:08:49,262
Well, yeah.

145
00:08:49,638 --> 00:08:56,686
Back then, I'd only ever get one bucket
of cold water once a week to clean myself.

146
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:02,221
This radiant and gorgeous skin,

147
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:04,487
these silky smooth
and beautiful hair,

148
00:09:05,357 --> 00:09:07,763
The treatment I do everyday
is showing it's result!

149
00:09:07,764 --> 00:09:10,158
I'm just like the Moon Goddess!

150
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,995
Alright, Mia,
You are all cleaned up.

151
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,623
Thank you for going through
trouble as always, Anne.

152
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:22,338
Oh right, I should wash your back
too, once in a while!

153
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:25,675
I couldn't possibly
ask you to do that!

154
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:27,969
There's no need to hold back.

155
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,928
You must be tired as well, right?

156
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,056
I'm going to make
you all smooth!

157
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:38,312
Mia...

158
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:39,854
Thank you very much...

159
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:41,523
Anne...

160
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:44,693
That's my line.

161
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,906
You stayed by my side,
even until my final moments..

162
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,664
That huge debt I owe you,

163
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:54,411
I'll be sure to pay it back,
little by little, this time around.

164
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57,247
There we go!

165
00:09:57,622 --> 00:09:59,374
Now then,
let's finally get in the bath!

166
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,710
You two get along
well, aren't you?

167
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:06,756
You... You're...!

168
00:10:07,257 --> 00:10:11,679
Rafina Orca Belluga.
The eldest daughter of Duke Orleans,

169
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,182
the ruler of the Holy Principality of Belluga
where Saint Noelle Academy is.

170
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,602
In the previous timeline,

171
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:22,606
she held the role of St. Noelle's student
council president of since she enrolled,

172
00:10:22,607 --> 00:10:26,484
and Mia was charmed by the authority
she held and tried to get close to her.

173
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:30,822
Good day, Rafina.
I trust you're well today?

174
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,286
Please excuse my rudeness, but..

175
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:38,288
Are we acquainted
with each other?

176
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,169
After that,
she tried all sorts of things,

177
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,900
but even then, she was not able
to become friends with her.

178
00:10:46,934 --> 00:10:52,552
But instead, she was looked at
if she holds no value at all.

179
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,848
To think that I'll meet her here...

180
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:59,435
I'm pleased to meet you, Rafina...

181
00:10:59,436 --> 00:11:00,852
My name is...

182
00:11:01,186 --> 00:11:04,106
The Imperial Princess,
Mia Luna Tearmoon,

183
00:11:04,108 --> 00:11:05,816
I'm glad to be able to meet you!

184
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:07,548
I've heard all sorts
of stories about you.

185
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,161
What?!

186
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:13,908
Why would this person know my name?!

187
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,259
She was completely shocked.

188
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:21,247
You're going to catch cold
out there, you know?

189
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,834
Why don't we all enjoy
the bath together?

190
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:26,628
Then, I'll take you up
on your kind offer...

191
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:28,004
Anne..!

192
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:32,468
We shouldn't share a bath when
Rafina is watching, but...

193
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:34,970
If I send Anne back to
our room without me now...

194
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:37,639
I'll be all alone with her !!!

195
00:11:37,847 --> 00:11:42,602
There's no way I can do
something so utterly terrifying!

196
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:45,438
Your maid can join us too.

197
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:50,319
In a place like this where we can
rid ourselves of clothes for a time,

198
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,488
there's no princess,
nobles and commoners.

199
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:55,157
We're all just humans.

200
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:58,077
Wouldn't you agree,
Princess Mia?

201
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,204
Certainly!
I think you're absolutely right!

202
00:12:02,038 --> 00:12:05,334
Anne!
You heard what Rafina said!

203
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:07,670
Now come and sit next to me!

204
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:08,629
But...

205
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,381
Come, come!

206
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:11,923
I understand!

207
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:19,765
You're not going to feel warm
there, right?

208
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:21,600
Come closer!

209
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:23,936
I'm fine here..

210
00:12:23,937 --> 00:12:26,605
Come, come closer!

211
00:12:26,606 --> 00:12:27,773
Mia!!

212
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:31,484
You two certainly are
close, aren't you?

213
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,239
Of course we are! Anne is my most
trusted confidant, after all!

214
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:38,993
Confidant?!

215
00:12:38,994 --> 00:12:43,163
So, if it turns ugly,
it'll be 2 on 1, okay?

216
00:12:43,164 --> 00:12:44,999
No matter if you're big shot,

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,585
my most trusted confidant
will never betray me!

218
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,464
Wait, what happened, Anne?!

219
00:12:52,465 --> 00:12:55,091
I am so sorry!!

220
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,467
I see..

221
00:12:56,885 --> 00:13:01,180
It seems like you won't bring shame to
the title of 'Wisdom of the Empire".

222
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:04,434
By the way, Princess Mia,

223
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:08,479
Do you know that there is an entrance
party being held the day after tomorrow?

224
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,026
An entrance party? No...

225
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:15,487
It's a dance party organized
to welcome new students.

226
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:17,155
You haven't heard about it?

227
00:13:17,655 --> 00:13:22,493
I thought you'd already been invited
to be someone's dance partner..

228
00:13:22,935 --> 00:13:26,472
Dance..dance...dance..

229
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:28,709
That's right!

230
00:13:28,711 --> 00:13:33,839
That infuriating time event, I completely
wiped it out from my memories!

231
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,507
To reiterate...

232
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:37,259
In the previous timeline,

233
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:42,056
Mia assumed that she and Prince Sion
being together was just a matter of time.

234
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:48,062
And of course, she was so sure that
the invitation will come from him.

235
00:13:48,063 --> 00:13:49,939
Now then, Prince Sion!

236
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,899
Hurry up and ask me
out anytime you please!

237
00:13:55,318 --> 00:13:56,194
Tiona!

238
00:13:57,695 --> 00:14:00,366
Would you grant me a dance?

239
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:07,372
And so, Mia ended up having to
suffer the festivities in loneliness.

240
00:14:08,122 --> 00:14:09,715
Something like that...

241
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:11,518
I don't want to
experience it ever again!

242
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,986
Might as well skip
the dance party...

243
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:17,048
No, I can't let my
weakness take over me!

244
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:22,428
Rafina, excuse us,
we'll be heading out first.

245
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:24,223
Okay.

246
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:26,849
I'll look forward to seeing
you at the dance party.

247
00:14:28,017 --> 00:14:31,641
The second rule which I must
obey in this academy Life,

248
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:37,902
Establishing as many useful connections
as possible in case there is a revolt.

249
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:39,446
That's right!

250
00:14:39,447 --> 00:14:43,783
This dance party is the perfect
chance for building up connections.

251
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,453
In order to avoid
the guillotine,

252
00:14:46,454 --> 00:14:48,705
I have to make different
choices this time.

253
00:14:49,414 --> 00:14:52,542
Mia,
what happened to you suddenly?

254
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:57,381
Let's begin the
strategy meeting.

255
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:58,841
For what?

256
00:14:58,842 --> 00:15:03,928
I want to learn how to
find an ideal partner.

257
00:15:04,721 --> 00:15:10,351
For that, Anne, I'll need the full
extent of your romance knowledge!

258
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:17,494
Whatever fleeting feelings
Mia had for Ludwig,

259
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,697
has been hidden as a secret feelings
in the storage of her heart!

260
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:24,947
Then, a new love interest?

261
00:15:24,948 --> 00:15:28,161
Right! Most probably it'll
happen in this academy!

262
00:15:31,914 --> 00:15:34,168
I understand, Mia!

263
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:39,757
I, Anne, will bare every drop of
knowledge in my body and my soul for you!

264
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:42,383
Let's come up with a
perfect love-strategy!

265
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:43,876
Yeah!

266
00:15:49,774 --> 00:15:53,811
According to Anne's investigation,
it should be about time...

267
00:15:56,397 --> 00:15:59,025
Right on cue! Prince Abel!

268
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:04,631
Abel Remno, Mia's classmate and
second prince of the Remno Kingdom,

269
00:16:04,632 --> 00:16:08,634
which boasts an excellent military
power among mid-sized nations.

270
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:12,677
Even before entering the academy,
Mia had decided to make him her target.

271
00:16:13,122 --> 00:16:17,895
It's easier to get second prince or
later to marry into the Empire,

272
00:16:17,896 --> 00:16:20,646
because they have less
right to the throne.

273
00:16:20,906 --> 00:16:21,690
Also...

274
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:25,663
His country, The Kingdom of
Remno is across Sunkland.

275
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:27,054
In other words,

276
00:16:27,055 --> 00:16:29,807
If I can make Prince Abel falls for me,

277
00:16:29,808 --> 00:16:32,017
when the Sunkland Kingdom attacks,

278
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:36,105
I can ask him for reinforcements and
we can do a pincer attack on them!

279
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:39,102
Mia is self-serving as usual.

280
00:16:40,858 --> 00:16:43,112
Prepare yourself, Prince Abel!

281
00:16:43,113 --> 00:16:46,280
I'll show you the perfect
first impression act!

282
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:50,076
There's only one romance
strategy that we should do..

283
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:53,538
Now is the time!

284
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,208
Handkerchief-drop strategy!

285
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:02,505
I did it, Anne!!

286
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,386
And when your target
picks up your handkerchief,

287
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:10,931
Say thanks and casually ask
him if he has a partner yet.

288
00:17:10,932 --> 00:17:14,560
And if he hasn't
made plans yet...

289
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:17,769
Just show him your Mia-smile,
and most probably...

290
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,314
No, for sure!

291
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:22,609
Princess,
will you dance with me..?

292
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:24,277
...It will end up like that!!

293
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,157
That's an absolutely
brilliant strategy, Anne!

294
00:17:28,158 --> 00:17:32,093
You're like the grand strategist
who leads the Empire's army!

295
00:17:32,326 --> 00:17:34,745
Now all I have to do is wait
for him to call out to me!

296
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:45,007
Why didn't he pick up the handkerchief?

297
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:47,008
Just where did the
Prince Abel go...?

298
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,180
Is there something amiss, my lady?

299
00:17:51,181 --> 00:17:53,615
Ohh yeah, I completely forgot!

300
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:57,102
That person was a complete
and total playboy!

301
00:17:57,103 --> 00:17:59,897
If Abel were to choose between
a handkerchief and a girl,

302
00:17:59,898 --> 00:18:02,649
he would always choose the girl.

303
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,028
Abel Remno is regrettably a
smug and handsome playboy.

304
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,843
Did someone drop this?

305
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,997
Prince Sion?!

306
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:20,375
Why, of all people,
does it have to be him to pick it up?

307
00:18:20,376 --> 00:18:23,253
Excuse me,
did anyone drop a handkerchief?

308
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:24,171
Oh no!!

309
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:27,257
I can't let him know that that's
my handkerchief, no matter what!

310
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:29,176
Ah, that belongs to Mia.

311
00:18:29,177 --> 00:18:31,093
Tiona!!

312
00:18:31,427 --> 00:18:35,723
She lent me this yesterday,
so I'm sure of it.

313
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,976
This is bad!!

314
00:18:37,977 --> 00:18:40,965
That combination is the worst
pair to be called out by!

315
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:42,605
Seriously!

316
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:45,399
Ah, Mia is over there!

317
00:18:47,902 --> 00:18:50,447
Mia! You dropped this!

318
00:18:50,448 --> 00:18:52,950
Oh... You're right!

319
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:55,118
I must have dropped it by accident?

320
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,162
Thank you very much
for telling me.

321
00:18:59,622 --> 00:19:01,458
It's a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

322
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:05,169
I am the prince of the Kingdom
of Sunkland, Sion Sol Sunkland.

323
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,756
I have heard a lot of things
about you, Princess Mia.

324
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:11,343
How courteous of you.

325
00:19:11,344 --> 00:19:13,511
I am Mia Luna Tearmoon.

326
00:19:14,345 --> 00:19:16,055
Now then, excuse me...

327
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,308
What a perfect timing
for us to meet.

328
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:20,352
Princess Mia, I'm sorry but...

329
00:19:20,353 --> 00:19:22,687
have you decided on your
partner for tomorrow's dance?

330
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:26,357
If you haven't,
I'd like to offer myself for it.

331
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,571
Why, why did it turn like this?!

332
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:33,657
If I become Sion's
dance partner,

333
00:19:33,658 --> 00:19:37,202
it would definitely be the start of
a connection between the two of us.

334
00:19:37,203 --> 00:19:40,330
And if that happens,
and I make a single mistake...

335
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,000
I absolutely don't
want it to happen!

336
00:19:44,667 --> 00:19:50,007
But, if I turn him down here,
I'll leave a bad impression,

337
00:19:50,008 --> 00:19:58,765
And no one will invite "The Princess who
turned down a Crowned Prince", right?

338
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:01,435
Just what should I do...?!

339
00:20:01,436 --> 00:20:02,561
Abel!

340
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:03,644
Get over here!

341
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:07,899
That's...

342
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,276
This is...

343
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:11,402
Please excuse me for a moment!

344
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,988
This is my chance to escape!

345
00:20:17,742 --> 00:20:19,160
Brother.

346
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:24,082
Abel,
what the heck are you doing?

347
00:20:24,332 --> 00:20:27,377
I was doing was just searching for
a partner for tomorrow's dan...

348
00:20:29,211 --> 00:20:31,673
Quite a barbaric person.

349
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:34,635
If you have the pride
as royalty of Remno,

350
00:20:34,636 --> 00:20:36,802
then you should train
your sword skills more.

351
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:39,513
If you do that then maybe
women would come to you.

352
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:46,270
Although I don't think any decent
woman would come to a loser like you.

353
00:20:48,564 --> 00:20:50,483
What are you doing there!

354
00:20:51,776 --> 00:20:53,528
What's up with you...

355
00:20:53,529 --> 00:20:57,491
Don't worry much about it, it's just
a siblings quarrel, little missy.

356
00:20:58,074 --> 00:21:02,704
So why don't you act like a
good girl and scram? Okay?

357
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:05,624
Did I scare you?

358
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:06,999
My bad, my bad!

359
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:10,921
What a brat!

360
00:21:10,922 --> 00:21:12,255
Such intimidation,

361
00:21:12,256 --> 00:21:16,405
compared to Revolutionary army who
threatened to beat me to death constantly,

362
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:18,511
it's just like a threat
from a feisty kitten.

363
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:21,739
In the end, he's just a pampered little
prince who grew up with silver spoon!

364
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:24,101
What's so funny?

365
00:21:24,102 --> 00:21:25,602
Oh dear, how rude of me.

366
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:32,409
However, I'll be troubled if you
hurt my dance partner's face.

367
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:38,548
Prince Abel, you've already
asked me out to be your dance partner,

368
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:41,827
yet you forgot about it and
acting kind to the other girls.

369
00:21:41,828 --> 00:21:45,538
That's why these kind of things
happens to you, Prince Abel.

370
00:21:48,332 --> 00:21:53,255
Apologies for not introducing myself
until now, First Prince of Remno.

371
00:21:53,256 --> 00:21:58,134
My name is Mia Luna Tearmoon,
Imperial Princess of the Tearmoon Empire.

372
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:02,389
And, just as you said before,

373
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,890
I am the indecent woman who
approached your brother.

374
00:22:09,854 --> 00:22:13,942
<i>To remember what went down today</i>

375
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:18,905
<i>I’ll journal every single word</i>

376
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:22,451
<i>Whether it’s good or bad</i>

377
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:26,955
<i>It’s my only life,
gotta seize the day</i>

378
00:22:26,956 --> 00:22:31,293
<i>You never realize the
importance of something</i>

379
00:22:31,294 --> 00:22:34,796
<i>Until it’s out of sight</i>

380
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:48,142
<i>Every beginning is
for a perfect ending</i>

381
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,065
<i>Dear Moon, I won’t just pray</i>

382
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:58,445
<i>Let me stand on my own
feet, just one more time</i>

383
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:03,992
<i>Sweet Moon,
not just a shiny stone</i>

384
00:23:03,993 --> 00:23:08,179
<i>I’ll find sweet joy</i>

385
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:15,145
<i>And a future that is
sky blue and clear</i>

386
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:21,551
<i>Queen of the Night</i>

387
00:23:21,552 --> 00:23:33,687
<i>I am the Queen of the Night</i>
