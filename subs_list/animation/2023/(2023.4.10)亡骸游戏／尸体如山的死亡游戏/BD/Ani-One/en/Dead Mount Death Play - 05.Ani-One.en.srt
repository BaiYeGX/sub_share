1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,640
Don't rush to take action first.

2
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,130
If he was originally here to kill,

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,530
someone should have already died by now.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,930
Does that mean we can relax?

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,480
That's hard to say.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,800
Trying to understand
the thoughts of Lemmings is futile.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,400
Mr. Iwa.

8
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,260
Anyway, this guy is a wanted criminal.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,480
Defeat him and arrest him.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,730
Don't forget that this is
all happening in front of everyone.

11
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,800
Polka, Polka.

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:46,260
He's probably even scarier than that cop.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,930
I can tell.

14
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,640
Is that the soul of the person
"that guy" killed?

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,860
Hatred and fear are struggling inside?

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,610
Your arm strength is pretty good.

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,730
I don't know how your
abdominal muscles are trained, though.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,820
I did remind you that
we're in front of everyone.

19
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,110
This guy really underestimated me.

20
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,100
Are you looking for me?

21
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,610
Huh? Is this a new way
of hitting on someone?

22
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,930
Misaki!

23
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,260
No, I can't use magic
in front of the police.

24
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,040
If anything goes wrong,

25
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,530
my peaceful life will be gone forever.

26
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,330
I couldn't live peacefully
if I became "that guy's" enemy.

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,910
Arase!

28
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,150
He and Shagrua are similar,
even though they have different traits.

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,260
He was born as a human
but exists beyond normal logic.

30
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,220
The only choice in front of me is

31
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,370
to abandon her and run away.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,950
Polka.

33
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,330
Maybe it's because
I failed to reincarnate.

34
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:46,260
Master, it seems that

35
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,150
I have become an irreparable idiot.

(Dead Mount, Death Play)

37
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:23,170
(Episode 5: The Monster)

38
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,800
What is that?

39
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,220
Polka?

40
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,560
Although I can't see anything,
you must be Polka, right?

41
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,110
Be quiet. Hurry up and run away now.

42
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,620
What was that sound just now?

43
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,880
Can you see everything in the dark?

44
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,310
Misaki!

45
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,330
That's not something
that can be said casually.

46
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,310
I know someone will get angry if I say it,

47
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,680
so let's end the conversation here.

48
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,330
It's a pity.

49
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,420
Wait, don't act too hastily.

50
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,670
He is an honest child and
has nothing to do with this matter.

51
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,620
So, now that I've told you everything,

52
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:52,860
are you satisfied?

53
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,260
If you're still not satisfied,
let me offer you some benefits.

54
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,260
She wants to use
the paralyzing effect of saliva.

55
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,320
I can't even bite through this bandage.

56
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
I was just kidding around.

57
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,660
We indirectly kissed,

58
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,980
you should be happy about it.

59
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,740
Only relying on the saliva
left on a licked fork,

60
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,460
it's impossible to fully achieve
the numbing effect.

61
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,600
But thank you anyway.

62
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,820
Thanks to you, I finally calmed down
and set up the magic.

63
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,880
This scene is really miserable.

64
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,960
I thought I could easily defeat him,
but I couldn't even lift a finger.

65
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Let's bring all our equipment next time.

66
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,010
You guys are talking so lightly.

67
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:17,420
Sorry, since encountering
that kind of monster,

68
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,740
my courage is not big enough
to try to fight it barehanded.

69
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,600
The place where you are sitting
is a non-smoking area.

70
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,580
You're back, Lemmings

71
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,460
You've been gone for a long time.

72
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,780
It's not common for you.

73
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,180
What?

74
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,420
Is it?

75
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,040
Jimba has already been killed.

76
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:51,120
Whoever did it doesn't matter anymore.

77
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,160
I look forward to
your performance in the future.

78
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,420
Nezu.

79
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,380
Anything else?

80
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,600
Really?

81
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,940
That guy is like
an urban legend similar to Shinjuku.

82
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,280
They always appear silently

83
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,120
and complete their work

84
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,180
as if they are everywhere,

85
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,340
so they are called the Lemmings

86
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,660
Fortunately, you guys are safe.

87
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,560
Yeah, we are really lucked out.

88
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,760
However,

89
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,960
Polka should've used up
a lot of magic this time.

90
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,540
I replenished a lot of magic from

91
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,700
the grudges around the bandaged man.

92
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,280
Thank you.

93
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,080
Why are you thanking me?

94
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,220
You helped me.

95
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,400
Did you tell him

96
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,180
what can't be said?

97
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,440
No problem.

98
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,420
You also saved me.

99
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,800
It's mutual.

100
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,840
If you feel like helping someone,
whether you just met them

101
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,880
or have known them for five years, do so.

102
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,740
Boy,

103
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,660
perhaps you will live through
a considerably long life where no matter

104
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,460
if it is one second or a hundred years,
it will not make much difference for you.

105
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,260
Therefore,

106
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,060
measuring things with
the length of time has no meaning.

107
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,920
The longer your life is lived,

108
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,720
the more emotions will
accumulate within you

109
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,320
and at critical moments

110
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,820
they will make your body
take action unconsciously.

111
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,720
With this fragile body of mine,

112
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,040
I am unable to protect anyone,

113
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,100
let alone take care of myself.

114
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,300
Misaki.

115
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,360
Takumi.

116
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,580
And the real Polka.

117
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,540
I know nothing about this world

118
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,010
and there are many things
I want to ask you,

119
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,760
including your own affairs.

120
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,220
What's wrong? Why so serious?

121
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,080
I have thoroughly understood that

122
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,760
no matter how short the time
we spend together,

123
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,560
I don't need to sacrifice the people
who once laughed with me

124
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,560
in exchange for a peaceful life.

125
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,100
I didn't expect him to still be alive.

126
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,260
You completely fooled me.

127
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,640
Polka.

128
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,340
Game over.

129
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,700
So

130
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,980
I want to work.

131
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,080
Work?

132
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,320
After yesterday's incident,
I finally figured it out.

133
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,820
My magic power is not enough yet.

134
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,840
If I want to have
a stable life in this world,

135
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,080
money is essential.

136
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,320
I deeply understand this.

137
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,400
Are you going to come out
with that large skeleton again?

138
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,380
It will attract the
Mobile Investigation Team.

139
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,400
Spirit of Dead Thread
can be used for combat,

140
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,680
but it has many other uses.

141
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,080
For example,

142
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,420
signing a contract with a self-aware soul

143
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,360
and allowing it to possess something
to make it move.

144
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,640
That's my mechanical pencil.

145
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,540
It fell to the ground,
let me borrow it for a moment.

146
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,760
Sure.

147
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,340
The underground of this building

148
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,680
has rational souls.

149
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
I made a contract with it and
tried to possess the mechanical pencil.

150
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,080
YOU AND CLARISSA, WHO WORKS AS AN INTERMEDIARY, HAVE A CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP. IT IS MY GREAT HONOR TO MEET YOU ALL.

151
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,120
Its writing is unexpectedly good.

152
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,020
I AM HOSOROGI, WHO DIED HERE FIVE YEARS AGO.

153
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,020
Amazing!

154
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,840
But the things written down
are quite shocking.

155
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,560
Only I can engage in this kind of business
that uses magic to make a living.

156
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,840
Perhaps I can monopolize this market.

157
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,840
Actually, I have
even prepared the shop sign.

158
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,232
ANY COMMISSION - THE SHOP IS AWESOME

159
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,460
How is it?

160
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,420
I can help out too.

161
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,620
Do you want to live a peaceful life?

162
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,820
I am well aware that your true identity
is a terrifying monster.

163
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,920
As someone like me, a small character,
you could easily kill me.

164
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,340
But I still have to say it.

165
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,300
Is there something wrong with your head?

166
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:07,168
I HAVE AN IDEA TO EARN MONEY

167
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,020
I saw that

168
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,020
your profession is

169
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,480
related to medical care.

170
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,340
You are right.

171
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,400
I can feel that there is a blockage
of air in your right leg.

172
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,080
You're correct.

173
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,740
My right leg was fractured recently and
I am currently undergoing rehabilitation.

174
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,380
Why did it start moving?

175
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,920
Playing games should
be done in moderation.

176
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,960
Did you even know
about this kind of thing?

177
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,800
It's amazing that you can actually
make money from this.

178
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,320
Very impressive, right?

179
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,500
It's hard to imagine.

180
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,120
The mechanical pencil
itself even drew the sign.

181
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,480
You earned 100 000 Yen in just one week.

182
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,940
However, divination?

183
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,600
If you want divination to
look like the real deal,

184
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,700
you need to master cold reading
and hot reading techniques.

185
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,180
In fact, you have done it
quite convincingly.

186
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,220
Based on the name and date of birth
written by the client at reception,

187
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,880
I gather information and

188
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,020
share it by using this eye as a tool.

189
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,020
Then we rely on the power of Polka.

190
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,520
I died last month because of overeating.

191
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,420
You lost someone important
to you last month.

192
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,900
How do you know about this?

193
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,020
The key to opening the door to a new life

194
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,320
must be engraved on
the tombstone in the courtyard.

195
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,660
Tombstone?

196
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,180
The tombstone of Little Mi,
our cat who died last year?

197
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Could it be

198
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,000
the password for the safe?

199
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,820
We together created you,
a skilled diviner who never misses a shot.

200
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,460
But no matter what,

201
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,960
in the eyes of others, your mechanical
pencil is just a trick to deceive them.

202
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,080
IT'S BEST IF THEY HAVE SUCH THOUGHTS.
AT FIRST, THEY CAME OUT OF SUSPICION TO INVESTIGATE.

203
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,210
THEN THEY WILL ALL BECOME
PAWNS LAID DOWN FOR MORE EFFECTIVE BRAINWASHING.

204
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,840
You called it brainwashing?

205
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,000
After all, Polka's wish
is to have a stable life.

206
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,660
These are the first earnings
I've made in this world.

207
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,320
Let's split it equally among five people.

208
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,480
Five people?

209
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,080
Me, Misaki

210
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,340
Takumi, real Polka and Mr. Hosorogi.

211
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,060
You are really someone
who follows the rules.

212
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,500
What's wrong with you?

213
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,040
Just consider this money as
a thank-you gift for borrowing this body.

214
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,540
Is it trying to express that
it doesn't want to accept this money?

215
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,560
Hmm, it says that
it hasn't been able to help with anything.

216
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,080
That's true. Money shouldn't be
a surprise to the real Polka.

217
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,500
I remember you once saying you couldn't
retrieve all of your memories.

218
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,040
Actually, the home of Polka Shinoyama is…

219
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,300
Hey, hey, what's going on?

220
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,540
Oh my, did we disturb everyone?

221
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,420
Greetings to everyone.

222
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,680
We found it, we found it!

223
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,420
Polka is actually here.

224
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,160
It's been half a month
since we last met, right, Uncle Polka?

225
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,100
Hmm, could it be…

226
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,920
They are Kazuki Shinoyama
and Shizuki Shinoyama,

227
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,740
the twin siblings.

228
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,120
And they are also
the nephew and niece of this body.

229
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,740
The situation is not good. I have to
figure out a way to bluff my way through.

230
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,000
Did you guys mistake me for someone else?

231
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,420
I am the Corpse God

232
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,000
from a distant land.
A wizard who mistakenly arrived here.

233
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
What is that for?

234
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,460
And what does the name "Corpse God"
mean anyway?

235
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,720
Corpse God, a temple for corpses?

236
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,360
It sounds pretty cool, though.

237
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,520
Is that so?

238
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,080
Don't worry, Shizuki.

239
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,080
He was probably influenced by
those two commoners.

240
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,060
If it weren't for that,

241
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,800
Uncle Polka wouldn't escape from home.

242
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,540
It's really bad.

243
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,620
If they noticed I'm not Polka,

244
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,000
a peaceful life would be far away from me.

245
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,340
Never mind, let's put
this matter aside for now.

246
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,520
We came here today as guests.

247
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,880
Can you show us

248
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,500
your expertise in divination?

249
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,420
That's a silly question.

250
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:22,840
Everything depends on opportunity.

251
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,120
Please come back next time.

252
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,720
We will be open from 10am tomorrow.

253
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,180
Young lady,

254
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,190
can you please go back first today?

255
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,480
Oh my, how strange.

256
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,140
I don't remember
allowing you to interrupt me.

257
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,380
A commoner dares to give me his opinion.

258
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,560
If I say no, what are you
going to do about it?

259
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,580
I will call the police.

260
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,940
According to common sense, I should do so.

261
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,480
You led a group of people to
aggressively break into the closed store.

262
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,660
As a frightened ordinary citizen,

263
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,040
my only choice is to call the police.

264
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,000
What?

265
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,160
You're really joking.

266
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,560
Do you know who we are?

267
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,520
A person who belittles someone
they just met without hesitation

268
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,480
is nothing but a vulgar nouveau riche.

269
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,680
I am…

270
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,660
Please calm down, young lady.

271
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,540
This guy might be recording

272
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,420
or even broadcasting live on site.

273
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,140
It's not wise to reveal
our identities here.

274
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,240
What's wrong?

275
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,740
Are you asking those guys in black

276
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,560
to beat me up

277
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,540
because you can't win an argument with me?

278
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,700
You're going too far.

279
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,740
It's enough now, thank you.

280
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,440
I know

281
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,260
you intentionally drew attention
to yourself for me.

282
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,760
This girl

283
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,540
is about to cry.

284
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,560
Wh-What nonsense are you talking about?

285
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,520
Hey Polka, what are you doing…

286
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,300
Did you just ask me to do
a divination for you?

287
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,260
Don't worry.

288
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,160
You have a future.

289
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,740
Rest assured, I will protect you.

290
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,520
Wh-What are you talking about?

291
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,920
You're just Polka.

292
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,340
You've got the wrong person,

293
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,680
but I know Polka.

294
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,800
He said,

295
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,780
"I will go home tomorrow,

296
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,220
so you guys can go back today."

297
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,960
Okay, I got it.

298
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,880
Don't worry about it.

299
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,900
Can someone save these two children?

300
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,600
I will protect them.

301
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,220
Calling it an evil spirit
is not quite accurate.

302
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,140
I can feel that it wants to
protect those two people,

303
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,500
but its mind is a bit unclear now.

304
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,080
Do you believe what it says?

305
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,700
I cannot just sit and watch.

306
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,040
You are really kind-hearted.

307
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,700
Hmm, yes, a little.

308
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,160
They made me recall
those children who loved to act tough.

309
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,520
I see.

310
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,760
Hey, hey.

311
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,140
Are you really going back
to Polka's house tomorrow?

312
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,240
Yes.

313
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,020
Where is his house?

314
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,900
Where was it again?

315
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,220
Take this.

316
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,160
Shinoyama conglomerate,

317
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,620
centered around Shinoyama Bank,

318
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,520
has total assets of several trillion Yen.

319
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,680
Although not the richest,

320
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,600
it is also wealthy and influential.

321
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,060
So, Polka,

322
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,620
you are the second son of the current head

323
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,360
of the Shinoyama family, Rozan Shinoyama.

324
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,280
Your father, Rozan,
is already 79 years old this year.

325
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,020
If something unexpected happens to him,

326
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,140
Polka has the right to
inherit his inheritance.

327
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,340
This could be a reason for
someone to target your life.

328
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,080
Oh no, my peaceful life.

329
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,760
Why is Polka himself also surprised?

330
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,880
As I said before,

331
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,520
we don't know who commissioned
Misaki to kill Polka.

332
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,340
But it's very likely that

333
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,560
it was someone from your family.

334
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,680
When you go home at this timing,

335
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,720
it's like rushing into enemy territory.

336
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,300
Do you have a way to deal with it?

337
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,920
Huh? Polka should be able to handle it.

338
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,480
Only if he can use the magic openly.

339
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,740
When I was alive,
there were guards following me

340
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,840
like double-toothed tiger zombies

341
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,740
and skeleton-heavy armored cavalry.

342
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,480
The things you mentioned are becoming
less and less related to peace.

343
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,980
I AM A SILENT GUARD, PLEASE DO NOT ASK TOO MUCH.
How about this?

344
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,100
If someone rich uses this as a guard,

345
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,820
they will soon become poor.

346
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,180
Does the guard have to look like a human?

347
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,440
Looks like a human…

348
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,460
Hey? What are you guys talking about?

349
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,400
What's the deal with Polka?!

350
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,480
He always looks timid,

351
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,220
but suddenly he acts like an elder.

352
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,960
Is he really Uncle Polka?

353
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,240
Bro Takeru.

354
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,780
Why did you go out so late at night?

355
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,380
Kazuki, Shizuki.

356
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,680
Very sorry.

357
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,440
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,900
How was it?

359
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,060
Is Polka doing well?

360
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,840
Yes.

361
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,140
He said he would go home tomorrow.

362
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,460
I see.

363
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,860
That is really something to
look forward to.

364
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,200
Having said that, we still need to
send a "nanny," just in case.

365
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,600
You guys should be careful too.

366
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,120
After all, no one can say for sure
if the same "accident"

367
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,020
that happened to Suzuka

368
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,960
will happen again.

369
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,400
Is that so?

370
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,620
Polka is safe and sound.

371
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,920
He started a Shinjuku
witchcraft business unexpectedly.

372
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,000
He really resembles you,

373
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,540
Kanon.

374
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,460
It seems like

375
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,380
I can't die yet.
