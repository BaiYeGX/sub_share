1
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:04,926
Um…

2
00:00:05,666 --> 00:00:06,676
Sis Sayo?

3
00:00:06,996 --> 00:00:10,096
The reason why I came here today
is because I plan to settle down here.

4
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:16,646
From now on, please take care of me.

5
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:21,886
Why do you want to stay here?

6
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:38,688
(Dead Mount, Death Play)

7
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:57,236
I'll explain the reason later.

8
00:01:58,386 --> 00:02:00,796
Do you need me to introduce myself first?

9
00:02:03,186 --> 00:02:04,416
Yeah.

10
00:02:05,676 --> 00:02:08,036
I can't possibly tell her that
I knew who she is all along.

11
00:02:09,726 --> 00:02:11,476
I'm Sayo Shinoyama.

12
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:14,226
I am Polka's niece,
but I'm older than him.

13
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:16,626
This person is my sidekick,

14
00:02:17,056 --> 00:02:19,996
supposedly a trainee butler named Lei.

15
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:21,476
What do you mean by supposedly?

16
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:23,596
Because I have just found out today.

17
00:02:25,276 --> 00:02:27,106
I'm Xiaoyu Lei.

18
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:28,846
Nice to meet you.

19
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,026
I am Takumi Kuruya.

20
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:33,676
I am Polka's business partner.

21
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:35,856
And this person over here…

22
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:37,906
You must be Misaki. Long time no see.

23
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,586
We met again.

24
00:02:41,026 --> 00:02:43,506
So, Sis Sayo, why did you come here?

25
00:02:50,816 --> 00:02:51,646
Sharks.

26
00:02:51,856 --> 00:02:52,656
Sharks?

27
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:56,046
The sharks were all burned.

28
00:02:58,476 --> 00:03:00,226
Right, they've all been burned.

29
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:04,706
It's like what happened in the kitchen
of Marine Medical Research Institute.

30
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:07,836
That chef is amazing.

31
00:03:09,346 --> 00:03:10,596
Lady Sayo's room was

32
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:13,116
destroyed by fire today.

33
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:16,226
Many of her shark-related items

34
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,756
were burned.

35
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:22,016
In addition, Lord Rozan asked me
to bring a message to you.

36
00:03:24,046 --> 00:03:25,666
Oops, sorry about that.

37
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:28,526
I wanted to have a good chat
with you on the phone,

38
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,856
Unfortunately, police and firefighters
will ask me about the situation later.

39
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:35,956
Polka's and Sayo's rooms
were both burned down.

40
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,486
So I apologize.

41
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:39,376
Let Sayo and the young man
who serves as her guard

42
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:42,156
stay with you for a while.

43
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:45,836
However, this is just a
superficial reason.

44
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:50,096
If two people from my family were
to live in that building,

45
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:53,346
it would be more convenient
in various aspects.

46
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,116
I can feel the increased surveillance

47
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:59,456
around this building,

48
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,456
and there's also him.

49
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:02,756
That's all.

50
00:04:03,616 --> 00:04:06,176
The people of Shinoyama
have already learned about here,

51
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:08,864
so Rozan sent out his own people

52
00:04:08,896 --> 00:04:11,136
as personal bodyguard to come here.

53
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:12,816
However,

54
00:04:13,106 --> 00:04:16,996
there is also a possibility that Sis Sayo
may be a suspect attempting to kill Polka.

55
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:19,456
Sand Sharks and Avalanche Sharks,

56
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:20,786
which one do you prefer?

57
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:21,876
I like both!

58
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:26,716
If it really is her,
it would save me a lot of effort.

59
00:04:38,076 --> 00:04:40,176
Good morning. What a wonderful morning.

60
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,926
Morning.

61
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:46,626
This kind of morning can
make people feel energetic.

62
00:04:47,676 --> 00:04:48,756
Don't you think so?

63
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,516
Hmm, I do feel that way indeed.

64
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:53,716
Well, I don't think so.

65
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:59,636
But I will respect your opinion.

66
00:05:00,096 --> 00:05:01,056
Good night.

67
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:04,066
What is she talking about?

68
00:05:04,336 --> 00:05:05,556
Good morning.

69
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:06,996
I am sorry.

70
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:09,476
The young lady has not yet recovered.
She is still frightened.

71
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:10,946
She may just want to lie down

72
00:05:11,246 --> 00:05:12,716
and sleep for the moment.

73
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:15,876
If you want me to crawl out
of my sleeping bag,

74
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,436
I recommend trying shark bait.

75
00:05:20,516 --> 00:05:21,966
Yeah, you wish.

76
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:24,846
We need to find an empty room,

77
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:26,516
tidy it up, and let them stay there.

78
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,586
Let's go buy a set of mattresses
in Don Quijote.

79
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,356
You can't keep sleeping
on the floor all the time.

80
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:35,006
As long as I have a shark sleeping bag,

81
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:37,406
I can sleep anywhere.
So there's no need to worry about it.

82
00:05:38,496 --> 00:05:40,386
I can fall asleep even while standing up,

83
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:41,536
so it's not a problem.

84
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:43,326
How could that not be a problem?

85
00:05:43,996 --> 00:05:46,036
No problem. Don't worry.

86
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:48,206
Taking care of the young lady's

87
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:49,636
daily life is my responsibility.

88
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:54,576
Speaking of which,

89
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,866
why were you sent
to take care of Sis Sayo?

90
00:05:57,616 --> 00:06:01,236
I was chosen because my name
is similar to lady Sayo's.

91
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:03,196
What a hasty reason.

92
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:05,266
Besides serving as the bodyguard
of the young lady,

93
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:08,996
I also have to act as a liaison
for young master Polka.

94
00:06:09,616 --> 00:06:10,786
I see.

95
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:13,406
What is the current situation at home?

96
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:16,706
There's no need to use
honorifics with me, young master Polka.

97
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,216
In the courtyard of the Shinoyama,

98
00:06:19,486 --> 00:06:21,716
it seems that a group of
police officers have come today.

99
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:25,166
Therefore, it is better for us
not to go back temporarily.

100
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:28,336
I see. I see.

101
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:32,386
When you came to your senses, the arsonist
was controlled and transferred to police.

102
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:34,626
Who are they?

103
00:06:35,086 --> 00:06:36,896
Police officers.

104
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:40,756
No way.

105
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,156
Oh.

106
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:47,136
I thought the police interrogation
had already ended yesterday.

107
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:50,496
Nice to meet you.

108
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:53,056
Our department is somewhat
different from others.

109
00:06:53,636 --> 00:06:56,156
Please cooperate with our investigation.

110
00:06:56,736 --> 00:06:57,996
Mr. Takeru Shinoyama.

111
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,576
So, the true identity of
the arsonist from yesterday

112
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:04,816
is perhaps the Firestarter.

113
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:08,046
Yes, it might be.

114
00:07:08,976 --> 00:07:10,956
But I really can't immediately
believe such claims.

115
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:12,686
If it is true as you say,

116
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,076
and I heard that
the culprit has already died,

117
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:19,116
can I assume there will be no more fires
caused by the Firestarter?

118
00:07:19,886 --> 00:07:22,516
I never said that.

119
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,096
It's just that

120
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:25,966
in order to reveal the truth,

121
00:07:26,016 --> 00:07:28,286
we must investigate
this matter thoroughly.

122
00:07:32,676 --> 00:07:35,676
The Firestarter was originally
the enemy of Shinoyama Security.

123
00:07:36,316 --> 00:07:38,606
He burned down several buildings
that we were responsible for,

124
00:07:39,106 --> 00:07:40,386
and we really can't afford to lose face.

125
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:44,116
We don't know when the police will be able
to catch him and bring him to justice,

126
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:45,756
so we are very worried.

127
00:07:46,706 --> 00:07:49,246
This is harsh.

128
00:07:49,776 --> 00:07:50,786
Furthermore,

129
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:53,406
even if you catch him,

130
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:54,656
it will be meaningless
if he escapes later.

131
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,156
What a dagger in the heart.

132
00:07:58,676 --> 00:08:00,516
Aren't you two from
Shinjuku Police Station?

133
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:03,676
Is it alright to waste time here?

134
00:08:04,466 --> 00:08:07,246
Tena Sorimura, nicknamed
Phantom Solitaire.

135
00:08:08,036 --> 00:08:11,166
-He was active in Shinjuku.
-Catch me if you can.

136
00:08:12,256 --> 00:08:15,116
The prime minister's
kidnapping incident in the past

137
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,836
has implicated even unrelated people like
us, resulting in a drop in stock prices.

138
00:08:19,356 --> 00:08:20,356
We hope that the police

139
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:22,516
can prevent our stock prices
from continuing to fall.

140
00:08:24,236 --> 00:08:25,756
I look forward to

141
00:08:26,596 --> 00:08:27,776
all of your positive performances.

142
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,086
The two people following him

143
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,826
are probably acting as assassins.

144
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:37,136
Really?

145
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,426
I can feel it just from the atmosphere,

146
00:08:39,876 --> 00:08:43,356
especially from that man.
I smell a similar scent on him.

147
00:08:43,776 --> 00:08:44,736
A similar scent?

148
00:08:45,086 --> 00:08:49,246
He's likely a violent person.

149
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,266
In other words,

150
00:08:51,936 --> 00:08:54,196
he's a jerk.

151
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:56,946
That sounds quite scary.

152
00:08:57,876 --> 00:09:00,336
Go tell Tozawa and Yatsu that

153
00:09:00,766 --> 00:09:01,776
depending on the situation,

154
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:04,236
we might have conflicts with Shinoyama.

155
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:06,866
Have you had any clues?

156
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:12,516
That's a photo displayed in their home.

157
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,306
You should remember

158
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:15,826
the person on the far left, right?

159
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:17,486
He is…

160
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:19,406
He's Polka Shinoyama.

161
00:09:19,796 --> 00:09:20,876
Rozan's second son,

162
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:23,596
which means he's the
young master of Shinoyama.

163
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:25,856
However, it seems that
he is not at home now.

164
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,066
He appeared at the scene
of the fire yesterday.

165
00:09:28,836 --> 00:09:31,506
So he's one of the Shinoyama?

166
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,626
And the girl with glasses
who was with him

167
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,486
left her footprints
at the scene of Human Knot.

168
00:09:38,556 --> 00:09:40,396
It is said that there was a dispute
between the group of people

169
00:09:40,686 --> 00:09:43,676
who are tied together and an organization
under the Shinoyama Group.

170
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:47,516
In the past month, calamities
have been occurring frequently.

171
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:50,676
Is Polka or Takeru Shinoyama

172
00:09:51,516 --> 00:09:53,356
at the center of this series of events?

173
00:09:54,436 --> 00:09:56,416
Let us discover the truth behind it.

174
00:09:57,276 --> 00:09:58,336
Yeah.

175
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:01,586
Tsubaki Iwanome?

176
00:10:02,516 --> 00:10:04,926
He used to have
an affair with the inspector,

177
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:06,516
causing chaos within
the police organization.

178
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:10,066
Neither bribery nor
pressure worked on him.

179
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:11,906
Do you want me to kill him?

180
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:15,516
There's no need to bother. Just let it be.

181
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:18,256
I hope he can unravel

182
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:20,336
the mystery surrounding Polka.

183
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,646
Speaking of which,

184
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:23,966
it seems that Grandpa

185
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:26,336
is up to something.

186
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:34,576
Sis Sayo, you can use this room.

187
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:36,836
Sorry that we need you
to help move things.

188
00:10:37,124 --> 00:10:38,468
It's okay.

189
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:41,508
By the way, are you really going
to sleep in such a small room?

190
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:43,460
Yes, no problem at all.

191
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,084
Thank you very much for helping us.

192
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:48,436
Good night.

193
00:10:52,756 --> 00:10:54,020
There are more people living here now.

194
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:55,652
It feels like
it's getting more interesting.

195
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,886
Yeah.

196
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,376
But speaking of which, Polka,

197
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:30,624
how do you plan to
arrange those two people?

198
00:11:31,056 --> 00:11:33,856
Well, after all, the divination house
is reopening tomorrow.

199
00:11:34,368 --> 00:11:35,696
How should I explain it to them?

200
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:47,856
Although I'm not sure
why Master trusts him,

201
00:11:48,864 --> 00:11:50,512
nevertheless, let me
reveal his true identity.

202
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:53,376
This imposter Polka Shinoyama.

203
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:56,688
What do you mean, Master?

204
00:11:57,872 --> 00:11:59,328
Just like what you heard,

205
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,168
can you accompany Sayo to go to Shinjuku?

206
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:10,688
I got it, Master.

207
00:12:10,928 --> 00:12:13,312
I just have to kill the fake Polka, right?

208
00:12:13,808 --> 00:12:14,912
Exactly the opposite, you fool.

209
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,808
You are already a guard of the Shinoyama.

210
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,272
There's no need for
you to do the dirty work.

211
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:23,792
That polka is indeed fake,

212
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:25,632
but he is not an enemy.

213
00:12:26,016 --> 00:12:27,008
Why?

214
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:29,008
Is the real Polka alive?

215
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:32,928
How should I put it?
He's still relatively safe.

216
00:12:33,376 --> 00:12:35,168
Anyway, I can't explain it clearly to you.

217
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:38,304
But I am sure about that guy's identity.

218
00:12:39,424 --> 00:12:42,016
You need to protect Sayo
and the fake Polka.

219
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,104
Can you do it, Xiaoyu?

220
00:12:47,024 --> 00:12:48,576
Well, there's nothing I can do.

221
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:52,016
After all, I cannot go against your order.

222
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:55,616
If you don't want to, it's fine.

223
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:56,832
It's okay, I'll just do it.

224
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:59,712
I will protect them.
You can rest assured, Master.

225
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:02,464
This is an opportunity.

226
00:13:03,184 --> 00:13:05,088
Let me get rid

227
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,880
of the poisonous insects that
get close to Master,

228
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:08,618
and

229
00:13:08,928 --> 00:13:10,144
if the real Polka is still alive,

230
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:11,776
I will get rid of him as well.

231
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,872
Moreover,

232
00:13:14,288 --> 00:13:15,472
a fragile guy like him

233
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:18,400
is actually the Master's son.
I cannot accept this at all.

234
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,592
I am far more

235
00:13:20,944 --> 00:13:22,800
useful than Polka

236
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,632
and better suited to be Lord Rozan's son.

237
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:35,152
I am not broken yet.

238
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:37,392
He can't be saved anymore.

239
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:41,248
Unexpectedly, he encountered
Agakura on his first job.

240
00:13:41,872 --> 00:13:43,984
He only lost his limbs,

241
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:45,856
which is fortunate in misfortune.

242
00:13:47,056 --> 00:13:49,248
From now on, let's use Xiaoyu
as the t'ing-fu.

243
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:51,584
No way.

244
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,568
No, Father.

245
00:13:54,064 --> 00:13:55,968
I still have value. I am still alive.

246
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:58,016
Don't do it. This isn't real. Save me.

247
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,408
Why, Father?

248
00:14:00,352 --> 00:14:02,704
No. Stop it. Save me. Kill you!

249
00:14:02,896 --> 00:14:04,224
If you dare to do anything to me,
I will kill you.

250
00:14:04,464 --> 00:14:06,512
Go die, go die.

251
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:08,944
Hey, what's t'ing-fu?

252
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,136
Lord Rozan.

253
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,992
I'm afraid you can't bear to hear that.

254
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,120
In its literal meaning,
the so-called t'ing-fu

255
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,456
is the vessel that has been
passed down in our family.

256
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:19,568
The toxins contained in the poisons we use

257
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:22,480
can only be cultivated using

258
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,344
the organs of living children.

259
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:28,160
Don't say it so terrifyingly.

260
00:14:28,688 --> 00:14:31,072
Are you planning to use
your own son for that kind of thing?

261
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:34,208
Forgive me for being presumptuous,
but people of our family,

262
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:36,576
whether parents or children,

263
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,336
are not considered "humans"
but rather "objects."

264
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:41,040
Showing compassion towards broken objects

265
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:44,384
is equivalent to disrespecting
our family and our work.

266
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:48,736
This matter is closely
related to your safety.

267
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:50,976
Please do not interfere.

268
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,368
Oh, I see.

269
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:55,024
If you just treat him as an "object",

270
00:14:55,408 --> 00:14:57,376
then it shouldn't be
a problem for me to buy him.

271
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,178
What?

272
00:14:59,504 --> 00:15:03,136
Don't use "He's an important family member"
as an excuse to refuse to sell to me.

273
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:06,464
As the "hand" of our family,
he does not have any value.

274
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:08,464
But he still has value as a t'ing-fu.

275
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:10,960
We will not sell him cheaply to you.

276
00:15:11,488 --> 00:15:14,592
Well, this isn't a
bad thing for you either.

277
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:19,392
I'll prioritize the offer of the latest
technology of Shinoyama Group,

278
00:15:20,112 --> 00:15:22,624
so you can keep working in this field,

279
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:23,936
even if it doesn't involve
making those poisons.

280
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,448
What were they discussing just now?

281
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:30,800
Don't treat me as a good person.

282
00:15:31,312 --> 00:15:33,184
I just want to get test subjects

283
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:35,120
for testing the latest prosthesis.

284
00:15:36,048 --> 00:15:37,744
Another thing is,

285
00:15:38,352 --> 00:15:40,240
if you could move, it would be great.

286
00:15:41,536 --> 00:15:44,608
Just keep me company and
chat with me about my family.

287
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:50,064
When was the last time

288
00:15:50,976 --> 00:15:52,240
someone smiled at me?

289
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,672
Master.

290
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,768
The Shinoyama is not just
a wealthy family.

291
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:05,552
They have connections

292
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,984
with both the underworld and
legitimate organizations.

293
00:16:08,864 --> 00:16:12,752
I heard that there is also
a killer organization like mine.

294
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:15,712
So you're saying the person
who entrusted us to kill Polka

295
00:16:15,968 --> 00:16:18,704
is probably not from
the Shinoyama family, right?

296
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:21,296
Instead of hiring assassins from here,

297
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:25,368
they might as well
let their own men shoot him dead.

298
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:27,152
It's hard to say.

299
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,648
If I were in the same
position as the client,

300
00:16:30,648 --> 00:16:32,736
I would probably also
seek help from external parties.

301
00:16:33,488 --> 00:16:37,424
It would be manageable if Polka Shinoyama
was hated by the whole family.

302
00:16:38,016 --> 00:16:39,840
But he is the son favored

303
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:41,838
by the head of the family,
Rozan Shinoyama

304
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:43,776
If they assign their own man to kill him

305
00:16:44,016 --> 00:16:46,480
and that person betrays them,
they will lose everything.

306
00:16:47,232 --> 00:16:48,336
As for the actual situation,

307
00:16:48,688 --> 00:16:50,832
what kind of people are
on the assassin team

308
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:52,592
employed by Shinoyama?

309
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,128
Let me think.

310
00:16:54,544 --> 00:16:55,920
The most frequently mentioned
one is the Lei family,

311
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,738
which has bases in Shanghai,
Hong Kong and Yokohama.

312
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,560
Although it doesn't have a rare title,

313
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:05,568
the situation of the Lei family related
to Shinoyama is quite special.

314
00:17:06,288 --> 00:17:07,888
They are known as Heilei.

315
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,056
They are a family that has combined
old and new technologies,

316
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:14,016
including ancient poisons
passed down through generations

317
00:17:14,288 --> 00:17:17,760
and the latest technology
provided by Shinoyama.

318
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:21,168
Their range of expertise
is extremely wide.

319
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:26,128
Anyway, let's just do it as usual.

320
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,728
Yes.

321
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,464
Sis Sayo should know that
I am engaged in divination.

322
00:17:31,536 --> 00:17:32,976
That thing you mentioned yesterday,

323
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:34,832
if I remember correctly, it is called
the poison dragon, right?

324
00:17:35,328 --> 00:17:36,848
Are there any other types of dragons?

325
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:41,328
Lewd and Cruel Dragon Marufi,

326
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,264
who impersonated attractive men and
women to deceive the royal family.

327
00:17:44,032 --> 00:17:46,016
Although it is a formidable troublemaker,

328
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,928
it fell in love with a general from
Imperial Gorgeous Unit.

329
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:52,592
During the disintegration of the Empire,
it ran away with the general.

330
00:17:53,184 --> 00:17:54,592
It's so romantic

331
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,112
to fall in love with a dragon.

332
00:17:56,544 --> 00:18:00,576
And there are Steam Dragon Goronson
and Bladedragon Murm.

333
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,496
The material of the dragon
has a high value in trading.

334
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:07,712
If you want to make a zombie dragon,
you must buy the whole piece.

335
00:18:08,272 --> 00:18:09,792
These two guys have only been talking

336
00:18:09,848 --> 00:18:11,456
about games, comics,

337
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,184
or light novel since just now.

338
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:15,776
What's going on?
Are they high school students?

339
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:19,584
And what is that clanging sound?

340
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,752
It feels like piles of bones dancing.

341
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,176
Isn't this just a waste of magic?

342
00:18:26,368 --> 00:18:28,336
It's fine.

343
00:18:29,072 --> 00:18:31,008
Are they playing games?

344
00:18:31,504 --> 00:18:33,040
It doesn't sound like it though.

345
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,036
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THE REMAINING AND CONSUMED AMOUNT
It seems like he's writing something.

346
00:18:35,036 --> 00:18:36,320
OF MAGIC IN NUMBERS THROUGH DATA COULD BE DISPLAYED, JUST LIKE IN GAMES.
It seems like he's writing something.

347
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:37,920
Could it be that they are playing TRPG?

348
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,064
This is the sound of dice rolling.

349
00:18:40,768 --> 00:18:41,712
Speaking of which,

350
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:43,408
that guy's name is Xiaoyu, right?

351
00:18:43,968 --> 00:18:45,584
He is very dedicated to his work.

352
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
Even at this time, he hasn't slept yet.
It seems like he's protecting Sis Sayo.

353
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:49,948
He hasn't slept?

354
00:18:50,384 --> 00:18:52,592
He is standing in front
of Sis Sayo's room.

355
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,478
This guy has sensed my presence again.

356
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:58,608
There are no surveillance cameras
or anything like that here.

357
00:19:00,368 --> 00:19:01,328
I'm going back.

358
00:19:01,632 --> 00:19:02,592
I see.

359
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:05,280
He wanted to remind me that
he is well aware of the situation here.

360
00:19:07,184 --> 00:19:08,080
It's fine.

361
00:19:08,432 --> 00:19:10,416
Let me bet with the blood of Heilei.

362
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:12,368
Even if I have to
stake Lord Rozan's reputation,

363
00:19:13,088 --> 00:19:15,760
I will gradually reveal
your true identity.

364
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,440
SHINJUKU POLICE STATION

365
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,408
Listen carefully.
You all need to remember clearly.

366
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,624
This person is Polka Shinoyama, aged 16.

367
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:26,528
The one who acted with him is the girl A,

368
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:29,200
who left footprints at the scene
of the Human Knot incident.

369
00:19:30,224 --> 00:19:31,616
Who painted that picture?

370
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:33,152
It's me.

371
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:36,576
His mother, Kanon Shinoyama, passed away.

372
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:38,704
Although I would like to say that

373
00:19:39,104 --> 00:19:40,592
he is the young master
of a wealthy family,

374
00:19:41,008 --> 00:19:42,944
it seems that the actual situation
is much more complicated.

375
00:19:45,104 --> 00:19:47,984
Polka Shinoyama has now left his home.

376
00:19:48,512 --> 00:19:50,480
Besides going in and out of
Clarissa's bar,

377
00:19:50,864 --> 00:19:53,664
according to himself,

378
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:55,504
he seems to be friends with
the intelligence dealer, Takumi Kuruya.

379
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:59,056
In addition, he told Arase
something strange.

380
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,176
My parents sold me, so I'm not very
knowledgeable about this sort of thing.

381
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:03,392
THEY WENT TOGETHER
TO THE SHINOYAMA HOUSE? GIRL A

382
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:06,000
Currently, we are not sure about
the meaning of his words.

383
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:08,720
It is also difficult to determine whether
there is a connection with this incident.

384
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:09,952
However,

385
00:20:10,384 --> 00:20:11,616
the words that people speak,

386
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:13,952
regardless of their truthfulness,
have their own meanings.

387
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,528
As long as we explore the true meaning
and make him doubt himself,

388
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:19,008
we can see through his true intentions.

389
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:23,600
I investigated the whereabouts of Polka.

390
00:20:23,904 --> 00:20:24,992
To my surprise,

391
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:27,824
he has become a diviner in Shinjuku.

392
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:31,328
I bet Solitaire is thrilled. How annoying.

393
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,200
What?

394
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:40,864
GAME OVER

395
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:42,528
Have a nice day.

396
00:20:42,832 --> 00:20:45,200
I didn't expect that in such
a short time when I was in prison,

397
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:48,016
VR technology would evolve to this level.

398
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:49,648
It's truly amazing.

399
00:20:50,112 --> 00:20:51,344
Civilized progress can also

400
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:54,336
bring innovation to the world of magic.

401
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:56,624
Huh? Is that Tena Sorimura?

402
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,824
So now it's time

403
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:05,920
to start thinking about what
to perform after six days.

404
00:21:06,672 --> 00:21:09,952
As for what actions
the police will take in this week,

405
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,176
I'm really looking forward
to checking them out.

406
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:16,896
Hey! Stop there!

407
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,696
What I'm looking forward to is
not this kind of solo action.

408
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:22,672
Bye, Akechi.

409
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,728
The second me and the third me
are finally going to appear.

410
00:21:27,776 --> 00:21:29,152
FORTUNE TELLING
I haven't dressed up like this for a while.

411
00:21:30,048 --> 00:21:31,600
We suddenly decided to reopen.

412
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:33,248
Will there be any customers?

413
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,728
After all, we have been
closed for many days.

414
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:40,768
Oh, sorry. We will work in the afternoon.

415
00:21:44,144 --> 00:21:45,200
Hey.

416
00:21:45,744 --> 00:21:47,712
The last time we met
was at Clarissa's bar.

417
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:49,760
Polka Shinoyama.

418
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,880
Hi.

419
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:58,208
Can you help me with divination?

420
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:40,063
