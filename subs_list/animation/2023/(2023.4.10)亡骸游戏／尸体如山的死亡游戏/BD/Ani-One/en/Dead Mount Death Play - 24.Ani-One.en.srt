1
00:00:01,786 --> 00:00:05,026
Unifying this peninsula was once
the empire's long-cherished wish.

2
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:07,926
Although it is said to
be for future peace,

3
00:00:08,166 --> 00:00:10,466
it's also true
that I have blood on my hands.

4
00:00:11,646 --> 00:00:14,366
So, my dear friend,
don't wear such an expression.

5
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:17,866
It's not your will
that drives you to kill me.

6
00:00:23,206 --> 00:00:24,546
Corpse God.

7
00:00:24,806 --> 00:00:27,586
No, Rizdilusia Redrazalf.

8
00:00:29,526 --> 00:00:32,746
I've finally got out of
that Wandering Balcony

9
00:00:33,606 --> 00:00:38,386
and bound your name
by a curse hidden behind the corpse.

10
00:00:39,246 --> 00:00:42,966
Let me write a new chapter
for your destiny.

11
00:00:56,066 --> 00:01:00,146
Well, let's hide the key evidence first.

12
00:01:01,586 --> 00:01:04,686
The testimony given by the souls
controlled by the necromancers

13
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:07,166
is not enough to serve
as material for defense.

14
00:01:08,806 --> 00:01:11,686
I can't believe I would cover
for a criminal who killed me.

15
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:13,966
That's why life is fun.

16
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:17,266
Now I am your accomplice.

17
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:20,206
You killed me, your dear friend.

18
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:24,106
I want you to live forever
and ever to atone.

19
00:01:30,486 --> 00:01:33,726
I'm not saying so to bind you.

20
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:37,486
You're still so foolish, my dear friend.

21
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:43,926
Are you going to kill yourself
over someone again like this?

22

25
00:03:18,746 --> 00:03:19,826
Alright.

26
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:24,386
Although I don't know why
you're so attached to this world.

27
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:26,906
And what did you say about
returning the body?

28
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:29,126
I see.

29
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:32,406
So, as a necromancer
you're merely possessing a body?

30
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,746
Yes.

31
00:03:35,306 --> 00:03:38,106
Next, I will possess your body.

32
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,066
I…

33
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,486
sympathized with that guy's desire

34
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,886
to live in peace.

35
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:50,446
How did this happen?

36
00:03:51,026 --> 00:03:52,106
Darn it.

37
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,606
Why did I become like this?

38
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:57,626
This is so not me. Darn it.

39
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:05,166
Hey, Polka!

40
00:04:06,406 --> 00:04:09,326
You, don't underestimate us anymore.

41
00:04:10,066 --> 00:04:11,166
Kurupon?

42
00:04:11,326 --> 00:04:12,766
What's that about just now?

43
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:15,546
How can you just start saying goodbye?

44
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,486
You said you don't fit in with this world?

45
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,586
I do fear your power.

46
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:25,846
I thought I could never
have anything to do with you.

47
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:26,986
But

48
00:04:27,246 --> 00:04:30,906
you, me, Misaki,

49
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:34,086
and the real Polka,
we've been sincere partners.

50
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:35,446
However,

51
00:04:35,646 --> 00:04:37,426
you just said goodbye to us?

52
00:04:37,626 --> 00:04:40,066
Didn't you tell me before?

53
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:44,766
I have no secrets more important
than my friend's life.

54
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:47,346
Don't underestimate your friends.

55
00:04:47,766 --> 00:04:50,926
And Misaki and I are

56
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:54,986
to help you fit into this world.

57
00:04:56,886 --> 00:04:58,506
Power outage?

58
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,226
I've hacked into your power
and surveillance systems.

59
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:05,546
Anyway, you shouldn't be
caught on public surveillance.

60
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:09,766
You don't have to pretend
to be good or bad,

61
00:05:10,426 --> 00:05:12,506
just do what you want to do.

62
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:13,786
Corpse God.

63
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:16,546
Takumi.

64
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:20,326
I see.

65
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:24,146
Those people in that building
are the chains that bind you.

66
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:26,666
Then I'll just deal with them first…

67
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:29,906
What are you going to do with them first?

68
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:32,786
Your vibe has changed again.

69
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:34,686
Yes.

70
00:05:34,826 --> 00:05:36,666
I don't have to pretend to be bad anymore.

71
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:40,406
I know what you're going to do.

72
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:42,666
So let me say it again.

73
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:44,746
I will stop you.

74
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,466
Gems?

75
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:48,226
Are they used to replace magic?

76
00:05:48,686 --> 00:05:50,166
But that's a lot.

77
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,466
For everyone…

78
00:05:53,106 --> 00:05:54,106
No.

79
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:56,386
This is my wish.

80
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:59,826
For the peace of the city…

81
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:13,966
Where did he get all these magic gems?

82
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:17,526
Even if you say so, but
aren't you also using others?

83
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:20,826
You used that body and
the wealth of Polka Shinoyama.

84
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:26,466
This is the money I have earned and
the assistance from my important friends.

85
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:29,486
Yes.

86
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:32,506
Someone willing to help me
when I'm immature.

87
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:34,566
No matter in this world,

88
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,646
or in that world, it's the same.

89
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,906
Don't underestimate your friends.

90
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,446
Right.

91
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:51,286
Is your wish the peace of the city?

92
00:06:52,106 --> 00:06:53,726
It's over.

93
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:58,186
Only a small fraction of those
were killed by my attack just now.

94
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:01,666
No matter how you destroy the cameras,

95
00:07:01,866 --> 00:07:05,346
there's too many dead to hide.

96
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:08,246
Neither you nor I can hide it.

97
00:07:09,986 --> 00:07:12,126
You got one thing wrong.

98
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:16,426
Today, not a single person
would die in this city.

99
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:19,466
Because I was prepared in advance.

100
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:22,286
Could it be…

101
00:07:22,686 --> 00:07:26,166
There are hardly
any people alive in the city now.

102
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:29,286
This place is already in my temple.

103
00:07:29,986 --> 00:07:32,046
This place is full of dead people.

104
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:34,846
Did you set up a barrier
to disperse the people?

105
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:38,526
So I don't have to control power anymore.

106
00:07:41,466 --> 00:07:43,626
How's it going?

107
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,426
I'm very sorry.

108
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,906
We can't get close yet.

109
00:07:48,266 --> 00:07:49,626
The enemy is sniping.

110
00:07:50,026 --> 00:07:52,306
It seems to hinder us.

111
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:58,086
This is the best we can do.

112
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:02,146
I leave this district of Shinjuku to you.

113
00:08:03,046 --> 00:08:05,246
You make the call from now on.

114
00:08:06,466 --> 00:08:08,406
That bat is just like you.

115
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:11,106
Why don't you want to change the world?

116
00:08:11,426 --> 00:08:14,406
Isn't that a waste, even a blasphemy,

117
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:19,686
of your own power?

118
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,806
That's not true.

119
00:08:22,226 --> 00:08:26,166
After all, there is someone
far stronger than me

120
00:08:26,766 --> 00:08:28,706
who also desires peace.

121
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:32,406
I, a stupid corpse,
was raised to be an assassin

122
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,386
under the control of an enemy necromancer.

123
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:38,866
Even a useless corpse like me,

124
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:43,426
that powerful man still
considers me his dear friend.

125
00:08:46,766 --> 00:08:48,526
Who are you talking about?

126
00:08:49,146 --> 00:08:50,286
I've told you.

127
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:53,326
I have support from important friends.

128
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:55,686
Thanks to their support,

129
00:08:55,966 --> 00:08:58,266
I also received that person's help.

130
00:09:02,366 --> 00:09:04,966
You finally called me here.

131
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:09,266
Sorry, it took me a long time.

132
00:09:09,726 --> 00:09:12,686
There's something I want
to protect no matter what,

133
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:17,146
please help me, Your Majesty.

134
00:09:18,506 --> 00:09:19,526
No.

135
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,406
Can you help me?

136
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,186
My dear friend.

137
00:09:28,086 --> 00:09:29,066
Your Majesty?

138
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:30,566
Is he…

139
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:32,666
the former emperor of the Byandy Empire,

140
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:35,246
Vlamrodiya Bayatilaz?

141
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:37,146
Why?

142
00:09:37,366 --> 00:09:40,906
The records state that the Corpse God is
the traitor who murdered the emperor,

143
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:43,026
but why would he be here?

144
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:44,986
Why did they sign the contract?

145
00:09:46,846 --> 00:09:48,446
I should've mentioned it before.

146
00:09:48,846 --> 00:09:51,886
No matter what you become,

147
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:55,146
I and Empire will be your partners.

148
00:09:56,006 --> 00:09:57,666
Necromancer.

149
00:09:58,446 --> 00:10:02,246
Did you preserve the entire fallen empire?

150
00:10:03,766 --> 00:10:09,686
Don't underestimate Corpse God,
he is my court wizard after all.

151
00:10:14,362 --> 00:10:17,122
But there are very few magic elements.

152
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:20,122
Refining magic seems to take a while.

153
00:10:20,382 --> 00:10:23,342
Then let me try to buy some time.

154
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:27,842
I'll use magic wire
to protect the towers of the city.

155
00:10:27,942 --> 00:10:31,842
I guess I'll have to
deal with something else.

156
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:33,222
Thank you.

157
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:39,522
It's been like a dream today.

158
00:10:40,502 --> 00:10:42,402
Dada Dada…

159
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,902
I have to admit it.

160
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:47,802
It is a power
that does not exist in this world.

161
00:10:48,002 --> 00:10:52,062
But the strange feeling that began
just now could not be ignored.

162
00:10:52,362 --> 00:10:54,762
Fire-breathing Bug, what do you think?

163
00:10:55,782 --> 00:10:58,062
BE CAREFUL OF THE FIRE
Dangerous, it should be burnt.

164
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:00,662
Before it causes an accident,

165
00:11:01,262 --> 00:11:03,182
BE CAREFUL OF THE FIRE
before it became a tragedy,

166
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:08,222
it should be burnt down with the city.

167
00:11:09,662 --> 00:11:12,442
Could you wait a moment, please?

168
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16,622
Miss, you are…

169
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:19,962
Whether he's a danger to the world,

170
00:11:20,522 --> 00:11:22,302
why don't you observe first?

171
00:11:23,022 --> 00:11:24,582
On what basis

172
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,962
and for what reason,

173
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:29,202
you want to stop us.

174
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,502
This concerns me.

175
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:36,262
I've been burnt by someone's fire,

176
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:42,702
which are the false bugs
that are obsessed with you.

177
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:45,982
And he has done me a favor.

178
00:11:46,742 --> 00:11:49,462
Did that strange feeling

179
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:52,402
have anything to do with her presence?

180
00:11:53,162 --> 00:11:55,562
So what do we do, Fire-breathing Bug?

181
00:11:58,762 --> 00:12:02,462
Maybe you do have a right to revenge.

182
00:12:03,342 --> 00:12:04,342
Leader?

183
00:12:06,262 --> 00:12:10,382
But it's our job to protect this city.

184
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:16,142
Are you saying that the people
of Sabaramond are part of the city?

185
00:12:16,442 --> 00:12:20,502
I'm talking about the ordinary citizens
you're currently possessing.

186
00:12:20,962 --> 00:12:23,622
If you complete your revenge,

187
00:12:23,862 --> 00:12:26,442
the fact that they killed people
will remain.

188
00:12:27,022 --> 00:12:28,642
And at that moment,

189
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:32,222
aren't you distorting their lives
by letting them stand here?

190
00:12:33,282 --> 00:12:36,042
I will let you finish your revenge
in some other way.

191
00:12:36,662 --> 00:12:40,242
At least those Sabaramond in Japan

192
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:41,782
will be destroyed by me.

193
00:12:42,382 --> 00:12:45,822
So you have to let those
innocent people go.

194
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:50,942
Do you want us to trust you and walk away?

195
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:52,542
That's not what I mean.

196
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:56,202
Since you want to
witness revenge so badly,

197
00:12:57,262 --> 00:13:00,302
then transfer your consciousness to me.

198
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:07,962
Why would you do that?

199
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:10,842
Why?

200
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:15,102
It's neither atonement nor repayment.

201
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,302
I know but I can't express it.

202
00:13:21,642 --> 00:13:26,602
If I give up like this, it seems that
my meeting with Polka will be in vain.

203
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:30,542
So I will try my best.

204
00:13:37,462 --> 00:13:41,262
I'll do whatever it takes
to get that shark doll back.

205
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:43,762
Wow.

206
00:13:43,962 --> 00:13:46,462
Are you a vampire?

207
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,222
You saw it? Wow!

208
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:56,902
What?

209
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:06,102
It never ends. What's the matter with you?

210
00:14:06,462 --> 00:14:09,342
Are you one of the Lemmings?

211
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:15,622
Then I'll just have to use
a little more power to deal with you.

212
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:21,642
I can't believe this kid doesn't
fear me being this form.

213
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:25,222
Unfortunately, I've already
met guys just like you.

214
00:14:25,362 --> 00:14:27,502
Movements, breathing,

215
00:14:28,002 --> 00:14:29,082
and soul.

216
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:38,042
I used that power to my best advantage.

217
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:39,922
Earthquake?

218
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:41,542
This is…

219
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,322
Is the elf about to make a move?

220
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:46,702
But I can only leave it to them now.

221
00:14:46,902 --> 00:14:47,962
What's more important…

222
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:53,582
The formation of the magic circle.

223
00:14:53,902 --> 00:14:57,122
With each touch, I can feel that he's
getting closer to the deeper mystery.

224
00:14:57,342 --> 00:14:59,822
He's just a layman, how arrogant he is.

225
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:02,762
Is he really a genius?

226
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:04,582
Even so,

227
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:08,262
how can he stand up after being attacked
by a magic of the level of court wizard?

228
00:15:08,702 --> 00:15:12,902
I don't think he's even
a wizard in this world.

229
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:18,062
Even though I felt that way
when I met him.

230
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:22,402
But it would be like facing Mr. Arius.

231
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:27,322
Although I don't want to fight
for anyone other than my Master,

232
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,542
if that's what the Master wants,

233
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:32,662
I work for the Shinoyama.

234
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:37,002
So you don't need to worry about
what's going on around you, just as usual.

235
00:15:37,282 --> 00:15:39,762
Just as usual,
don't notice my ugly jealousy

236
00:15:40,342 --> 00:15:44,062
and live a life of laughter
with the Master.

237
00:15:44,982 --> 00:15:48,042
Rather than saying
it's about taking back Polka,

238
00:15:48,202 --> 00:15:50,902
it's more like an attack on me.

239
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:54,442
So it's better if Polka
stays away from me.

240
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:55,522
Miss Sakimiya.

241
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:57,782
Xiaoyu.

242
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,022
I leave the real Polka to you.

243
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,162
Miss Sakimiya.

244
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,042
So impressive.

245
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:19,362
In the past, I could only control
my own body.

246
00:16:19,542 --> 00:16:21,682
I can't believe I can even do this now.

247
00:16:27,562 --> 00:16:28,842
Am I rescued?

248
00:16:30,342 --> 00:16:33,362
Is someone meddling?

249
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:35,882
Am I falling down?

250
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:42,462
It's the Lord Elf who's
being overly vigilant.

251
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:46,522
I never thought that monster
would come into the world.

252
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,782
W-Who are you?

253
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:54,282
Oh my.

254
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:59,862
It's only been 100 years since I was killed,
and even the language of Elf is extinct.

255
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:02,022
How shameful.

256
00:17:02,502 --> 00:17:03,482
Fine.

257
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:07,842
Even so, I didn't put my soul
to Corpse God in vain.

258
00:17:08,222 --> 00:17:11,502
After all, I can see the faces
of my children and grandchildren.

259
00:17:14,782 --> 00:17:17,662
The boy had the hand of a dragon.

260
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,942
If I had known this, I wouldn't
have cut off its prosthetic limb

261
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:24,422
He seems to be out of danger.

262
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,022
After that battle,

263
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:30,362
I appreciate you telling me
about the crisis my brother is facing.

264
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:33,382
So I will keep my covenant

265
00:17:34,242 --> 00:17:35,762
to cease fire with you

266
00:17:36,162 --> 00:17:39,462
until Xiaoyu chooses his own path.

267
00:17:41,662 --> 00:17:45,082
I can't believe it could
suppress the power of the elf.

268
00:17:49,682 --> 00:17:51,742
I'm just getting used to it.

269
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,122
It's amazing how far
you've gotten on your own.

270
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:58,982
But I don't want to lose to you like this.

271
00:17:59,462 --> 00:18:02,722
I'll give it my all until the end.

272
00:18:02,902 --> 00:18:04,062
That is…

273
00:18:04,942 --> 00:18:07,122
This is not just like it.

274
00:18:07,382 --> 00:18:10,282
Isn't that the magic circle
that Mr. Arius uses?

275
00:18:11,742 --> 00:18:14,862
Oh no. The whole city will be blown away.

276
00:18:15,842 --> 00:18:17,582
You haven't lost yet.

277
00:18:17,862 --> 00:18:21,182
In terms of strength alone,
you're much stronger.

278
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:23,982
I have just borrowed power.

279
00:18:24,422 --> 00:18:26,722
No, I have driven power,

280
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:29,082
driving everyone like props.

281
00:18:30,022 --> 00:18:31,422
That's good.

282
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:35,582
I and the others are dead people,
relics of the past.

283
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:38,782
Just use us as props
and keep moving forward.

284
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:42,882
Because you're still alive.

285
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:46,682
I'm already dead over there.

286
00:18:47,222 --> 00:18:49,702
What's here right now is just a corpse.

287
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:52,922
Being alive is not about a corpse,

288
00:18:53,702 --> 00:18:55,982
but about being able
to face life positively.

289
00:18:56,162 --> 00:18:57,342
Corpse God.

290
00:18:57,962 --> 00:18:59,942
No, Riz.

291
00:19:01,442 --> 00:19:04,222
This time you must protect
what needs to be protected in this world

292
00:19:04,702 --> 00:19:07,042
by your own will.

293
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:11,602
You're not like me.
You always move forward.

294
00:19:12,342 --> 00:19:15,542
Why are you always so positive?

295
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,922
I didn't know it then,

296
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:21,002
but now I understand more or less.

297
00:19:23,802 --> 00:19:26,862
This time I'm going to drag you into this.

298
00:19:28,922 --> 00:19:30,822
Let me pave the way for you.

299
00:19:31,742 --> 00:19:34,262
What a beautiful magic circle.

300
00:19:35,062 --> 00:19:37,222
It was that time,

301
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:40,702
the way I felt
when I first saw magic books.

302
00:19:47,622 --> 00:19:48,902
Looks like that's it.

303
00:19:49,902 --> 00:19:52,362
But I am very happy.

304
00:19:57,782 --> 00:20:01,662
Since you want to
witness revenge so badly,

305
00:20:01,882 --> 00:20:04,682
then transfer your consciousness to me.

306
00:20:04,782 --> 00:20:05,782
Mr. Iwa.

307
00:20:06,202 --> 00:20:09,382
Don't tell me
you're going to do this for me.

308
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:12,082
This is my judgment.

309
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:15,322
- Sorry.
- What?

310
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:18,102
Wow.

311
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:23,182
I stopped you when you were acting out
as we agreed.

312
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,122
At least show some mercy.

313
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:26,282
I did show mercy.

314
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:28,302
Mr. Iwa.

315
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:31,062
You're acting out about
Mr. Hosorogi again, right?

316
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:33,542
Please do not forget.

317
00:20:34,262 --> 00:20:35,762
For us,

318
00:20:35,922 --> 00:20:39,102
you are also a part of the city
that we need to protect.

319
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:41,162
I'm sorry.

320
00:20:41,882 --> 00:20:45,782
We understand your enlightenment.

321
00:20:46,402 --> 00:20:50,162
Whether that boy has bugs or not,

322
00:20:50,522 --> 00:20:54,942
we still need to observe.

323
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:56,442
That boy?

324
00:20:57,002 --> 00:21:02,982
It's up to you to decide
if he's going to disappear.

325
00:21:03,782 --> 00:21:06,062
What? Where is this? What?

326
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:08,662
BE CAREFUL OF THE FIRE
Why am I here?

327
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,762
It's Solitaire. Seriously?
Please give me an autograph.

328
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:16,742
Of course. Don't be fooled by my looking,
I'm actually a celebrity.

329
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:20,042
And you, that ghost-like lady…

330
00:21:20,662 --> 00:21:21,782
What?

331
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:28,682
Is it a dream?

332
00:21:29,082 --> 00:21:32,962
I remember what those guys
at the institute said,

333
00:21:33,082 --> 00:21:35,362
the heart-like thing transplanted into me

334
00:21:35,562 --> 00:21:39,362
is the core of a two-headed tiger monster.

335
00:21:40,402 --> 00:21:41,842
So itchy.

336
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:45,302
Am I still alive?

337
00:21:45,682 --> 00:21:47,262
Although you have been seriously injured,

338
00:21:47,462 --> 00:21:49,602
you are not dead.

339
00:21:50,562 --> 00:21:52,922
I turned part of you into a corpse,

340
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:55,302
which will slowly
transform into a living body.

341
00:21:56,182 --> 00:21:57,902
Why did you save me?

342
00:21:58,682 --> 00:22:00,502
You are a necromancer, aren't you?

343
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:04,262
Wouldn't it be better
to kill me and then use me?

344
00:22:04,762 --> 00:22:08,402
I'm just giving you
back the magic you gave me.

345
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:11,082
This is what I gave you…

346
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:13,522
- Moreover…
- Lord Civil.

347
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:16,662
I didn't hear anything
over the loud noise,

348
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:18,762
neither did I see anything.

349
00:22:19,682 --> 00:22:21,142
But at that moment,

350
00:22:21,582 --> 00:22:25,062
I just don't want to see the kid sad.

351
00:22:25,882 --> 00:22:29,602
I don't like taking something
away from a kid.

352
00:22:30,142 --> 00:22:32,222
You might regret it.

353
00:22:32,382 --> 00:22:33,362
Perhaps.

354
00:22:33,782 --> 00:22:35,102
But by then,

355
00:22:35,682 --> 00:22:38,202
I'll do everything I can to
protect everyone from the start.

356
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:41,762
I get it.

357
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:45,822
I've given up on returning
to the original world for now.

358
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:50,202
Because I realize that
this world is also worth living in.

359
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,822
Polka.

360
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:56,182
Lord Civil.

361
00:22:56,422 --> 00:22:59,422
I agree with that.

362
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:16,322
TRACKING REPORT

363
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:18,922
SNIPING OCCURRED, TARGET WAS POLKA SHINOYAMA, NO EXTERNAL INJURIES
Those who want to kill Polka Shinoyama

364
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:23,122
seem to be connected to the intermediary agency
in Ikebukuro or Roppongi.

365
00:23:24,242 --> 00:23:26,582
Don't forget, Corpse God.

366
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:29,142
So does Polka.

367
00:23:30,082 --> 00:23:33,442
Before you get the peace you want,

368
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:37,442
there are many challenges waiting for you.
