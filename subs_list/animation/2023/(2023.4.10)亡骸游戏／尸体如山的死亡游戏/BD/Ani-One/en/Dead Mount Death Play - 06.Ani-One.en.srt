00:00:00,608 --> 00:00:02,688
SHINOYAMA

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,740
It's bigger than Imperial
nobles' mansions.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,720
Oh my.

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,620
Uncle Polka, welcome back.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,560
(POLKA'S NEPHEW, SHIZUKI SHINOYAMA, 11 YEARS OLD)
I bet you were going to run away directly.

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,780
(POLKA'S NIECE, KAZUKI SHINOYAMA, 11 YEARS OLD)
I bet you were going to run away directly.

7
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,940
Uh-huh.

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,760
Because I had promised someone.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,740
Oh my, oh my.

10
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,340
I never expected you

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,620
to shamelessly come back.

12
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,500
(POLKA'S NEPHEW, SHINOYAMA SECURITY PRESIDENT)
(TAKERU SHINOYAMA, 26 YEARS OLD)

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,960
Weren't you on a journey to find yourself?

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,580
I found a brand new self in Shinjuku.

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,200
Anyway,

16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,340
who is the young lady next to you?

17
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,780
She is…

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,960
Nice to meet you.

19
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,020
I'm Misaki Sakimiya.

20
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,520
It's a pleasure to meet you.

21
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,810
(Dead Mount, Death Play)

22
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,680
Unexpectedly, you actually gave up

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,500
the idea of suicide because of Polka.

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,160
Yes.

25
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,520
If it weren't for polka,

26
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,640
I might not be alive today.

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,540
Since then,

28
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,860
Polka has numerous times saved me.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,740
It seems that he truly
"found a brand new self".

30
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,290
However,

31
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,020
I never expected that the young lady

32
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,740
from Sakimiya Steel
would actually be with you.

33
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,540
Sakimiya Steel no longer exists.

34
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,820
I misspoke.

35
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,900
I was fortunate to have received a lot
of care from your parents in the past,

36
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,380
and it's regrettable that

37
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,460
they had to go through
such a terrible thing.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,060
Rozan is the head of the Shinoyama family.

39
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,680
His eldest son, Gaku Shinoyama,
is 48 years old.

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,500
Rozan's second wife later
gave birth to Polka you,

41
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:16,920
the second son 30 years
younger than his elder son.

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,940
And your nephew, Takeru Shinoyama.

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,200
Among the relatives in Polka,

44
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,040
he is considered a very scary person.

45
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,280
He is the president of Shinoyama Security.

46
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,410
SHINOYAMA SECURITY? MOST OF THE PEOPLE
THERE ARE REHIRED POLICE OFFICERS

47
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,420
WHOSE MAIN JOB IS TO ELIMINATE SCANDALS
AND CLEAR OUT TROUBLEMAKERS.

48
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,570
IT IS SAID THAT THE SHINOYAMA GROUP
HAS AN ASSASSINATION TEAM

49
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,130
CONTROLLED BY TAKERU SHINOYAMA.

50
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,460
You know it very well.

51
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,680
The reason why he's considered scary

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,800
is mainly that he took charge of
such an organization

53
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,060
at the young age of 26.

54
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,120
You must have had a tough time.

55
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,500
If you encounter any difficulties,

56
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,700
feel free to come to us for help.

57
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,820
Kiri,

58
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,540
don't make promises about other
people's lives at will.

59
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,690
Oh.

60
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,760
What's wrong with this, Takeru?

61
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,560
(TAKERU'S WIFE, KIRI SHINOYAMA, 24 YEARS OLD)
Isn't it great that it feels like

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,630
(TAKERU'S WIFE, KIRI SHINOYAMA, 24 YEARS OLD)
we have gained a new family member?

63
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,760
I am reminding you

64
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,760
not to ignore the other party's thoughts
and say whatever you like.

65
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,520
Anyway, you are a friend of my family,

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,900
so I naturally welcome you.

67
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,160
You don't have to be restrained
and can be more casual.

68
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,660
Your kindness leaves me
humbled and grateful.

69
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,440
She's amazing.
Her response was impeccable.

70
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,940
I also need to work hard to
not reveal anything.

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,440
It took me a whole night to
remember the dining etiquette.

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,560
What's the deal with that shark plush toy?

73
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,640
It seems like it moves from time to time.

74
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,460
Hmm… This is…

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,900
Berg, the shark of hell.

76
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,020
Sis Sayo.

77
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,380
That design was

78
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,616
(POLKA'S NIECE, UNEMPLOYED, SAYO SHINOYAMA, 20 YEARS OLD)
the climax version

79
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:36,720
(POLKA'S NIECE, UNEMPLOYED, SAYO SHINOYAMA, 20 YEARS OLD)
of the second part,

80
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,320
and it can be considered
a masterpiece until the third one.

81
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:42,040
However, now that Shark Berg has
evolved into a completely humanoid form,

82
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,740
the shark-like appearance is gone.
Physiologically, I can't accept it.

83
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,740
Nevertheless, I personally think
that the artificial shark girl

84
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,920
who appeared in the fifth part is not bad.

85
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,140
But in the end, Shark Berg…

86
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,800
But speaking of which, fortunately,
young master Polka is safe and sound.

87
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,740
Oh? Yeah, that's right.

88
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,060
Who is he?

89
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,780
Is he my relative?

90
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
What's his name?

91
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,320
(RELATIVE, NEPHEW-IN-LAW OF ROZAN SHINOYAMA, 52 YEARS OLD)
It seems that you are

92
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,200
(RELATIVE, NEPHEW-IN-LAW OF ROZAN SHINOYAMA, 52 YEARS OLD)
even more energetic than your father.

93
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,700
May I ask, where are the others?

94
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,880
They are all working, of course.

95
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,680
Father and Mother are both abroad.

96
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,310
The only ones staying here today are

97
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,100
Bro Takeru who happened to be on day off,

98
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,400
Sis Kiri

99
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,580
and Sis Sayo who is not working.

100
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,360
I am the "guardian of my own room",

101
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,020
unable to take care of the whole family.

102
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,820
And then there are kids like us.

103
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,520
Hey, Kazuki.

104
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,020
How could you forget about me,
the head of the family?

105
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,992
(SHINOYAMA GROUP'S LEADER, ROZAN SHINOYAMA, 79 YEARS OLD)
I, as your Grandpa, will cry,

106
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:41,980
(SHINOYAMA GROUP'S LEADER, ROZAN SHINOYAMA, 79 YEARS OLD)
you know?

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,900
Grandpa,

108
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,680
are you able to walk?

109
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,440
Hmm, I'm feeling pretty good today.

110
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,520
By the way, Sayo.

111
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,440
What's up?

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,760
That movie you recommended before,

113
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,520
"The Shallows,"

114
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,340
was quite interesting.

115
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Really?

116
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,920
That's good.

117
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,640
Next time you can try
"47 Meters Down" or "Bait".

118
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,900
All of them are movies related to sharks.

119
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,880
President,

120
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,520
it's great to hear that
your health is gradually improving.

121
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,940
You came at the right time

122
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:15,200
I wanted to talk about the
pharmaceutical department with you.

123
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,920
As I am currently in a semi-retired state,

124
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,400
you can approach Gaku for
further discussions on this matter.

125
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,600
Yes, but…

126
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,670
Hey,

127
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,500
do you want me to say it again?

128
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,660
I'm…I'm really sorry.

129
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,080
Grandpa.

130
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,140
Don't make that kind of expression.

131
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,780
If it's an emergency,

132
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,540
I will listen to him in person.

133
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,160
So, Polka…

134
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,120
Yes…

135
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,960
You must have something to say.

136
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,060
Um… I'm really sorry for leaving home

137
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,640
without saying goodbye.

138
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,660
Not this, stupid.

139
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,780
You should say, "I'm back".

140
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,580
I'm back.

141
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,740
Regarding the matter of that young lady,

142
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,300
I overheard everything just now.

143
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,260
However, I would like to hear it
directly from you, Polka.

144
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,400
Let's go to the nearby tatami room.

145
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,820
Okay…

146
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,580
I'm sorry, miss.

147
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,110
You can wander around in the courtyard

148
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,360
as you please.

149
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,540
Okay.

150
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,760
Why didn't Grandpa show more anger

151
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,400
towards Polka's behavior?

152
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,700
He will get angry soon.

153
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,480
Fire… Fire…

154
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,020
It's going to catch fire.

155
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,280
Are you practicing as a diviner?

156
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,560
I see.

157
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,180
That young lady's distant relative runs
a high-end club in Shinjuku.

158
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,380
Yes.

159
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,660
Her relative lent me
an unused building room.

160
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,140
Such a generous person.

161
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,560
Anything else strange?

162
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,600
Something like a friend's drone
being caught by the police?

163
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,800
What is that all about?

164
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,160
Great,

165
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,800
it seems like I have managed to fool him.

166
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
By the way,

167
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,420
there's something else
I want to ask you about.

168
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,400
What is it, Father?

169
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,220
Who are you?

170
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,440
What are you talking about, Father?

171
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,980
Oh my, this is really incredible.

172
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,900
That face and voice are indeed Polka's.

173
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,920
In that case…

174
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,880
But you're not him.

175
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,500
You're not Polka.

176
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,620
I don't understand your words, Father.

177
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,260
This doesn't make sense.

178
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:43,820
Let me remind you

179
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,860
not to underestimate me.

180
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,960
Although I am close to death,

181
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,920
I am still a person who crawled out of
a pile of dead bodies.

182
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,840
And as a father,

183
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,040
do I need to have reasons?

184
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,220
I see.

185
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,480
Is this what parents are really like?

186
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,960
He is my beloved son.

187
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,920
Can't you give more money?

188
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,500
Completely different from

189
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,340
what I know as "parents".

190
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,000
You…

191
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,200
I have one more thing to ask you.

192
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,680
Where is the real Polka?

193
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,560
Is he still alive?

194
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,240
About this…

195
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,240
What are you doing?

196
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,060
Kazuki and Shizuki might be in danger.

197
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,360
What?

198
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
I have promised someone that

199
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,640
I will protect those two children,

200
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,300
so I have to go there now.

201
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,920
I will explain everything to you later.
Please trust me.

202
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,660
Although I couldn't understand
what you were saying,

203
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,140
but just go.

204
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,280
Thank you.

205
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,320
That's not something
an ordinary person can do.

206
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,640
Why not just kill him,

207
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,040
my lord?

208
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,560
I am not ruthless enough to be able

209
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,960
to kill someone who looks
exactly like my son.

210
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,770
This is no joke.

211
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,720
Sis Suzuka.

212
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,760
Um…

213
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,860
We were exploring in the backyard.

214
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,600
But my bag disappeared

215
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,700
and I don't know where it is.

216
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Don't worry.

217
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,680
I will go find it.

218
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,020
Really?

219
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,120
Thank you.

220
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,760
I found it.

221
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,160
Isn't this the bag I gave her before?

222
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,320
She really treasures it.

223
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,520
You actually managed to sneak in here.

224
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Who are you?

225
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,880
What did you do with
the original owner of that face?

226
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,520
I burned him.

227
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,740
Even his bones were turned into ashes.

228
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,080
I… I see.

229
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,940
I spent two years preparing for this.

230
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,720
It took quite a long time.

231
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,820
If I wanted to make it look like
an accident and burn a few people,

232
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,140
it would be much simpler.

233
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,660
For example,

234
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,640
I could make it look like the fire was
caused by those twins playing with fire.

235
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,840
What's wrong?

236
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,760
Nothing.

237
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,320
Not bad.

238
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,320
It has a great taste

239
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,900
that makes me want to burn

240
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,620
the tender body immediately.

241
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,000
I need to hurry and notify them.

242
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,480
I should notify Grandpa and Bro Takeru,

243
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,660
Kazuki and Shizuki.

244
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,900
What's going on? It's so hot.

245
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,620
The boiler room exploded?

246
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,940
Hey! Where is Miss Suzuka?

247
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,340
Oh, great!

248
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,020
You two are safe and sound.

249
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,340
Hurry up and escape!

250
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,660
Why aren't you moving?

251
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,820
Can't you hear my voice?

252
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
Who can…

253
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,360
Who can come and save…

254
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,880
Who can come and save…

255
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,460
these two children?

256
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,840
What's that sound?

257
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,680
Are you two okay?

258
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,820
Miss Kazuki, Master Shizuki, it's on fire!

259
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,060
On fire?

260
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,340
Quickly come with me to this side!

261
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,490
Don't…follow him!

262
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,580
(TOKYO DETENTION CENTER)
Mr. Iwa,

263
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,330
that guy is a calamity.

264
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,100
Why do we still need to interrogate him?

265
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,020
We need to break the routine

266
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,080
a little bit in this case.

267
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,040
A little?

268
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,660
I understand it all.

269
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,440
But this guy

270
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,140
is undoubtedly the person

271
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,820
closest to "that thing" we've seen.

272
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,880
Tena Sorimura.

273
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,960
No, I should call you Phantom Solitaire.

274
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,640
The nickname you gave me

275
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,320
comes from my real name.

276
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,760
I've gotten used to it recently.

277
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,680
That's great.

278
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,260
I see. I'm interested in it.

279
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,860
Although it is unclear whether
it was accidental or intentional,

280
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,720
the cause of the fire
has been determined to be

281
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,500
from the calamity, the Firestarter.

282
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,600
That guy usually leaves behind
eerie crime statements at the scene,

283
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,920
"This world is a buggy program",

284
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,040
which also appeared

285
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,220
without exception at the site of the fire.

286
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,740
And without exception,

287
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,080
the fire will spread astonishingly quickly

288
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,900
in every one of the locations
that he has targeted.

289
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,100
So I made a hypothesis that

290
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,740
the guy disguised himself
as relevant personnel

291
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,000
and spent a long time
setting up the crime tools bit by bit,

292
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,360
just like insects hide their bodies

293
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,040
while eating away at houses.

294
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,200
As a result, flames
will suddenly burst out.

295
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,300
Come over here!

296
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,340
There is a shelter passage
leading to the outside here.

297
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,560
Hmm.

298
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,240
Kazuki, why did you stop?

299
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,820
Let's hurry up and go over there.

300
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,940
No, there shouldn't be any

301
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,880
shelter passages underground here.

302
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,360
No,

303
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,600
it has always been there, young lady.

304
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,560
It took me two years to build.

305
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,090
I finally caught up.

306
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,560
Although I can't see you,

307
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,160
please rest assured that

308
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,540
Polka and I will protect
these two children.

309
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,400
Wow, you're quite sturdy.

310
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,620
It's because this skin is very thick.

311
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,260
Originally, I only planned to
taste these twins today,

312
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,060
but unexpectedly, a big meal was
delivered right to my front door.

313
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,780
It seems that Polka was right after all.

314
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,680
Monitoring you was absolutely correct.

315
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,500
Okay, hurry up and escape to the top.

316
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,380
B-But…

317
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,830
Hurry.

318
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,100
Let's go.

319
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,860
Mister,

320
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,960
we are the same kind of people, right?

321
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,320
You should know me, right?

322
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,840
The Assassin Hunter, Zaki.

323
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,980
I've seen you before
when I was scouting out

324
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,860
at Clarissa's shop.

325
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,000
It turns out I was right.

326
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,100
You were wary of me when we had a conflict

327
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,540
in the building where Polka stayed.

328
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,780
So I was exposed because of this.

329
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,860
But why are you

330
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,660
with Polka Shinoyama?

331
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,790
Did Rozan hire you?

332
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,980
It's a little different.

333
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,840
I'm not telling you.

334
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,220
Idiot.

335
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,900
Are you human?

336
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,140
Speaking of which, I thought

337
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,780
you would definitely go
after those two kids.

338
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,220
But why didn't I do that?

339
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,000
That's because

340
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,320
they couldn't escape anymore.

341
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,060
You will be buried in the fire
with those two little brats.

342
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,700
Lower your body a bit.

343
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,520
Maybe this is retribution.

344
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,010
Sis Suzuka

345
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,950
must be angry.

346
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,870
No way.

347
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,680
Is it really like that?

348
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,580
After all, her death was our fault.

349
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,640
Sister is angry, right?

350
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,470
If we can see sister,

351
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,430
let's apologize to her together, Shizuki.

352
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,790
Hmm.

353
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,300
Sis Suzuka?

354
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,010
Great,

355
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,390
I made it this time.

356
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,200
Polka?

357
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,110
Didn't the diviner tell you before?

358
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,680
You still have a future.

359
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,560
Besides,

360
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,880
she's not angry with you.

361
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,420
Miss Suzuka

362
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,190
has been caring about you all along.

363
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,280
Where is the fire truck?

364
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,720
They said it would be here soon!

365
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,320
Miss Kazuki! Young master Shizuki!

366
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,950
Thank goodness you are both safe.

367
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:02,160
Alright, now it's time for us

368
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,880
to clean up and deal with the aftermath

369
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,980
of this senseless disaster.

370
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,260
The Firestarter should have finished
his business by now.

371
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,570
That stubborn old man, Rozan

372
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,890
dared to make me lose face
in front of everyone.

373
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,340
Then you can cry while smelling the burnt

374
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,370
smell of your own offspring.

375
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,400
This is impossible.

376
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,170
I have arranged everything perfectly.

377
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,960
After I left, everything would be burnt.

378
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,160
Where are you going?

379
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,010
Young master Polka.

380
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,450
You're safe.

381
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,800
There's no need to deceive me.

382
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,580
Your soul's color hasn't changed.

383
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,210
And yesterday,

384
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,850
my attention was all on
that pair of twins, so I didn't notice it.

385
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,310
It seems like there are
a lot of people who hate you.

386
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,400
Give it back…

387
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,550
My face…

388
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,580
Your voice has turned back
to that of a man.

389
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,560
That was really close just now.

390
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,910
I thought I was going to die
from lack of oxygen.

391
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,710
My cross-dressing was
actually exposed twice.

392
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,970
Stop being so stubborn.

393
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,160
If I had enough magic,

394
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,240
I would spend a hundred years
torturing you to death.

395
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,840
It's so scary.

396
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,620
You're just pretending.

397
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,890
You're like a middle school student
who has just awakened their superpowers.

398
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,710
You remind me of

399
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,800
when I first learned
how to control flames.

400
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,520
Fire is very scary, isn't it?

401
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:51,180
So you people
have nothing to be afraid of.

402
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,360
No matter who you are,

403
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,190
in the end, you will all
succumb to the flames.

404
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,900
I won't say goodbye to you all.

405
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,550
Bugs are very tenacious.

406
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,380
No matter how you try to eliminate them,
they will continue to emerge endlessly.

407
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,500
Can my remaining magic
break through this firewall?

408
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,440
There are two people
on the other side of the firewall?

409
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,380
This color is…

410
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,880
Lemmings.

411
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,720
Huh? Why is he here?

412
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,630
Does that mean he wants us
to keep it secret for him?

413
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,640
What's going on?

414
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,610
Ta-Takeru.

415
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,920
The arsonist who teamed up with you

416
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,280
is now being escorted back to
the police station by the police.

417
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,780
How is that possible? Ah no,

418
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,330
I know nothing about this matter.

419
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,650
Dra-Dragon King's Palace Agency.

420
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,240
I don't remember giving it

421
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,420
such an exaggerated title.

422
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,380
I just gathered together the people
responsible for doing dirty work

423
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,440
from various departments of
the Shinoyama Group.

424
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,590
W-Wait.

425
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,760
I was being threatened by the Firestarter.

426
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:08,970
I see.

427
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,940
Then there's no other way.

428
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,920
You have become so foolish.

429
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,840
No wonder you dared to
go against the entire family.

430
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,650
There was a lie in the intelligence

431
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,840
you just mentioned.

432
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,720
You seem to know it very well.

433
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,720
Someone who is good at disguises?

434
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,660
Spending a long time
setting up traps at home?

435
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,300
You're lying to me.

436
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,300
That's not right!

437
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,080
He's just a common criminal

438
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,120
who committed crimes out of pure malice.

439
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,260
He's not the calamity that you mentioned.

440
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,830
What can be called a calamity
are those who, as humans,

441
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,350
are able to do things far beyond human
capabilities without relying on magic.

442
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,960
No.

443
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,610
Or rather,

444
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,320
what they do is no different from magic.

445
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,280
Moreover,

446
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,360
The Firestarter must have left behind

447
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,260
a second-half text at the crime scene
that only the police knew about.

448
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,700
However,

449
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,550
the scenes you just mentioned

450
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:11,400
did not include the
second half of the text.

451
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,890
Am I right?

452
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,990
How did you find out about this matter?

453
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,880
Damn.

454
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,560
I'll find a chance to burn it all down,
including the car and the people here.

455
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,120
No… No way!

456
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,230
This world is a buggy program.

457
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,840
C-Could it be…

458
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,460
So it cries out for the flames.

459
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,520
Th-The real Firestarter.

460
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,820
Be, be, be, ho-ho-honest.

461
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:52,590
Fake, tra-trash. Garbage bug, lier, fake.

462
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,490
The fake one

463
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,330
must be eliminated.

464
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,300
It's so hot. What's going on?

465
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,690
Hot, hot!

466
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,400
What's going on?

467
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,300
Go outside the car quickly!

468
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,720
What exactly

469
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,080
happened?

470
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,970
That child was completely soaked through

471
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:20,190
and crying under the willow tree

472
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,460
in the drizzling rain.

473
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,790
