1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,920
Young man, you must remember this well.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,950
This is the emblem of the empire
where you will live in the future.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,470
That is…

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,976
Yes.

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,550
The emblem used by Father was too simple.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,820
So, when I ascended the throne,

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,850
I personally redesigned one.

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,980
Cool, right?

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,710
It was the emblem of a destroyed empire

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,570
I once lived in.

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,520
Why does it appear here?

12
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:41,826
THINGS ARE URGENT RIGHT NOW.

13
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,170
WHY WAS IT EXPOSED? WHY?

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,514
OUR COMPATRIOTS IN JAPAN HAVE BEEN ATTACKED BY THE FIRE-BREATHING BUG AGAIN.

15
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:48,032
YOU'RE STILL SO WELL-INFORMED.
THE MOST CRUCIAL THING NOW IS TO KEEP THIS MATTER FROM BEING MADE PUBLIC.

16
00:00:48,032 --> 00:00:48,930
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SUPPRESS THIS MATTER ANYMORE.

17
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,338
HIDE IT, HIDE IT, HIDE IT.
DIDN'T WE ALREADY DISGUISE IT AS THE WORK OF A VIOLENT GANG?

18
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:56,290
DON'T MAKE ANY RECKLESS MOVES, YOU FILTHY BUGS.
KILL SOLITAIRE, KILL HIM, KILL HIM, KILL HIM.

19
00:00:58,048 --> 00:00:59,600
KILL HIM IN ONE STRIKE, DON'T EVEN GIVE HIM TIME TO SUFFER.

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,026
MASSACRING COULD BRING US SOME VENGEANCE, BUT IT MIGHT ACCIDENTALLY EXPOSE US.

21
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:04,962
JUST LIKE THE INCIDENT FIVE YEARS AGO.

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,640
(Episode 10: The Emblem)

23
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:38,178
(Dead Mount, Death Play)

24
00:02:38,178 --> 00:02:39,748
What's going on?

25
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:42,068
Is that the sign mentioned earlier?

26
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,888
It seems there's no need
for me to hide it anymore.

27
00:02:50,548 --> 00:02:52,118
It's just slightly different in shape.

28
00:02:52,708 --> 00:02:54,178
DO NOT TRUST ANYONE. THE KEY IS BEHIND THE MIRROR AT NUMBER 383
Is this the pattern that Polka Shinoyama drew?

29
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:55,418
Yes.

30
00:02:56,098 --> 00:02:58,258
Since Solitaire directed this,

31
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,338
it means that he has
a connection with Mr. Hosorogi.

32
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:03,958
No, maybe he has a connection with the
group that Mr. Hosorogi was investigating.

33
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:06,328
Anyway, we have seen the same sign

34
00:03:06,328 --> 00:03:07,938
keep appearing.

35
00:03:08,808 --> 00:03:11,988
At this point, five years after
Prosecutor Hosorogi's disappearance,

36
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:14,218
it's better to think of it as
a sign of something

37
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:15,978
rather than a coincidence.

38
00:03:16,198 --> 00:03:17,048
Yes.

39
00:03:17,778 --> 00:03:19,658
Solitaire

40
00:03:19,728 --> 00:03:21,338
might be targeting me.

41
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,778
He might be hiding somewhere,

42
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:27,028
and he saw me getting
a divination from Polka Shinoyama.

43
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:29,958
It's not the time to focus on
making inferences right now.

44
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:31,508
Anyway, the information…

45
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:34,998
Ah, I finally found you!
Tsubaki-chan, Tsubaki-chan.

46
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:36,488
Ms. Yamada.

47
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:38,648
The situation seems to be getting worse.

48
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:40,058
Someone is looking for you, Tsubaki-chan.

49
00:03:40,258 --> 00:03:41,078
Looking for me?

50
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:42,918
Who is looking for me?

51
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:46,278
It's the headquarters
of the Metropolitan Police Department.

52
00:03:47,288 --> 00:03:48,648
Both the Tokyo Metropolitan Government
and the Metropolitan Police Department

53
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:51,238
said that the airships in this area now

54
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:52,818
do not have a flight permit.

55
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:56,298
-At this time, compared to the news,
-The possibility of this incident being related

56
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:58,628
-there is more information on the Internet.
-to the government or terrorist attacks is very low.

57
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:00,308
-But this time,
-There is a certain possibility that

58
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:01,498
-I really went all out,
-it's an event planned by an art company.

59
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,218
I even bought the whole airships.

60
00:04:07,618 --> 00:04:08,578
So,

61
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:11,578
can you tell me how much the information
I'm looking for costs me right now?

62
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:14,518
Three trillion yen.

63
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,466
Pardon?

64
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,558
It is worth three trillion yen.

65
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,898
There was a decimal before,

66
00:04:24,228 --> 00:04:26,328
but I'll leave it out this time.

67
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:28,118
Hold on, hold on.

68
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:30,868
Isn't this strange?

69
00:04:31,178 --> 00:04:34,548
You helped me with radio interference for
three minutes for 30 million yen, right?

70
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:36,868
As I said before,

71
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:41,298
I set prices according to
the money the customer has.

72
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:43,978
The money mentioned here

73
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:46,168
refers to the value of
the customer's life.

74
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:47,498
I don't understand.

75
00:04:47,798 --> 00:04:49,188
So why does it cost three trillion yen?

76
00:04:49,818 --> 00:04:51,338
According to my estimate,

77
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:55,258
if you do your best

78
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:57,768
and use various means to make money,

79
00:04:57,828 --> 00:05:00,088
you can earn six trillion yen
in your lifetime,

80
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:02,138
although this is just a rough estimate.

81
00:05:02,648 --> 00:05:04,788
It is worth to spend half of your life

82
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:06,868
to obtain the value of this sign.

83
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:10,088
Please don't misunderstand.

84
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:12,338
This price is only for you.

85
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:15,018
If someone else came to
buy this information,

86
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:18,138
I would sell it for dozens of yen.

87
00:05:20,228 --> 00:05:23,158
Because for others,
the true meaning of this sign

88
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:24,618
is just a leisure-time topic.

89
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,758
It is no different from

90
00:05:26,818 --> 00:05:28,818
a piece of gum chewed to pass the time.

91
00:05:29,378 --> 00:05:32,018
But you are different.

92
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:34,248
I guarantee you

93
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:37,288
that this information can be
a panacea that determines

94
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:40,118
your fate.

95
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:41,498
This is beyond doubt.

96
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:46,058
However, improper use will destroy you.

97
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:48,738
I don't think three trillion yen

98
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:52,468
is too much to pay for this prescription.

99
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,148
I see.

100
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:56,568
I'll accept it as it is the opinion

101
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:57,988
of someone who the
previous generation valued.

102
00:05:58,628 --> 00:06:00,338
But let's forget about the transaction.

103
00:06:00,698 --> 00:06:02,328
It's a wise decision.

104
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:04,648
Since we've come this far,

105
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:06,818
it's boring to just listen to
the answer you give me.

106
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:09,828
I'll try to find the answer on my own.

107
00:06:10,278 --> 00:06:13,778
But I still need to spend money
to ask you to do something for me.

108
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:18,058
I want to get a few airships.
How much will they cost?

109
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:23,208
Using people as ropes to control balloons

110
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:24,788
is something worth learning from.

111
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:33,428
Huh? Did I hit it?

112
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,308
It missed. You can tell by looking.

113
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,278
Is this considered a mission failure?

114
00:06:40,488 --> 00:06:42,928
I don't know, but it seems like
we can't get the reward.

115
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:46,578
We can't get any decent jobs

116
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:47,928
in Shibuya or Ikebukuro.

117
00:06:48,328 --> 00:06:49,498
Shall we go find jobs at Shinjuku?

118
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:51,938
The intermediary agency
there has a good reputation.

119
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:57,348
SHOCKING!! AN ENIGMATIC ORGANIZATION HIDING WITHIN SOCIETY!
My puppet was sniped 58 minutes

120
00:06:57,778 --> 00:07:00,728
after the airship took off.

121
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:03,238
How did they know

122
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:05,368
that I was on that airship?

123
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:08,148
Before this, only the police helicopter

124
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,878
could climb up to that position.

125
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:14,018
In other words, within less than an hour,
an organization capable of sniping at me

126
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:17,268
has already infiltrated the police.

127
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:20,168
Therefore, I am here
to challenge the audience.

128
00:07:20,738 --> 00:07:22,458
The moment I revealed this sign,

129
00:07:22,738 --> 00:07:24,698
someone wanted to assassinate me.

130
00:07:24,888 --> 00:07:27,588
It's not an exaggeration
to call those guys a secret organization.

131
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:29,928
Doesn't this sound good?

132
00:07:30,248 --> 00:07:33,028
There are such dangerous
things in the world.

133
00:07:33,398 --> 00:07:34,708
Ladies and gentlemen.

134
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:37,988
I am also very interested
in the emblem on the airships.

135
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:40,858
I need information related to the emblem,
such as people or places involved.

136
00:07:41,218 --> 00:07:43,498
I will choose a few people who provide
the most valuable information,

137
00:07:43,498 --> 00:07:46,578
and give them 300 million yen.

138
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:48,578
As for whether I will really
fulfill my promise,

139
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:52,468
people who know what I have done so far
should understand, right?

140
00:07:53,048 --> 00:07:54,938
I'll tell you how to contact me later.

141
00:07:55,318 --> 00:07:56,618
Goodbye.

142
00:07:57,498 --> 00:07:58,758
I forgot to say my farewell greetings.

143
00:07:58,758 --> 00:08:00,610
THE LIVE BROADCAST HAS ENDED

144
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:03,958
It seems to have turned
into a very bad situation.

145
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:06,038
Hmm, what should we do?

146
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:07,778
Let's think about it one by one.

147
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:10,468
What's the first thing to consider?

148
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:12,458
That naturally is… right?

149
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:13,818
Yes.

150
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:17,098
Exactly, I want to hear an explanation.

151
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,448
About empires and reincarnations.

152
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:27,338
Polka, you will explain it
to me clearly, right?

153
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:30,328
Yes.

154
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:34,976
CORPSE GOD

155
00:08:38,882 --> 00:08:40,592
CORPSE GOD
Here is a brief summary of the background.

156
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,302
Corpse God, that is, Polka Shinoyama,
is a reincarnated human being.

157
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:48,052
BYANDY EMPIRE
In his previous life, he was transformed into a court wizard.

158
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:50,322
Byandy Empire

159
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:54,072
is an armed country with
no ambition to dominate the world.

160
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:56,342
HERO SHAGRUA
A hundred years after the empire's collapse,

161
00:08:56,722 --> 00:08:59,332
the so-called Calamity Crusher,
the hero Shagrua,

162
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,802
defeated Corpse God.

163
00:09:02,482 --> 00:09:04,372
However, Corpse God cast a spell,

164
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:09,392
and was reincarnated into the body of
Polka Shinoyama in Shinjuku.

165
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:12,132
I HAVE TO WORK
He has struggled for a stable life

166
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:14,452
THE FOLLOWING IS OMITTED
and faced the uncertainty of the future.

167
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:16,672
That's how it is.

168
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:19,092
The soul of the real Polka is safe.

169
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:20,952
I will return his body to him later.

170
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,822
How could she believe such a statement?

171
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:27,542
It's easier not to believe it.

172
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:30,432
It seems you don't intend
to tell me the truth.

173
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:32,312
Enough, I'm angry.

174
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,512
I see.

175
00:09:35,832 --> 00:09:36,832
I believe what you said.

176
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:38,512
You believe it?

177
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:42,832
I can vaguely feel that you are not Polka.

178
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:44,712
When you were doing the divination,

179
00:09:44,982 --> 00:09:47,792
even when the police officer grabbed
your collar, you remained very calm.

180
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:49,272
Polka can't be so calm.

181
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:51,922
However, I'm still confused
about the situation.

182
00:09:52,882 --> 00:09:54,792
Polka was actually killed by someone,

183
00:09:54,872 --> 00:09:56,852
although I don't want to believe it.

184
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:59,302
I need to take a bath to calm down

185
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:01,862
before hearing your detailed explanation.

186
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:06,502
Xiaoyu went out shopping. I won't tell
him about this, so please rest assured.

187
00:10:10,182 --> 00:10:12,612
Her personality is extremely
difficult to understand.

188
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,602
Letting her see dancing bones
should be alright?

189
00:10:16,022 --> 00:10:18,532
I think she probably
won't spread it around.

190
00:10:19,122 --> 00:10:21,432
It's best to prepare for the worst.
Can you erase memories?

191
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:25,492
There is a necromancy that drives the soul
to possess the target's soul

192
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,162
and removes a part of the memory.

193
00:10:28,692 --> 00:10:29,792
It's using the soul as a scalpel

194
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:32,052
SOUL MEMORY
to remove a piece of the target's soul.

195
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:35,832
This approach may cause a chain reaction
in the physical brain.

196
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,352
This kind of necromancy and
the brainwashing or interrogation magic

197
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:41,392
used by Geldwood are not
part of the same system.

198
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:43,632
Is it a difficult magic?

199
00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:45,732
Honestly, it's not too difficult.

200
00:10:46,182 --> 00:10:48,832
But this is for people in my world.

201
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,482
If it is applied to people in this world,

202
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:55,092
a fatal mistake will turn
them into wrecks.

203
00:10:57,112 --> 00:10:58,952
It's not easy to try then.

204
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:01,732
If the target is clearly an enemy,

205
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:05,122
messing with them casually
to break their spirit might not be bad.

206
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:08,932
Did you

207
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:11,972
manipulate the memories of those thugs?

208
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:13,892
I was careful when I took action,

209
00:11:14,452 --> 00:11:16,342
in order to avoid turning them into
complete wrecks.

210
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,102
You can be quite frightening at times.

211
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:22,882
What's wrong?

212
00:11:23,732 --> 00:11:25,352
You said I'm only frightening "at times,"

213
00:11:25,622 --> 00:11:26,632
which makes me feel a little happy.

214
00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:29,492
Although I do feel a bit scared,

215
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:31,922
compared to Misaki you killed,
it's not much at all.

216
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:33,172
Uh, where is she?

217
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:35,172
Misaki?

218
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,406
THE SHARK CANNOT SEE

219
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:45,122
What do you want from me?

220
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,602
I want to talk to you.

221
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:49,272
Talk?

222
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:51,762
Aren't you curious about
what was just said?

223
00:11:53,492 --> 00:11:54,642
Who

224
00:11:56,022 --> 00:11:57,912
killed Polka?

225
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:01,842
Or you have already known,

226
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:04,402
so you don't care?

227
00:12:05,872 --> 00:12:08,272
Let's talk about sharks instead of this.

228
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:11,032
Don't change the subject.

229
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:15,392
If I say it was me who killed Polka,

230
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:17,922
what would you think?

231
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:21,522
Is that so?

232
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:23,412
I see.

233
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:27,912
You want someone to blame you, don't you?

234
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:31,702
Polka must have forgiven you.

235
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:34,192
After all, he is a kind child.

236
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:37,332
When he saw the man-eating shark
being killed at the end of the movie,

237
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,652
he would say he felt sorry

238
00:12:39,652 --> 00:12:42,022
for both the person and the shark.

239
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:45,912
I'll ask you more about
what exactly happened later on.

240
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,202
But,

241
00:12:47,552 --> 00:12:50,552
although Polka has forgiven you,

242
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:54,402
you still cannot accept
his forgiveness in your heart.

243
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,712
So, you want to alleviate
your guilt a little

244
00:12:58,072 --> 00:13:00,182
through my scolding.

245
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:02,112
What a cunning child.

246
00:13:02,952 --> 00:13:04,952
But it's okay. I forgive you.

247
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:07,672
I won't scold you.

248
00:13:17,712 --> 00:13:19,032
You saw right through me.

249
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:20,752
You're like a detective.

250
00:13:22,752 --> 00:13:23,942
Aren't you scared?

251
00:13:24,392 --> 00:13:27,972
I'm the killer who cut Polka's throat
and killed him.

252
00:13:28,852 --> 00:13:29,792
I'm not scared.

253
00:13:31,012 --> 00:13:32,102
Why?

254
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:35,012
People who like shark movies are kind.

255
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:39,492
Huh?

256
00:13:40,342 --> 00:13:42,032
Although I haven't spent
a lot of time with you,

257
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:44,832
talking about sharks and shark movies
with you is really enjoyable.

258
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:48,432
Someone who can talk to me about
sharks and shark movies

259
00:13:48,482 --> 00:13:50,292
couldn't be a bad person.

260
00:13:50,902 --> 00:13:52,752
Even if you cut off the heads of
my family members,

261
00:13:52,942 --> 00:13:54,792
sharks would forgive you.

262
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:56,866
I NEVER EXPECTED MY OWN FAMILY TO BE SO NONSENSICAL

263
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:58,338
IN THE FACE OF SUCH A REALITY, POLKA SHINOYAMA'S SOUL

264
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,874
CHOOSES TO ACT AS IF NOTHING HAS HAPPENED

265
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:01,376
THE SHARK DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING!

266
00:14:02,002 --> 00:14:02,992
By the way,

267
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,782
you saved Kazuki and Shizuki.

268
00:14:06,562 --> 00:14:07,622
Although it's not a big deal,

269
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,172
this is my second reason
for forgiving you.

270
00:14:15,472 --> 00:14:18,152
Really? Is it just incidental?

271
00:14:19,362 --> 00:14:21,232
Ah, it's so annoying.

272
00:14:21,992 --> 00:14:24,992
I don't know what to say.

273
00:14:27,942 --> 00:14:28,832
Then don't think about it.

274
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,592
Talk to me about sharks, will you?

275
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:35,012
So,

276
00:14:35,062 --> 00:14:37,202
SOFT, SMOOTH
I was originally going to test

277
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:39,522
whether Sayo was the one
who commissioned me to kill Polka.

278
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,152
But I failed.

279
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:42,802
However, I think

280
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:45,632
Sayo has nothing to do
with the assassination of Polka.

281
00:14:46,132 --> 00:14:48,612
Got it. What are you doing?

282
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:49,622
Are you an idiot?

283
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:51,512
From the conversation just now,

284
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:54,272
I can only figure out
that you are definitely crazy.

285
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:55,702
You're really rude.

286
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:58,822
I just keep thinking about sharks,
and I'm not interested in anything else.

287
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:01,622
So I wouldn't commission
someone to kill Polka.

288
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:03,842
Is there a connection between the two?

289
00:15:04,422 --> 00:15:05,252
I mean,

290
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:08,672
if I wanted to kill Polka, I would
definitely throw him to feed the sharks.

291
00:15:09,202 --> 00:15:11,272
It's surprisingly persuasive.
How annoying.

292
00:15:12,832 --> 00:15:14,872
Did you soak the doll in hot water?

293
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:17,042
I didn't do that.

294
00:15:17,762 --> 00:15:19,522
Sorry, I took the shark doll

295
00:15:19,892 --> 00:15:21,122
without your permission.

296
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:22,902
Living with someone like this

297
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:25,152
must not be easy for you.

298
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:27,232
I'm seeing it for the first time.

299
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:30,552
I hope all sharks and I can be a family.

300
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:32,582
By the way,

301
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:34,352
did you bring it in knowing whose it was?

302
00:15:35,192 --> 00:15:40,022
What are you talking about?

303
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:41,862
Although you didn't know,

304
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:44,452
because it witnessed you
getting changed, I feel sorry for you.

305
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:46,102
It doesn't matter at all.

306
00:15:46,482 --> 00:15:47,172
It doesn't matter?

307
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:49,462
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
I never thought my family would turn into a shark.

308
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:51,432
I thought there were two souls
fused together

309
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:54,072
inside your body.

310
00:15:54,582 --> 00:15:56,312
Mr. Rozan said the same thing.

311
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:57,762
I understand now.

312
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:59,752
I'll lend my body to Polka.

313
00:15:59,822 --> 00:16:01,792
Then you can turn me into a shark.

314
00:16:03,042 --> 00:16:04,582
Why?

315
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,760
I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE CONVERSATION ANYMORE
THE SHARK DARES NOT SPEAK

316
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,744
POLKA’S SOUL STOPS LOOKING INTO IT

317
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:09,602
Speaking of which,

318
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:11,682
how should we handle
this important issue, Polka?

319
00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:13,152
This is a very important sign

320
00:16:13,352 --> 00:16:15,492
for you, right?

321
00:16:16,102 --> 00:16:17,912
There's no problem with
making this sign public.

322
00:16:18,372 --> 00:16:21,992
But if there's a group of
people who plan to

323
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,112
do something using this sign,
I must go to meet them.

324
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:27,782
That sign is our precious memory.

325
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:31,252
But if it's tainted and
I still sit idly by,

326
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:33,712
I can no longer live peacefully.

327
00:16:36,032 --> 00:16:37,012
I got it.

328
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:40,632
Now the only thing
we can do is to investigate

329
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:42,840
whether there really is an organization
behind the scenes using that sign.

330
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,376
Moreover, this might also be
a trap set by Solitaire.

331
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,904
In other words,
that person named Solitaire

332
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:51,992
is a wizard from the same world as Polka?

333
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:52,936
No.

334
00:16:53,224 --> 00:16:55,496
He wants to get information
about that sign.

335
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,760
So,

336
00:16:57,112 --> 00:16:59,352
I don't think he's from my world.

337
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,224
Can't you use something like
analysis magic to determine it?

338
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:04,648
Analysis magic?

339
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,160
TITLE: GOOD YOUTH OF SHINJUKU TITLE: CORPSE GOD
Something that allows you to know the other person's

340
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:09,816
level, profession, or skills
just by looking at them.

341
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:12,216
Isn't that the same as the move

342
00:17:12,488 --> 00:17:14,744
Takumi used during divination?

343
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:18,296
Focusing on the customer's name
and casting a spell

344
00:17:18,808 --> 00:17:20,488
to obtain identity information!

345
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:23,864
SECURITY SYSTEM, IT DOESN'T WORK FOR OBJECTS WITH HIGHER LEVELS
Could I be considered an analysis magician?

346
00:17:24,648 --> 00:17:27,256
I know the secret art of reincarnation

347
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:30,120
because I spent years learning it.

348
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,400
I don't know if there are other people
who have come to this world.

349
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:37,304
But these bones were summoned
from your world, right?

350
00:17:38,456 --> 00:17:40,184
I was surprised to be able to summon them.

351
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:42,472
I simply used nearby objects

352
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,632
as temporary targets possessed.

353
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:46,840
What I summoned was only the soul.

354
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:50,600
Are there more articulate souls?

355
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:54,104
There are.

356
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,672
However,

357
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,688
I freed almost all souls before
the last church subjugation unit arrived.

358
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:03,912
Even so, there were still people who
continued to fulfill their contracts.

359
00:18:05,032 --> 00:18:07,472
But what kind of expression should
I have while summoning

360
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:09,572
as someone who was once
called a world calamity?

361
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:12,292
So, only memories…

362
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:14,612
Let's stop talking about gloomy things.

363
00:18:15,272 --> 00:18:16,792
When you want to summon,

364
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,232
just summon with a smile.

365
00:18:18,892 --> 00:18:20,752
If you upset the other person
or get beaten up,

366
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:22,512
just apologize to them sincerely.

367
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,532
Will I be forgiven just like this?

368
00:18:27,552 --> 00:18:30,172
Please believe in those

369
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:32,052
who contracted with you out of trust.

370
00:18:32,692 --> 00:18:33,952
Sis Sayo.

371
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:38,832
I'm sorry. I once suspected you were
the bad guy who wanted to kill Polka.

372
00:18:39,332 --> 00:18:40,312
Also,

373
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:43,672
if there is such necromancy, there should
also be the magic related to sharks.

374
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:46,612
It's the most important thing right now.

375
00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:47,992
What?

376
00:18:48,072 --> 00:18:50,672
Are you trying to forcefully interrupt us
with the topic of sharks this time?

377
00:18:51,392 --> 00:18:54,272
THE DEEP SEA WIZARD, THE GRIMLOP SISTERS
Indeed, there are people in the ocean who can manipulate schools of fish.

378
00:18:54,772 --> 00:18:56,392
You don't need to go along
with this topic.

379
00:18:57,112 --> 00:18:58,132
In summary,

380
00:18:58,412 --> 00:19:00,932
what we need to consider now
is how to deal with that sign.

381
00:19:01,472 --> 00:19:02,612
Everyone has their own talent.

382
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:05,552
For the matter like this,

383
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:08,132
leave it to an analysis magician like me.

384
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:09,312
You really like that title, huh?

385
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:11,492
In that case,

386
00:19:11,892 --> 00:19:13,592
according to that jerk Solitaire,

387
00:19:13,992 --> 00:19:15,972
I'll start by investigating the police.

388
00:19:17,376 --> 00:19:19,840
ALTHOUGH I CANNOT DISCLOSE THE DETAILS YET, I AM AWARE OF SOME INFORMATION

389
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,672
Really?

390
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:23,426
I WON'T STOP YOU AT THIS POINT, BUT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT, BE CAREFUL

391
00:19:23,426 --> 00:19:26,050
ALTHOUGH IT IS JUST A PART OF IT, THE POLICE ORGANIZATION

392
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,834
IS MUCH MORE FORMIDABLE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.

393
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:30,712
POLICE HEADQUARTERS

394
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,852
Sorry for suddenly calling you here.

395
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:36,772
No problem. It's great to
have Inspector Habaki here.

396
00:19:37,592 --> 00:19:40,552
I ended up returning here after
leaving my original jurisdiction.

397
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:42,872
I really hope

398
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:44,552
that you can be a civil servant
in a proper manner.

399
00:19:44,552 --> 00:19:47,042
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

400
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:49,872
The director is a versatile person.

401
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,572
Be careful not to be overwhelmed
by him. Go in.

402
00:19:53,672 --> 00:19:54,652
Alright.

403
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,392
You're Tsubaki Iwanome,
the one in charge of

404
00:20:01,892 --> 00:20:03,592
the Solitaire's case, right?

405
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:04,952
Yes.

406
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:09,352
You look more like
a male host than a police officer.

407
00:20:10,192 --> 00:20:11,632
After all, your department
is quite special.

408
00:20:11,972 --> 00:20:14,892
As for the earrings and dyed hair,
I'll consider them as your disguise.

409
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:18,952
There's only one important thing.

410
00:20:19,712 --> 00:20:23,112
Can you become a cog that
maintains the organization's operation?

411
00:20:24,272 --> 00:20:26,002
DIRECTOR JIROTAROU TAKANOSU
I hope your cog can

412
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:27,732
mesh smoothly with mine.

413
00:20:29,232 --> 00:20:31,432
JIROTAROU TAKANOSU
Is this the current director of the police?

414
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:35,932
Although judging people by their
appearance is bad, he looks frightening.

415
00:20:36,312 --> 00:20:37,352
He's so cool.

416
00:20:37,632 --> 00:20:38,752
What's so cool about?

417
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:43,832
Iwanome has been frequently investigating
about Mr. Hosorogi.

418
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:50,452
DID THAT GUY ACTUALLY USE AN INTERNAL POLICE COMPUTER FOR THE INVESTIGATION?

419
00:20:50,452 --> 00:20:52,192
That happened a few years ago, right?

420
00:20:52,812 --> 00:20:53,972
THAT GUY DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE A COMPUTER
It seems he was punished for that.

421
00:20:53,972 --> 00:20:55,132
In the police database,

422
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:56,652
there are still such records.

423
00:20:58,812 --> 00:21:00,432
The coordination of the cogs?

424
00:21:01,092 --> 00:21:02,372
I think it is not a problem,

425
00:21:03,092 --> 00:21:05,852
Director Jirotarou Takanosu.

426
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:09,432
After all, I'm very good at
cooperating with others,

427
00:21:10,132 --> 00:21:14,332
unless a stone falls into
the gap between the cogs.

428
00:21:14,832 --> 00:21:16,972
Are you referring to

429
00:21:17,412 --> 00:21:20,182
Prosecutor Miyabi Hosorogi as a stone?

430
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:22,892
It seems I am right.

431
00:21:23,972 --> 00:21:25,732
I can't agree.

432
00:21:26,172 --> 00:21:30,272
Although he is still missing,
you refer to your superior as a stone.

433
00:21:31,592 --> 00:21:35,652
To you, Hosorogi is as worthless
as a small stone on the road.

434
00:21:36,652 --> 00:21:37,892
Right?

435
00:21:42,452 --> 00:21:43,652
You're joking.

436
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,252
What I mentioned is not that person.

437
00:21:47,012 --> 00:21:48,832
It's the dirty rat

438
00:21:49,192 --> 00:21:51,152
hiding in this building

439
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:52,962
that cornered him.

440
00:21:55,332 --> 00:21:58,152
I thought you would impulsively attack me.

441
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:00,192
But you turned out to
be unexpectedly calm.

442
00:22:00,732 --> 00:22:01,812
However,

443
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,952
your words and deeds can hardly be
called calm, which is quite interesting.

444
00:22:05,552 --> 00:22:06,652
I see.

445
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:11,052
When your cog is spinning in the system,
it seems to make a different sound.

446
00:22:11,592 --> 00:22:14,632
But you need to pay more attention.

447
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:17,532
Once I feel that
it is making a different sound,

448
00:22:17,972 --> 00:22:22,472
I will not hesitate to destroy you.

449
00:22:23,612 --> 00:22:24,992
I will keep that in mind.

450
00:22:25,332 --> 00:22:27,512
By the way, before getting to the main
topic, I need to remind you of one thing.

451
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:32,352
My name is not jiroutarou, but jirotarou.

452
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,112
Pronounced jiro, not jirou.

453
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:36,472
Don't drag it too long
when pronouncing it.

454
00:22:37,112 --> 00:22:38,752
WRONG: JIROUTAROU, CORRECT: JIROTAROU
I'll keep this in mind as well.

455
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,112
The reason I called you here today

456
00:22:43,772 --> 00:22:45,432
is because of Phantom Solitaire case.

457
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:49,192
The police decided to reorganize
the investigation team.

458
00:22:49,752 --> 00:22:51,632
And you have an inexplicable
connection with him.

459
00:22:51,732 --> 00:22:54,252
Thus, I hope you can
lead the investigation.

460
00:22:56,472 --> 00:22:57,492
SHINJUKU GYOEN
And then?

461
00:22:58,092 --> 00:23:00,292
Is there any news from the police?

462
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:04,832
Yes, several people hacked into
the police's internal system.

463
00:23:05,252 --> 00:23:08,852
Among them, only one person
has a clear goal.

464
00:23:09,532 --> 00:23:11,072
This is really interesting.

465
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:13,632
Have you figured out
the signal source, granny?

466
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:16,632
GRANNY CAFÉ, AMAGURI
Of course, I have. Young master.

467
00:23:20,212 --> 00:23:22,472
It is in Shinjuku.

468
00:23:23,932 --> 00:23:28,072
A diviner's base with a recently submitted
application for a new business?

469
00:23:29,472 --> 00:23:30,692
It seems I have to ask him

470
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:33,752
to predict my own future for me.

471
00:23:36,096 --> 00:23:39,906
