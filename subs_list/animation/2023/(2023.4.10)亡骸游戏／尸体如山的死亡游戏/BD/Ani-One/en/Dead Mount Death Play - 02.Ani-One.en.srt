00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:03,160
I LONG FOR A PEACEFUL LIFE

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:06,170
I was born with the Evil Eye.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,510
A peaceful life is ultimately
a luxury for me.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,680
I was sold by my parents
to the wizards in the royal palace.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,060
As a necromancer,

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,770
I constantly participated in the battle.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,310
Therefore,

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,460
for a long time before
the downfall of the country,

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,770
I had always

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,020
wanted to live a quiet and peaceful life.

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:36,710
I long for a peaceful life,

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,280
even if it's an illusion

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,910
or it's temporary.

14
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,680
I just hope to have

15
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,110
the peaceful life that still
lingers in my memory.

16
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,080
A peaceful life.

17
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,510
I long for a peaceful life.

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,750
That's all I want.

19
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,200
They have been infected.

20
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,600
Eliminate their souls.

21
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,080
We cannot let these souls
be used by the necromancer.

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,040
Please grant them redemption.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,460
Grant redemption to
the infected children.

24
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,660
The more I desire,
the more I cannot obtain.

25
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,710
So I started my revenge.

26
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,934
I spent hundreds of years on it.

27
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,950
We are wrong.

28
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,550
Please grant us redemption.

29
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,260
Please grant us redemption.

30
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,880
We are so pitiful.

31
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,280
Please kill us.

32
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,820
I don't know if
it was the screams of those guys

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,730
or my necromancy magic
that attracted them.

34
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,240
Gradually, the mine where I was hiding

35
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,020
turned into a maze of crawling undead.

36
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:19,820
But even so,

37
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,720
I still long for a peaceful life.

38
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,680
So I've been waiting.

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,730
I spent decades, even centuries waiting

40
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,770
for someone to kill me,

41
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,400
who cannot commit suicide.

42
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,000
After that, the
resurrection magic succeeded,

43
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,930
so

44
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,550
I cannot just die here

45
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,820
for no reason.

46
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,110
Why did she die so easily?

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,530
It was just one stab in the abdomen.

48
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,680
Didn't she have any healing potions

49
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,730
or auto-healing magic items?

50
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,730
This is bad.

51
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:02,880
Where am I?

52
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,480
I killed her

53
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,680
before I could gather any information.

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,130
No, instead of gathering information,

55
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,020
I should ensure my own safety first.

56
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,910
If that's the case,
I can't even prove that

57
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,200
my actions were in self-defense
against the assassin.

58
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,750
If I'm pursued by guards,

59
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,420
my desired peaceful life
will be ruined again.

60
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,130
By the way,

61
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,110
just now I said something like,

62
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,930
"All right, let's continue."

63
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,180
(Dead Mount, Death Play)

64
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,240
Is my head

65
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,620
really messed up?

66
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,400
Hey.

67
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,420
It's been so long.
Why hasn't it been resolved yet?

68
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,020
Did you encounter any trouble again?

69
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,840
Oh, Clarissa.

70
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,400
It's even worse.

71
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:19,420
The system has crashed.

72
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,710
I'm sending the footage over now.

73
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,000
Footage?

74
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,370
After you watch it, let me know
what happened.

75
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,570
Let me know if I have gone crazy

76
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,310
or if Shinjuku has gone crazy.

77
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,820
Misaki, Misaki.

78
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,200
Misaki is so cute.

79
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,620
Misaki really loves to smile.

80
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,710
It's a good thing to love to smile.

81
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,460
Your smile

82
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,660
will definitely bring happiness to others.

83
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,600
You need to become happy with everyone.

84
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,600
Mi…sa…ki…

85
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,330
Hey, hey, do you remember who I am?

86
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,080
You... you're…

87
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,800
Zaki, are you the Assassin Hunter Zaki?

88
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,330
You're right.

89
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,200
But there's something wrong.

90
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:27,480
Darn it, don't think that just because
you have gained Clarissa's appreciation,

91
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,060
-she will forgive you for doing it?
-This is Clarissa's request.

92
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,170
Uncle, you've been killing too many
people who aren't our targets.

93
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,040
So she sent me to kill you.

94
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,060
In my opinion,

95
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,110
you actually find pleasure in killing.

96
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,400
How do you feel now?

97
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,150
You are about to be killed by me?
Are you happy?

98
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,930
Do you think

99
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,020
I look as happy now

100
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,680
as you did back then?

101
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,040
Are you from the Sakimiya family…

102
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,800
Are you here to seek revenge on me,

103
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,770
or are you pretending to
be a righteous partner

104
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,400
by choosing to kill some assassins

105
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,260
or people from the underworld?

106
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,090
You're such a hypocrite.

107
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,770
No, no, that's not it.

108
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,660
When I saw you killing people,
I started thinking

109
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,220
whether taking other people's life

110
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,130
can make one happy?

111
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,260
The reason I hunt assassins

112
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,020
is because I find it interesting.

113
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,890
That's it.

114
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,420
By the way,

115
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,000
I need to confirm one thing.

116
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,530
Am I killing a good guy?

117
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,260
Are you a good guy?

118
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,410
Yes, I…

119
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,750
No way!

120
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,220
It's her, right?

121
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,200
The killer named Zaki.

122
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,840
That strange girl who smiles
while killing people.

123
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,840
Why did Miss Clarissa take in that kid?

124
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,080
Do you want to take on this mission?

125
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,000
This guy is not a killer.

126
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,420
He's just a kid.

127
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,110
It's okay.

128
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,420
Anyway, I've already
achieved my life goal.

129
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,080
I want to confirm

130
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,200
how abnormal

131
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,000
I really am.

132
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,060
I killed him.

133
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,950
I can indeed

134
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,770
kill anyone,

135
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,820
regardless of
whether they are good or bad.

136
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,310
Living in this world is terrible

137
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,910
for people like me.

138
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,970
No one can achieve happiness.

139
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,710
Whether they're good guy, bad guy,
or Clarissa,

140
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,420
Kuruya, Hagane,

141
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,910
and me,

142
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,150
it is impossible for us
to achieve happiness.

143
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,860
I only have one thing left to try.

144
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,770
That's killing myself.

145
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Hello?

146
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,260
It's me, Kuruya.

147
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,240
What's up, Kuruya?

148
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,770
I'm enjoying the peak

149
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,460
of my life right now.

150
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,040
I can see that.

151
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,600
Ah, I see the drone.

152
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,220
If you want to die, go ahead.

153
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,150
But wait until you finish the job first.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,240
The kid

155
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,550
whose throat you just cut

156
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,280
is now walking around
like nothing happened.

157
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,680
What?

158
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,080
Are you saying I didn't kill that kid?

159
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,840
That's right.

160
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:37,240
You haven't finished your job yet.

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,800
Huh? What's going on?

162
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,020
I remember talking to Kuruya

163
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,680
about this just now.

164
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:48,480
Ah, so what I saw earlier

165
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,330
was just an illusion?

166
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,400
Great, you're finally awake.

167
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,400
It looks like I succeeded.

168
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,080
But why? My abdomen was stabbed.

169
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,350
I died, right?

170
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,260
Why am I alive?

171
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,260
No,

172
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,000
you didn't come back to life.

173
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,640
It's more like you were reborn with magic.

174
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,280
So,

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,110
what's the situation here?

176
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,400
Clarissa.

177
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,310
Clarissa from intermediary agency.

178
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,420
Why are you here?

179
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,930
Your body are cold,

180
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,880
and your pulse has stopped completely.

181
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,710
Verification is done.

182
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,730
You are definitely dead.

183
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,710
Let me think... You're a zombie,

184
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,680
according to the language here.

185
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:56,280
Hey guys, are you all okay?

186
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,240
Although this is a document that

187
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,860
I recorded at random,

188
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,910
if anyone sees it,

189
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,880
I've probably gone crazy by that time.

190
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,080
40 MINUTES BEFORE MISAKI SAKIMIYA WOKE UP

191
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,820
My name is Takumi Kuruya.

192
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,820
I'm a good guy in Shinjuku.

193
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,840
I engage in selling information

194
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,620
by using the internet and drones.

195
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,390
Of course, I don't have a flying license.

196
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,480
But for some reason,

197
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,570
I also help killers

198
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,240
hide bodies and the like.

199
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,730
Overall, I plan to

200
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,820
live carefully

201
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,240
and cautiously

202
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,460
now and in the future.

203
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,570
But why did things turn out like this?

204
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,910
Sorry to interrupt your data collection.

205
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,880
Polka Shinoyama.

206
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,350
May I call you that?

207
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,640
Before I formally greet you,
I have a question for you.

208
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,480
What are you doing?

209
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,340
Kuruya, what's going on?

210
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,930
That's not me.

211
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,680
I haven't been able to control
the drone since earlier.

212
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,710
Can a drone fly

213
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,860
without making any sound?

214
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
That's impossible.

215
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,260
Please wait a moment.

216
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,200
I'll fix her.

217
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,280
It doesn't appear to be

218
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,730
CG image made by Kuruya.

219
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,730
If I could make that kind of thing,

220
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,060
I could make a living off this skill.

221
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,770
She should wake up soon.

222
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,770
Who are you guys?

223
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,080
We're friends of that child, Misaki.

224
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,110
We planned to take over Misaki's job

225
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,440
and get revenge for her.

226
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,880
Can I assume she's still alive?

227
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,330
Well, her current state
is a bit complicated.

228
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,020
Although I only did a simple procedure,

229
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,060
her brain and soul are fine now,

230
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,820
and her body has been fixed.

231
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,600
Later, when she wakes up,

232
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,840
we just need a sorcerer
to cast a resurrection magic,

233
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
and she can come back to life.

234
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,150
I'm talking about resurrection magic.

235
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,200
Magic.

236
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,400
There is indeed such
knowledge in this body.

237
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,540
Something like a resurrection
or revival spell.

238
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,480
Are you talking about a spell
in a video game?

239
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,750
Denji Yuki?

240
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,420
Excuse me, is there anyone in this country

241
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,510
who can use magic or divine technique?

242
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,110
As far as I know,

243
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,450
only you in front of me at the moment.

244
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,110
What about other countries?

245
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,770
There are a bunch of guys
who claim to be magicians,

246
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,970
but I've never heard of that %&$ Empire

247
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,910
or ¥@# Kingdom.

248
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,130
How did you pronounce what you just said?

249
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,480
What you guys just saw
is a collective hallucination.

250
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,480
Do you think you can fool me with that?

251
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,460
Hallucinations are really scary.

252
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,480
I couldn't fool you?

253
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,910
You monster.

254
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,970
I can't understand

255
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,640
how fragile you guys are

256
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,800
and how easy it is to kill you.

257
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,370
What should I do?

258
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,280
Can you give me some time to think?

259
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,080
You're really calm.

260
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,280
Okay, I'll wait for you.

261
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
He actually agreed.

262
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:39,000
Doesn't this guy have
any sense of nervousness?

263
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,420
No. Should I say
he's just too experienced?

264
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,460
The weapons these people are holding

265
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,570
are very similar to the ones used by
the Imperial Gorgeous Unit.

266
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,170
It's really scary.

267
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,080
Should I run or fight?

268
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,930
Do I still have enough magic?

269
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,100
What should I do?

270
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,650
The sound of the fire truck is so close.

271
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,200
I don't know why there are
many fire accidents lately.

272
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,020
There is a fire at
the Shakuzawa Building.

273
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,200
My camera can capture it.

274
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,970
Shakuzawa Building.

275
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,860
I'm really worried about the kids,

276
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,660
but all we can do now

277
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,570
is leave it to the firefighters.

278
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,240
What's on the screen?

279
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,480
It's the fire.

280
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,600
Why did you say that
you worried about the kids?

281
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,800
There's an unlicensed kindergarten

282
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,660
in the Shakuzawa Building

283
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,150
for kids whose mom

284
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,020
works in the service industry

285
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,680
or whose parents died because they
got involved with the underworld.

286
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,060
I hope you can take me there right away.

287
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,710
If you don't know where the building is,

288
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,150
then it's not your problem, right?

289
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,500
Why do you care about this?

290
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,750
I've been burned a few times before,

291
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,150
and it's an extremely painful experience.

292
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,300
Kids shouldn't have to
endure that kind of pain.

293
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Okay.

294
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,470
Kuruya, show him the way.

295
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,470
Hey, are you serious?

296
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,120
He might run away halfway through.

297
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,750
So you have to keep an eye on him.

298
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,550
That is it.

299
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,750
Wait!

300
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,550
What's up with that guy?

301
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,170
He's gotten a lot stronger as compared to

302
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,320
when he was running away from Misaki.

303
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,150
I see it. That's the building.

304
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,350
Now I can enhance my Evil Eye with magic,

305
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:14,670
and I can also sense the kids' life.

306
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:17,220
Fire trucks and onlookers

307
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,000
have surrounded the area. What should…

308
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,620
Did something fly in just now?

309
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,320
I didn't see it.

310
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,370
Are you the parents of those kids?

311
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:46,320
Please help me out.

312
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,920
Hey, hey, the fire is spreading too fast.

313
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,600
Is there something up there?

314
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,400
What is it?

315
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,950
Daddy?

316
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,450
It was really hot just now,

317
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,270
but now it's not hot or
uncomfortable at all.

318
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:33,400
It's because of my dad's warm hand.

319
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,700
Was there something powerful

320
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,320
in the smoke just now?

321
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:00,820
Even though the kids
were eventually rescued,

322
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,870
would a normal person do that
kind of thing in front of onlookers?

323
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,270
And he flew out just
like when he went in,

324
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,700
with a bang.

325
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,300
I cannot understand

326
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,400
this guy's ethics?

327
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,750
He treated Misaki's life

328
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,620
like a toy

329
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,100
and now he's trying to save a kid.

330
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,600
That's such a huge contrast.

331
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,070
It's so hard to understand.

332
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,720
I don't get what he's thinking.

333
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,450
He just seems different from us.

334
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,020
This guy is definitely a monster

335
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,650
that we can't associate with.

336
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,300
Sis Clarissa.

337
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,700
Maybe.

338
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,870
Misaki

339
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,020
is about to wake up now.

340
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,800
You need to go back to the
abandoned building right away.

341
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,450
Really?

342
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,420
She's about to wake up?
Are you kidding me?

343
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,870
What's going on now?

344
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,970
Hey, you said I was dead,

345
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,450
what's the matter?

346
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,850
I don't understand. Please tell me.

347
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,270
But on another note,

348
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,370
even in a developed country,

349
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,750
there are unfortunate and
difficult situations for children.

350
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,250
How to live a peaceful life

351
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,970
in this country?

352
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,950
It depends on

353
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,050
what you mean by peaceful life.

354
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,070
Personally,

355
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,550
I think money

356
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,450
is essential for a peaceful life.

357
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,220
She's materialistic.

358
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,720
Is money essential in every country?

359
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,050
Who are you?

360
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,520
Let me put it this way.

361
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,120
What's your wish?

362
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,370
What do you want to do in this city?

363
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,220
Even though I don't know anything
about this place,

364
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,520
if I'm the only one

365
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:58,400
who can use Spirit of Dead Thread,

366
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,150
I want to make money with it.

367
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,720
I want a peaceful life,

368
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,620
power that can
prevent others from interrupting,

369
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,720
and a place to stay more than anyone else.

370
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,000
In that case,

371
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,390
