1
00:00:04,344 --> 00:00:06,524
Huh? Who's that?

2
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:16,864
Hey, boss. Wait for me.

3
00:00:16,864 --> 00:00:19,204
Didn't you say
I could do whatever I wanted?

4
00:00:19,204 --> 00:00:22,384
So I destroyed the roof and ran over here.

5
00:00:22,764 --> 00:00:25,864
You had already exceeded
the agreed-upon time limit of 3 minutes.

6
00:00:25,964 --> 00:00:26,964
Hmph.

7
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:32,204
What's wrong?

8
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:35,444
I just had a strange feeling.

9
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:37,944
Strange feeling?

11
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,040
(Episode 19: The Friends)

12
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,600
I shouldn't have dragged you into
what's basically my mess.

14
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,980
But, Mr. Iwa,
it's no longer just your problem.

15
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,820
Your reaction to Prosecutor Hosorogi's
issues was far too personal.

16
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,020
Um.

17
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,520
Given Solitaire's involved,

18
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,260
this has always been under
the jurisdiction of Comps-3.

19
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,680
You're right.

20
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,520
Now that the media's gotten
a whiff of the Habaki case,

21
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,380
this is gonna get big.

22
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,000
Leader, you could become
the target of reporters yourself.

23
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,000
It might be best for you
to keep a low profile for now.

24
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,980
Yatsu, pops.

25
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,860
Sorry. We weren't able to locate Habaki.

26
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,400
Never mind.

27
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,180
I want to seize him
before he escapes overseas,

28
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,600
but we don't know the scope
or magnitude of his organization.

29
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,680
Don't let your guard down.

30
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

31
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,300
Let's just hope we can end this
before it comes to that.

32
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,820
I don't remember
summoning you here, Your Majesty.

33
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,800
Please, don't be so cold.

34
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,520
Just coming out here was tough.

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,860
Moreover, you ignored
my advice 100 years ago.

36
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,580
Perhaps it's your turn to suffer now.

37
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,120
Relax.

38
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,220
I came here without permission.

39
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,640
So I'll be gone soon enough.

40
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,980
But how splendid that I was able to learn
the words from this side, thanks to you.

41
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,900
What a cutie.

42
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,740
This world seems like a lot of fun.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,920
Everyone wants to have a firsthand look.

44
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,720
I apologize, but…

45
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,980
It's okay.

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,820
I will wait patiently.

47
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,600
Until your heart wishes it so.

48
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,320
Someday…

49
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,060
For certain…

50
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
Who is he?

51
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,340
A friend of mine.

52
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,880
From the other world.

53
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,180
I see.

54
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,060
You have a good friend.

55
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,520
That's right.

56
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Although I'm not sure
when it comes to this world…

57
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,640
But I know that you are still you,

58
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,340
and I am still me.

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,640
Dear friend.

60
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,980
Whether we're alive or dead.

61
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Oh, right.

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,920
I know I said not to think of revenge,

63
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:46,020
but I didn't mean you should renounce
all hatred and become a saint either.

64
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,520
Call it one of my little indulgences.

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,400
P-Please…

66
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,360
Stop…

67
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,080
Easlies.

68
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,600
The old lady and I were opposed
to letting Corpse God see this…

69
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm sorry!

70
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,600
Forgive me!

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,400
Taking on people's dirty work is my duty.

72
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,060
So…

73
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,020
There's no need for you
to get your hands dirty,

74
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,260
my dear friend.

75
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,640
Such conceited thinking is

76
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,140
what got you assassinated, Your Majesty.

77
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,080
Maybe so.

78
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,020
So he's disappeared.

79
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,520
I'd planned to wait
and see what would happen,

80
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,160
but I guess I'll start tomorrow.

81
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,980
This city's absolutely crawling
with troublemakers.

82
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,320
We've got the bug
and my comrade from back home.

83
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,860
Which should I prioritize first?

84
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,020
My wish remains the same
as it was before, Your Majesty.

85
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,640
I wish for a world
where everyone can live in peace.

86
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,920
A world where you don't have
to get your hands dirty.

87
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,640
That's why

88
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,740
I have to venture even deeper.

89
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,240
Into the shadows of that world
which are blending into this one.

90
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,020
Mr. Habaki.

91
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,900
I hope the higher-ups will

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,140
take care of you before you reveal me.

93
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,120
It seems that I need to hide for a while.

94
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,740
I'll have to lose this phone somewhere
in the next few hours-

95
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
Hot!

96
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,040
Oh dear. You dropped your phone.

97
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,080
Sorry about that.

98
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,180
Huh?

99
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,860
Huh? Wait.

100
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,140
Excuse me?

101
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,460
Hands and feet.

102
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,980
of Sabaramond.

103
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,460
-Eyes.
-Ears.

104
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,880
Catch him.

105
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,460
Maybe I shouldn't have run away.
This is bad.

106
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,060
Oh, hello? Polka?

107
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,240
We are back.

108
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,780
Is everything okay with you?

109
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,400
Yeah, I'm with Miss Clarissa now.

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,000
Will packing tape do?

111
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,420
For nice.

112
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,260
This sure is well made.

113
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,760
Aren't you surprised?

114
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,860
About what?

115
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,980
This is Shinoyama company tech, right?

116
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,060
I've asked them to create
a shark robot before.

117
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,900
I-I see…

118
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,900
Besides, I always knew you were keeping at
least one or two secrets from me, Xiaoyu.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,700
I mean, if you could transform
into a shark or something,

120
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,560
then I'd definitely be surprised,
and I'd probably ask you to marry me.

121
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,340
Get married…

122
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,760
Even if you can't tell me your secrets,
there are still some things I know.

123
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,260
I know you've worked
so hard to protect us.

124
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,860
Thank you.

125
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,420
No…

126
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,100
I only acted

127
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,060
for my own benefit.

128
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,240
Kurupon, answer the phone.

129
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,400
Hmm?

130
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,080
Hello, Takumi?

131
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,400
I heard you hurt your leg.

132
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,340
Drop by the bar later.

133
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,160
I'll ask Kazami to take a look at you
and give you some medicine.

134
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,440
Look, all I need is to stop the bleeding…

135
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,380
No arguing. Just get it treated.

136
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,620
Geez.

137
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,020
Injuries worry me.

138
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,560
An injury that's not treated properly

139
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,880
can come back to haunt you later.

140
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,800
Clarissa,

141
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,480
your vision…

142
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,240
Polka, I need you to ask her something

143
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,120
Um…

144
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,920
Miss Clarissa, why do you care
about this Habaki person?

145
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,020
Well…

146
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,460
You're curious?

147
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,420
Yes.

148
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,140
I was just too stubborn.

149
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,560
The reason I was able to find him

150
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,420
was thanks to the information
from the police.

151
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,720
It can't be. Just who?

152
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
ONE HOUR AGO
So you can get Habaki's location.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,840
Yes. I planted a GPS chip in his sleeve.

154
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,060
You're sure you this is
what you want? Mr. Tozawa?

155
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,680
Yes. I've thought it through.

156
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,220
I know that my grandfather
saved your wife once.

157
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,560
Do you feel so indebted to me
that you would betray Tsubaki Iwanome?

158
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,480
It's not about repaying any debt.

159
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,300
I don't think this incident falls into
the category of even a troublemaker.

160
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:46,400
I want Iwanome
to be an upstanding police inspector.

161
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,980
I don't want him to stray from
that path the way I did.

162
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,380
You're awfully overprotective of him.

163
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,880
He's competent,

164
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,260
but he's still fragile.

165
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,700
Until he's… No…

166
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:04,040
Until Comps-3 has matured, I want them
to walk the straight and narrow.

167
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,940
That's all this is about.

168
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,440
Okay! Let's start by taking a fresh look
at Inspector Habaki's call log.

169
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:14,880
Not only that. Check all precinct
and town surveillance cameras.

170
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,700
See who's had any contact with Habaki
and the police officer who killed himself.

171
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,800
Yes, sir!

172
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,740
DO NOT DWELL ON THE PAST. THE FILTH HAS ALREADY PERMEATED THE UPPER LEVELS
I'll be in charge this with Arase.

173
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,100
You sure are pulling out all the stops.

174
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,220
I know it's not fair to you, but I might
still be a little emotional, you know?

175
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:32,020
No matter how hard I try,
I will never catch Hosorogi.

176
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,120
So we'll just need him to come to us.

177
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,680
Have him come to us?

178
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,980
How?

179
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,500
We'll use force.

180
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,060
We're going to completely smoke out
the organization that Habaki is a part of.

181
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,400
It's likely "Sabaramond"
is the key word here.

182
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,020
We're going to arrest
everyone who is related.

183
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,060
I'm just making a place that
Mr. Hosorogi will come home to.

184
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,780
Let's say, uh…

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,440
If I could find Mr. Hosorogi's soul,

186
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,860
is there anything you'd want to tell him?

187
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,980
Huh?

188
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Polka?

189
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,920
I'm sorry for doing this
without your permission.

190
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,560
Yes.

191
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,540
I trampled all over his wishes.

192
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,480
Mr. Miyabi wouldn't like to see
what I've turned into.

193
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,600
He doesn't like it.

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,240
According to my grandfather,
I inherited the intermediary agency.

195
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,780
But I am who I am.

196
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,500
That's an undeniable truth,
and I have no regrets over it.

197
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
So,

198
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,300
there's just one thing I'd want to say.

199
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,520
If that person comes back,

200
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,260
there's one thing
I should say to him first.

201
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,020
Mr. Hosorogi.

202
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,720
Farewell.

203
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,820
My beloved.

204
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,360
I look forward to continuing
to work with you.

205
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,800
Huh?

206
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,480
What's going on here?

207
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
Hm.

208
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,520
I see you're awake.

209
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
Who is this?

210
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,480
Misaki! Takumi!

211
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,740
Welcome back.

212
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,960
Misaki, it seems you're okay.

213
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,280
Yes, I'm fine.

214
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,100
Takumi.

215
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,520
If you like, I could use
a flesh-restoring spell.

216
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,160
Huh? You can do that?

217
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,300
I'd have to make part of
your body a zombie first.

218
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,120
No, thanks, I'll stick
with the regular treatment.

219
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,320
If I'm ever mortally wounded, though,
you can bet I'll be asking you then.

220
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
Hm.

221
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,380
Things can't carry on like this.

222
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,960
If I want a world
where I can live in peace with everyone,

223
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,060
I need to be willing to take more
determined steps toward that end.

224
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,300
I have to go much deeper
as the "Corpse God"

225
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,080
into this world.

226
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,540
Hmm. A moment of your time.

227
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,860
Who is this we have sitting here?

228
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,380
An innocent, average citizen who happened
to learn Fire-breathing Bug's true identity?

229
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,880
Perhaps

230
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,500
you're with Habaki from the precinct?

231
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,520
In other words,
he's a party concerned with this symbol.

232
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,020
So far you've burned every last person
related to the organization.

233
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,460
But you must have realized your way
of doing things had drawbacks.

234
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,660
When the organization goes public,

235
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,420
the situation will change drastically.

236
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,900
So you tried a new approach!

237
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,380
The root of the organization is key.

238
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,740
In other words,

239
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,880
having dragged this man and Habaki to the forefront,
you mean to rely on my abilities?

240
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,040
That's exactly it.

241
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,860
That's right.

242
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,100
As I'd expect from you.

243
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,040
Sometimes, being a magician requires
the art of conversation.

244
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,700
This much is only natural for me.

245
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:01,080
I thought he was just a criminal
with a screw loose, but…

246
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,080
-The magician's operation…
-This was actually all thoroughly calculated.

247
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,820
-So that's what it is.
-Right?

248
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,180
I've actually hit the nail on the head.

249
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,760
Though I'd hoped to react with surprise
after being told, "You're totally wrong"!

250
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Um…

251
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,900
I have no idea what any
of this has to do with me,

252
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,580
so could you just let me go home?

253
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,220
Mm.

254
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,600
I can tell that you're involved
with all the troublemakers.

255
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,080
You've got the smell of someone
who's killed countless people.

256
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,640
So anything I do will be forgiven.

257
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,300
Or I'm screwed!

258
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,040
Do you have any proof?

259
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,720
If I'm just an ordinary citizen,

260
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,140
won't this whole mix-up be
a terrible blow to your pride?

261
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,020
Worry not.

262
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,980
My pride is still

263
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,880
PRIDE
in a jail cell.

264
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,300
Mm? What?

265
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:54,900
The fact is, I am a bother
to ordinary citizens.

266
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,240
Especially when I abducted
PM Kubikigawara.

267
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,480
As a result of my actions, a lot
of companies' stock prices took a dive.

268
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,840
It seems Solitaire infiltrated
the police station.

269
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,440
Damn joyful offender.

270
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,660
Looks like there was movement
in Polka's building too.

271
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,120
Yes.

272
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,800
The intelligence dealer was wounded.

273
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,800
And the young lady's bodyguard

274
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,136
had one of his prosthetic limbs cut off.

275
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,648
It's possible they had a run-in with
an enemy force of some kind.

276
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,920
So formal.

277
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,160
He's still a part
of your family, remember?

278
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,440
He cut ties with the Lei family.

279
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,960
No need to worry.

280
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,260
Even so, he is still rather capable.

281
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,780
Our opponent isn't just some
small-time punk, is what you're saying.

282
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,080
The enemy's hand has gradually reached us.

283
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,420
Oh?

284
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,620
Since nightfall, a number of the lookouts
have been attacked.

285
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,940
Everyone's phone has been invaded.

286
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,940
In other words, someone is
looking for information.

287
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,080
What's more…

288
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,120
All the money in
my bank account has disappeared.

289
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,120
So they're attacking individuals as well?

290
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,520
Look into it, Bao.

291
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,940
Roger.

292
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,440
ACCOUNT BALANCE 237,380,000 JAPANESE YEN
That really is a huge sum of money deposited.

293
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,840
I TRANSFERRED ALL TAIPEI'S MONEY TO YOUR ACCOUNT
My sister is so merciless.

294
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Oh right,

295
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,280
I need to report the matter
of the arm to Master.

296
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,960
Hey. It's me.

297
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,480
I heard.

298
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,100
One of your arms got ruined.

299
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,120
Huh? Yeah…

300
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,860
I had a run-in with the Agakura.

301
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,260
Ah, yeah, I heard about that too.

302
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Huh?

303
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,240
What matters is that you're alive.

304
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,680
And I hear you protected the guys
from the building too.

305
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,580
You did well.

306
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,020
Thank you, Xiaoyu.

307
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,100
Y-You don't have to thank me, Master!

308
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,020
So how are your arms and legs?

309
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,800
All good.

310
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,620
My arm's completely destroyed,

311
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,800
so it looks like I'll have
to get by one-handed for a while.

312
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,720
I'm so sorry.

313
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,620
I broke the thing you gave me, Master.

314
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,820
Don't worry about it.

315
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,920
And…

316
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,920
The guy behind you says
he'll take care of it for you.

317
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Behind me?

318
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
When did he get here?

319
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,840
Xiaoyu. I heard about

320
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,640
you saving Takumi.

321
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,280
I only acted because not doing so may
have allowed harm to come to Lady Sayo.

322
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,900
Please let me prepare you a new arm.

323
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,680
My job is to protect the Shinoyamas.

324
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,380
That's why…

325
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,180
I don't trust you.

326
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,840
The person who was under
the floor in Mr. Rozan's room…

327
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,300
Was it you, wasn't it?

328
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,060
I could tell right away because
of your unique color of the soul.

329
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,860
That's also how I knew you already
recognized me as a fake.

330
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,520
Color of the soul?

331
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,180
What are you talking about?

332
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,040
I'll explain everything.

333
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,880
So, first of all,

334
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,440
I want you to have a serious bout with me.

335
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
What?

336
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,740
This is just what I wanted.

337
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm going to expose
who he really is to the Master.

338
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,540
Don't think I'll bow my head
to you in front of the Master.

339
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,880
I'm not thinking that at all.

340
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,520
You saved Takumi.
There's no need for you to defer to me.

341
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,260
Enough talk. Take your stance.

342
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,280
Oh, it's not me who's going
to fight with you.

343
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,240
It is my power,
so it's almost the same thing.

344
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,200
Your opponent will be
this dual-fanged tiger.

345
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,040
Though it can't maintain for long,

346
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,040
show me your strength as best you can.

347
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,840
What is this monster?

348
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,880
A hallucination? Hypnosis?

349
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,640
Oh dear.

350
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,680
The situation is even more
exaggerated than I expected.

351
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,100
When I received your call last night,
I was really taken aback.

352
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,940
The Agakura are
the ones who picked off his limbs.

353
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,900
I thought he'd do something reckless
and put his life in danger.

354
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,820
It's easy to tell him,

355
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,980
"Don't push yourself too hard. If you want
to run away, you can run away."

356
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,240
But that makes him all the more
determined to do the opposite.

357
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,500
I can see that.

358
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,620
I've seen plenty of people who prioritize
their feelings over their lives.

359
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,740
By the way,

360
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,180
if your goal is to live in peace,

361
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:42,920
then I'd have figured you'd want
to keep your secret from Xiaoyu.

362
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
Yeah.

363
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,220
In holding back,

364
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,640
one can end up losing so much more.

365
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,000
For the sake of my future peace,

366
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,600
let's put it aside for now.

367
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,180
Let's stop here.

368
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,540
I've got the picture.

369
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,980
Thank you, Gufa. Rafa.

370
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,780
Ah! Hey!

371
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,540
Sorry, they seem to really like you.

372
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,040
Um…

373
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,800
Anyway, take a shower first.

374
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,060
If only my right arm and legs
were in full working order…

375
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,400
No, I took that bout
as seriously as any I've fought.

376
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,060
But he…

377
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,860
Even with that incomprehensible power…

378
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,800
I'm certain he was far
from taking our bout seriously.

379
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,980
Oh.

380
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,180
Welcome back.

381
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,960
This is what the joints look like.

382
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,720
So can you do something about my arm?

383
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,780
Thank you.

384
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,420
What's your name?

385
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,300
You must have a real name.

386
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,700
Your strength is indisputable.

387
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,790
So it doesn't feel right for me

388
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,240
HAPPY SHARK DANCE
to keep referring to you as "the fake."

389
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,040
Most people call me,

390
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,680
"Corpse God."

391
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,300
That's quite the hefty title.

392
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,820
Yes, I think so too.

393
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Speaking of which,
didn't you challenge me to

394
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,480
that fight to make the pecking order
clear once and for all?

395
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,060
I risked my life and pride.

396
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,020
So, what are you planning
to do about my arm?

397
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,520
Oh, I just finished.

398
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,420
Huh?

399
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,380
Whose arm is this?

400
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,300
Answer me! Corpse God!

401
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,580
Urdwigia.

402
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,320
It's the right arm of the colossal lighting dragon
that used to bathe the world in electricity.

403
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,880
Dragon?

404
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,640
Xiaoyu.

405
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,300
I want to make a deal
in exchange for this arm.

406
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,000
As the fourth-ranking sorcerer
in the imperial court,

407
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,700
I want you to make an alliance with me.
