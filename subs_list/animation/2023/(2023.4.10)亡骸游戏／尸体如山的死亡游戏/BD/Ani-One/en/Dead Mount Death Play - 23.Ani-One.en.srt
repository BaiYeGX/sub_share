1
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,790
Sorry, I'm late.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:08,630
I ran into some trouble.

3
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,970
So,

4
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,970
what kind of fire
are you going to show me?

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,730
According to my friends,
I'm like a moth flying into flame.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,990
If it's a beautiful flame,
it's worth flying into.

00:01:58,106 --> 00:01:59,126
(Episode 23: The Declaration)
What's wrong?

9
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,726
Jackpot.

10
00:02:00,926 --> 00:02:02,946
As expected of Mr. Hosorogi.

11
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:05,806
Here are some facts about the fire
that happened 100 years ago.

12
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:08,426
You know, about that house
we went to yesterday.

13
00:02:12,806 --> 00:02:14,046
Who are you?

14
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:16,626
Oh, pardon us.

15
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:18,706
We do not belong to any suspicious person.

16
00:02:19,046 --> 00:02:20,486
This is my ID.

17
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,446
We are police from
the Community Safety Division.

18
00:02:23,446 --> 00:02:25,586
We're interviewing people in the area.

19
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,326
According to that man,

20
00:02:28,526 --> 00:02:32,286
he has been asked by the property
owner to manage the home.

21
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:35,286
The owner confirmed

22
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:38,546
that the guy wasn't lying.

23
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:40,026
Yes.

24
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,946
That's why we weren't able
to do much digging back there.

25
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:46,006
But with this documentation,
we might be able to do something.

26
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:48,226
Thank you, Mr. Hosorogi.

27
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:51,266
I will definitely find out the truth.

28
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:54,046
And reveal the enigmatic
mask of Sabaramond.

29
00:02:57,626 --> 00:03:00,646
By the way, Clarissa,
what are we doing about tomorrow?

30
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:02,506
This time we'll only be watching.

31
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,126
Is that okay?

32
00:03:04,466 --> 00:03:07,586
I want to get a grasp
of exactly how far he'll go.

33
00:03:08,286 --> 00:03:11,566
Of course, as the mediator, we'll at least
fulfill the bare minimum of our promise.

34
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:17,186
Watching over them will
require appropriate preparations too.

35
00:03:18,626 --> 00:03:20,906
What are those three up to?

36
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:24,706
They made contact with someone
who appeared to be Solitaire last night.

37
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,126
But there's been
no further movement since.

38
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:30,006
Are they hostile toward Solitaire?

39
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,846
The mob with the umbrellas…

40
00:03:34,486 --> 00:03:35,466
Fire.

41
00:03:36,346 --> 00:03:37,686
Solitaire.

42
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,566
Could it be Fire-breathing Bug?

43
00:03:44,046 --> 00:03:46,126
It's almost time.

44
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,786
That Taipei guy is coming, right?

45
00:03:49,126 --> 00:03:53,906
Honestly, I don't quite understand
who those three people are.

46
00:03:54,386 --> 00:03:56,192
But if I can get him to understand

47
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:59,246
that they're a threat
to Shinoyama's existence.

48
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:00,866
And we need to get their help.

49
00:04:01,446 --> 00:04:03,966
What happens after we save Polka?

50
00:04:04,526 --> 00:04:08,226
I think I should be able
to hold back the elf.

51
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:11,546
That's where me and Xiaoyu
come in. Hee hee.

52
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:14,046
I've almost perfected
my right arm for how to use it.

53
00:04:14,346 --> 00:04:16,566
I've also been training
with that tiger earlier.

54
00:04:16,766 --> 00:04:17,806
Hey, listen.

55
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:21,366
Even in shark films, it's those characters
without names who die first.

56
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,506
Where is this coming from?

57
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,036
I think we ought to think
about how we'll refer to

58
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:26,606
the real Polka versus you.

59
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:30,026
It could get confusing
when we're in the thick of it.

60
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,586
"Corpse God", I know it's your name,

61
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:35,766
but it is hard to pronounce in Japanese.

62
00:04:37,506 --> 00:04:38,666
Polka?

63
00:04:38,906 --> 00:04:40,906
Sorry, I lied.

64
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,726
True, it's a little hard to say,

65
00:04:43,966 --> 00:04:45,626
but not impossible to pronounce.

66
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:48,320
It just reminds me of bad times,

67
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,926
so I don't like to say my own name.

68
00:04:50,846 --> 00:04:53,946
But this is as good an opportunity
as any, so I'll tell it to you now.

69
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:55,826
My name is…

70
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:58,186
Wait.

71
00:04:58,306 --> 00:05:00,906
The real Polka is on the move.

72
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:06,586
The two women

73
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:07,946
have left the hotel.

74
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:09,906
Two out of the three, huh?

75
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,186
What about the other one?

76
00:05:18,346 --> 00:05:19,546
What's wrong?

77
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:24,466
Hey, I came back to see you,
just as I promised.

78
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,866
This time, as a friend.

79
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:32,006
Why has this guy come
to find us in particular?

80
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:33,806
Hey, wait a minute.

81
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:35,168
If you came in
via the building's entrance,

82
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,646
then I should've known.

83
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:39,906
Ah, yes. I made use
of the underground passage.

84
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:43,586
No need to be so on guard.

85
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:46,886
I simply came to be your friend.

86
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:49,426
My friend?

87
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:50,846
Yes.

88
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:55,006
There are so few people
in this world who can understand me.

89
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:56,506
The same goes for those

90
00:05:56,846 --> 00:06:00,546
who can understand you,
or rather, your power, right?

91
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:04,086
Has he already figured out
that I come from another world?

92
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,806
You must've gone through life so confused.

93
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,506
I feel sorry for you.

94
00:06:08,986 --> 00:06:11,326
But your power isn't something to curse.

95
00:06:11,606 --> 00:06:12,946
It's something to be proud of.

96
00:06:13,626 --> 00:06:15,872
Because it's a power
inherited from your mother.

97
00:06:15,872 --> 00:06:18,566
And it's from the same world as mine.

98
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,146
What are you talking about?

99
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:24,026
Your mother, Kanon Shinoyama,

100
00:06:24,286 --> 00:06:27,906
that is the descendant of a family
that possesses the elf eye…

101
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:30,486
Canomuchelin Redrazalf.

102
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:35,246
What did you

103
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:36,886
just say?

104
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:39,566
Polka, what's wrong with you?

105
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:41,466
I'd always wondered

106
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,466
why I was reborn into this body.

107
00:06:45,266 --> 00:06:49,106
I should have more deeply
probed Polka's memories sooner.

108
00:06:50,346 --> 00:06:53,586
This faint memory, deep down.

109
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:57,086
A memory so distant that
it seems in danger of disappearing.

110
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:06,386
The name of the person
I couldn't save in the end.

111
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:11,166
I never thought I would hear
this name in this world.

112
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:15,066
Did you finally get to live out
your last days in peace here?

113
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:16,966
Mother.

114
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:23,386
The one condition decided
at the time my rebirth spell was invoked

115
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:26,752
was that I possess the fresh corpse

116
00:07:26,752 --> 00:07:28,946
of someone of my race.

117
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:33,866
To think that would link me to my mother,
who had somehow come to this world.

118
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:35,286
Polka.

119
00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:37,686
Polka.

120
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:40,226
Did you also see it?

121
00:07:40,706 --> 00:07:45,106
Perhaps mother taught you
all kinds of things too.

122
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:56,766
There's a lot I want to talk to you about.

123
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:02,106
I have to have another
proper face-to-face talk with you.

124
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:05,586
So,

125
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:08,196
give Polka back.

126
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,706
Polka, my friend,
and also my little brother.

127
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,946
Little brother?

128
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:19,066
Was I mistaken?

129
00:08:19,826 --> 00:08:22,886
But his appearance is,
without a doubt, Polka Shinoyama.

130
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:27,046
Is he saying what's on
the inside is different? The soul…

131
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:31,406
That shark?

132
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:35,446
No matter.

133
00:08:36,046 --> 00:08:37,866
The real talk starts now.

134
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:39,626
If you've come the other side of the sky,

135
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:42,006
the other world,

136
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:44,986
and you have something
to do with this mark,

137
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:47,786
then you're affiliated with the empire.

138
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:50,976
So let's join forces

139
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:53,086
and exterminate that bug together.

140
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:54,906
Fire-breathing Bug.

141
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:58,546
Ah, I knew you'd quick
on the uptake. That's good.

142
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:00,826
There's one thing I want to ask you.

143
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:03,886
Do you know Mr. Sabaramond…

144
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:07,166
No, Mr. Arius?

145
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,206
Oh, this is a surprise.

146
00:09:09,486 --> 00:09:11,426
Are you an acquaintance of his?

147
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:13,486
You didn't answer my question.

148
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:17,246
I know of him.

149
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:19,186
But I've never met him.

150
00:09:19,466 --> 00:09:23,106
Because I'm his product.

151
00:09:24,406 --> 00:09:28,326
It seems two of the three
are heading to the building too.

152
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:32,686
Handle them as you please. It's that
woman that you had a scuffle with.

153
00:09:33,146 --> 00:09:34,146
Understood.

154
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,706
I'll ask you plain and simple.

155
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:37,946
Will you join our organization?

156
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:39,646
I must decline.

157
00:09:40,086 --> 00:09:41,306
That was quick.

158
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:44,206
What I want is a peaceful life.

159
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:47,006
I don't know what your goal is,

160
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,646
but your methods clash with mine.

161
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:52,926
I'd rather take Solitaire over you.

162
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,186
Ah, is this because of Habaki?

163
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:59,606
He was acting on his own.

164
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:03,206
Mr. Arius didn't flee from
his responsibilities as a ruler.

165
00:10:04,786 --> 00:10:08,146
Just as I thought. You know Arius well.

166
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,666
Though I have never met him,

167
00:10:11,206 --> 00:10:15,566
but it pisses me off that
you hold him in higher regard than me.

168
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:19,966
Especially since he's the one
who abandoned me in this world.

169
00:10:22,426 --> 00:10:23,386
Abandoned?

170
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:25,666
It appears that
our discussion has come to a halt.

171
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:30,066
I want you to show me your powers.

172
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:33,024
I am even more intrigued by the fact

173
00:10:33,024 --> 00:10:34,466
that you are not Polka Shinoyama.

174
00:10:34,806 --> 00:10:37,726
Fine. All your yapping was a real help.

175
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:43,546
It gave me plenty of time
to invoke my spell.

176
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:50,706
-Those are?
-Bones?

177
00:10:51,366 --> 00:10:52,366
Right!

178
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:55,386
This is no elf summoning
or general sorcery!

179
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:58,906
If the texts from the other world
are correct, then this is…

180
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:00,946
Necromancy!

181
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:02,846
Could it be

182
00:11:02,946 --> 00:11:04,646
Easlies Swordfrail?

183
00:11:05,326 --> 00:11:06,426
No, this is different!

184
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:11,046
There are only three powerful
necromancers by Arius's side.

185
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:15,746
Judging by his attitude
and what he's said so far…

186
00:11:16,846 --> 00:11:17,966
You're…

187
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:19,546
The fourth rank, aren't you?

188
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:24,166
One of the empire's leading
imperial court sorcerers,

189
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,926
Corpse God?

190
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,066
I felt a chill.

191
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,606
Maybe I'm a little too nervous.

192
00:11:30,906 --> 00:11:34,386
For some reason, I feel like I've gotten
involved in something totally huge.

193
00:11:34,906 --> 00:11:38,026
But that just means
I'm close to a big scoop!

194
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:40,546
I can't give up now!

195
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:43,206
Yahoo!

196
00:11:46,146 --> 00:11:48,006
It has…begun.

197
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:51,206
Now, to…settle it.

198
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:56,806
We will…place our will…into that girl.

199
00:11:57,486 --> 00:12:01,166
Then we will arrive…

200
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:04,846
at the bug's nest…

201
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:07,106
Hey.

202
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:10,826
Mind if ask you a couple questions?

203
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:13,026
Mr. Fire-breathing Bug.

204
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:18,456
Where are you heading with those umbrellas

205
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:19,746
on such a clear day?

206
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:21,626
Well, well. Hello, Mr. Detective.

207
00:12:22,546 --> 00:12:23,826
Thanks for the other day.

208
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,146
But putting that aside,

209
00:12:28,286 --> 00:12:31,046
what's the big idea? You suddenly
show up and call me "Fire-breathing Bug."

210
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:33,248
If I remember right, that's the name
of the arsonist who's been

211
00:12:33,248 --> 00:12:35,226
wreaking havoc in town lately, isn't it?

212
00:12:35,786 --> 00:12:36,766
Yes.

213
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,166
But that isn't the name
of a single individual.

214
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,846
By that time that name got around,

215
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:46,146
the ones who originally should
have been called that were no more.

216
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:50,126
A certain somebody kindly left behind
some records that indicate

217
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:54,526
some sort of human experiment
took place in this house.

218
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:58,026
Haigawara Mitsu and Toura Takejirou.

219
00:12:59,486 --> 00:13:01,426
Prisoners of Sabaramond's
human experiments

220
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:05,126
were investigated for homicide.

221
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,906
The two survivors

222
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,166
were the start of you,
Fire-breathing Bug, weren't they?

223
00:13:14,706 --> 00:13:17,966
What you just said is totally lost on me.

224
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:20,206
If you do not have a warrant,

225
00:13:20,206 --> 00:13:21,726
I'm afraid I can't help you.

226
00:13:22,026 --> 00:13:24,106
Well, just let me ask one more thing.

227
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:28,606
A doctor at our station saw those records
and had this to say about them.

228
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:34,006
Perhaps these experiences were meant to
instill a specific pattern of reasoning.

229
00:13:34,426 --> 00:13:35,726
Interesting.

230
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:38,466
Their method combined
unique voices and sound waves

231
00:13:38,606 --> 00:13:42,006
to drill condensed information
into the human brain.

232
00:13:42,326 --> 00:13:46,006
It's a different approach to
body modification than our modern science.

233
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:49,466
That is to say, Fire-breathing Bug
shared between you

234
00:13:49,826 --> 00:13:52,806
is a pseudo-personality
implanted by hypnosis.

235
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:56,226
Even though the original
Fire-breathing Bug is long dead,

236
00:13:56,446 --> 00:14:00,246
that's how they propagated
their personal will into the world.

237
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:01,726
Is it not?

238
00:14:04,126 --> 00:14:05,706
I see.

239
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:09,206
So somebody has finally figured it out.

240
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:11,406
I didn't do it alone.

241
00:14:11,706 --> 00:14:16,246
It was the work of those who came before
me, pursuing various cases over the years.

242
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:19,646
Though it sounds sarcastic
saying that to you guys.

243
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:21,266
Worry not.

244
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:25,546
You are…truly human.

245
00:14:25,726 --> 00:14:30,186
But how…will you prove…our crimes?

246
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:33,886
It'll be hard to explain,
let alone prosecute

247
00:14:33,946 --> 00:14:36,506
you guys for all the arson
you've committed.

248
00:14:36,886 --> 00:14:40,206
Then why…have you…come here?

249
00:14:40,446 --> 00:14:41,906
Even if I can't arrest you,

250
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:46,566
I can at least stop you from committing
future crimes is my thinking.

251
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:49,406
It's the crime of aiding and abetting.

252
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:52,026
You're connected to Solitaire, aren't you?

253
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:56,126
We're the investigation unit assigned
to tracking down Solitaire.

254
00:14:56,506 --> 00:14:59,146
Come on, show me.

255
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:02,046
The power that turns
this world upside down.

256
00:15:09,126 --> 00:15:10,206
What's wrong?

257
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:12,746
Someone's making a hell
of a lot of noise somewhere.

258
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,246
I'll go on ahead, Lulu.

259
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:16,466
O-Okay.

260
00:15:20,146 --> 00:15:23,366
These primitive spells only
unleash his magic in bursts,

261
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:25,506
it's odd he would choose
such basic attacks.

262
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,896
The protection of his
body fortification is no joke.

263
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:29,946
But all of his other spells
are like those of a novice.

264
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:34,046
Necromancer, I really
hit the jackpot with you.

265
00:15:34,386 --> 00:15:37,466
But you say you won't be my friend?

266
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,446
And what you're after is a peaceful life?

267
00:15:40,626 --> 00:15:44,086
Even though you possess such power?
What a sick joke!

268
00:15:44,206 --> 00:15:46,206
That may be so.

269
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:48,346
But I also don't intend to stop.

270
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,526
I won't let you interfere with this world

271
00:15:51,526 --> 00:15:53,966
where my friends
and my little brother live.

272
00:15:57,246 --> 00:16:00,606
That fortune-telling brat is impressive.

273
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:04,426
Now, I have to go all out.

274
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:10,106
Yes.

275
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:13,686
It might be better if you went all
out to deal with that opponent instead.

276
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:18,046
Great. It's another brat.

277
00:16:20,206 --> 00:16:21,486
Lord Civil?

278
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:23,226
Almighty elf!

279
00:16:23,366 --> 00:16:25,506
Please grant your protection
to Lord Civil.

280
00:16:25,626 --> 00:16:26,966
Please, I beg you.

281
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:30,206
A warning from the great elf?

282
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:33,046
I've never received such
a strong warning before.

283
00:16:38,186 --> 00:16:39,826
Found you.

284
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:41,466
Give Polka

285
00:16:42,106 --> 00:16:43,586
back to me.

286
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:46,466
Ah.

287
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,006
Ah, this is fantastic.

288
00:16:49,106 --> 00:16:50,366
You are fantastic.

289
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:52,526
This will only work out
because it was you.

290
00:16:52,946 --> 00:16:55,906
It would be impossible for just
any sorcerer to change the world.

291
00:16:56,326 --> 00:17:00,246
but you alone can revolutionize the world.

292
00:17:00,626 --> 00:17:04,726
Your necromancy is proof
of the existence of the soul.

293
00:17:05,086 --> 00:17:06,646
So many powerful people

294
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:10,246
would rather become zombies
to be immortal?

295
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:12,426
If you make a pact with them,
it'd be possible

296
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:18,206
to recast this boring world
based on a completely new set of values!

297
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:20,926
And even if you don't want that to happen,

298
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:23,506
if you and I join forces,

299
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:27,006
we could bore a hole
to the other side of the sky.

300
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,566
And then we can go home!

301
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,586
Leave this dull world behind.

302
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:32,846
To the world where you and I belong.

303
00:17:34,726 --> 00:17:37,246
Whether you want it or not,

304
00:17:37,686 --> 00:17:39,866
if you won't change the world,

305
00:17:40,046 --> 00:17:42,126
then there's no place for us here.

306
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:45,246
That can't be…

307
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:48,386
His magic is actually starting
to come together.

308
00:17:48,686 --> 00:17:52,226
Thank you for showing me
so much of your power.

309
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:55,066
Thanks to you, I've gotten the hang of it.

310
00:17:55,806 --> 00:17:58,726
Of how to use that magic.

311
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:03,206
He was an amateur at magic until now.

312
00:18:03,446 --> 00:18:05,466
But just by watching my technique?

313
00:18:06,626 --> 00:18:07,686
He's a prodigy.

314
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:10,986
Now, shall we lose the fireworks?

315
00:18:11,106 --> 00:18:14,246
In celebration of our meeting?

316
00:18:18,726 --> 00:18:24,026
They use…fire like…a hundred years ago?

317
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:28,506
Darn…Sabaramond.

318
00:18:36,346 --> 00:18:41,486
So this is the world the sorcerers
from the other side had their sights on.

319
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:46,966
Elemental sorcery that
doesn't make use of the elf.

320
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:50,306
That is a power not found in this world.

321
00:18:50,486 --> 00:18:52,106
Yes!

322
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:55,366
A monster in possession of a power
like this shouldn't be here!

323
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:58,848
You and I should either go back there,

324
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:01,366
or change the world here.

325
00:19:02,146 --> 00:19:04,626
Come on, let's completely
change this world.

326
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:07,806
You already accomplished that once before.

327
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,426
Corpse God.

328
00:19:09,786 --> 00:19:12,326
Or should I call you

329
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,026
"Emperor Killer",

330
00:19:14,106 --> 00:19:16,126
Rizdilusia Redrazalf.

331
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:18,526
So you know about that too.

332
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:23,026
I read the accounts of the Byandy Empire's
main combat force again and again.

333
00:19:23,586 --> 00:19:26,366
I was so enamored by it, my heart danced.

334
00:19:27,186 --> 00:19:29,666
I was born in that world,

335
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:32,926
but the story was like a fairy tale
that I couldn't even touch.

336
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:34,486
Come on.

337
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:37,786
Show me more of the powers
from the other side of the sky!

338
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:43,906
She's gradually adjusting
to my speed and moves!

339
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:45,706
My right hand is my trump card.

340
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:47,776
If I can't put her down in one move,

341
00:19:47,776 --> 00:19:49,186
she'll probably figure out
how to counter it too.

342
00:19:50,726 --> 00:19:53,986
How is it that he knows my go-to moves?

343
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:56,128
I can't believe training with

344
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:57,786
that tiger is paying off here.

345
00:19:58,066 --> 00:19:59,886
Their attack methods are very similar.

346
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:02,306
In fact, I'd say they're totally same.

347
00:20:02,626 --> 00:20:05,326
She's a wild animal
in the body of a human.

348
00:20:05,546 --> 00:20:07,506
That's why I feel like I have
a higher chance of beating her

349
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,546
than I ever did with that tiger!

350
00:20:08,926 --> 00:20:11,126
She's not in the realm of unreasonable.

351
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:15,606
Unreasonable applies
to Agakura Majiri and Lemmin…

352
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:22,286
Great elf? Why?

353
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:27,266
So this is the power of the great elf?

354
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:31,406
Amazing, how should I put it?

355
00:20:31,526 --> 00:20:33,906
The vibe you get when you go in for
the kill or make an attack?

356
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,606
It's still my first time experiencing it.

357
00:20:35,686 --> 00:20:36,986
U-Um…

358
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:40,406
Oh. I'm Misaki. Nice to meet you.

359
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:41,792
Sorry to be so direct,

360
00:20:41,792 --> 00:20:44,866
but would you mind giving back that shark?

361
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:45,566
HOLD TIGHT

362
00:20:45,566 --> 00:20:47,026
No!

363
00:20:47,126 --> 00:20:50,886
Protecting this is
the task I've been given.

364
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,506
Thought so.

365
00:20:53,606 --> 00:20:56,986
Okay. In other words,
unless I get past this,

366
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:00,446
I can't save the real Polka, I guess!

367
00:21:00,846 --> 00:21:03,866
Oh, crap. Can she deal with this?

368
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,826
Can you do anything about this, Polka?

369
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:09,286
-Just as you said.
-Huh?

370
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:14,346
Both you and I are being
incompatible with this world.

371
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:18,266
And it's my fault,
as a foreign entity in this world,

372
00:21:18,686 --> 00:21:21,726
that elf with power
that could destroy the city,

373
00:21:22,046 --> 00:21:24,226
and you, a person who possesses
abilities from another world

374
00:21:24,346 --> 00:21:26,486
were called here.

375
00:21:27,606 --> 00:21:31,786
That being the case, I'll end you here
and return this body to Polka.

376
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:34,866
Once I've gone away somewhere,

377
00:21:35,046 --> 00:21:36,926
the city will return to peace.

378
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:42,546
I don't know what those texts
you read had to say about me,

379
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:45,446
but this place isn't a fairy tale.

380
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:48,326
You will regret you ever met me.

381
00:21:49,706 --> 00:21:51,786
Both the name and the status of Corpse God

382
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:54,606
have fallen to waste already,
along with the country.

383
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:58,866
All that remains is the immortal soul.

384
00:21:59,806 --> 00:22:02,666
I'm used to playing
the enemy of the world.
