NO ENTRY

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,579
Can you explain to me now?

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,494
Before we begin, could you
please ask others to leave?

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,313
They should have all hidden their breath.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,745
Can you see through things?

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,384
I will explain this as well.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,596
Hey, did you guys hear it?

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,112
-But Master…
-Just leave.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,700
There's no one else around,
can you tell me now?

10
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,741
Okay.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,032
You may not believe it when I say this,

12
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,358
but I am not from this world.

00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:20,200
(Episode 7: The Magician)

15
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,744
Good job, Nezu.

16
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,339
Thank you.

17
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,560
What's wrong?

18
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,280
You mean Polka save Kazuki
and the others before you?

19
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,547
Can you tell me more?

20
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,480
I see. Your story does sound unbelievable.

21
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:48,494
But seeing something like this,
I can only believe it.

22
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,004
However,

23
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,147
this also means that

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,170
the person who cut Polka's throat was you,

25
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,755
young girl.

26
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,670
Indeed.

27
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,371
Did you just admit it in front of me?

28
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,600
Are you mentally prepared
to die at my hands?

29
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,700
Or do you think that I am just an old man
who is not worth fearing?

30
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,100
Well, it's a bit of both.

31
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,096
You're a good person, so I'm not afraid.

32
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,856
Even if you want to kill me,
I think there's a reason for it.

33
00:03:29,243 --> 00:03:31,203
WAIT, DON'T KILL HER, FATHER.
Oh, what's this?

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,462
Wait a minute, father. Don't kill Whitey.

35
00:03:40,963 --> 00:03:43,298
Are…Are you polka?

36
00:03:44,383 --> 00:03:45,676
BANG, BANG, BANG

37
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,244
You just said that Polka's
soul is safe and sound.

38
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,159
Doesn't that mean his soul
is sleeping in his own body?

39
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,809
BANG, BANG, SHARK METRONOME

40
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,060
And he happened to possess the doll
of Berg, the shark of hell?

41
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:57,820
COOL, RIGHT?

42
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,113
That's just a temporary solution.

43
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,740
I really admire this child.

44
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,400
And he seems very happy about it,
which is a bit too much.

45
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,719
I can't even get angry anymore.

46
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,183
But surprisingly, there is someone
who thinks I'm a good person.

47
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,938
Young girl, you don't have a good eye
for judging people.

48
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,872
Let's continue our topic.

49
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,840
You just said that
you are the Corpse God, right?

50
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,260
As long as I find a body
for you to possess,

51
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,860
Polka can return to
his original body, right?

52
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,385
How about I let you use this?

53
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,682
It's an artificial human.

54
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,203
There are also similar
studies in my hometown,

55
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,180
but this one is really…

56
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,364
BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG

57
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,741
Why not become a robot
since you need to change your body?

58
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,700
Even if you were given a robot body,
it wouldn't make much sense.

59
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,160
Did you say you want a power drill
and flying skills?

60
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,797
Why do you want to become a rock drill?

61
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,212
Ah, it's not quite appropriate to say
that he seems to be doing well.

62
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,360
But at least he didn't suffer too much.

63
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,260
Anyway, since someone wants to kill Polka,

64
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,807
it's better for you to
continue staying inside him.

65
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,140
-Then…
-Don't misunderstand me.

66
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,080
I didn't intend to forgive
this young girl,

67
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,242
but since you saved my grandson and
granddaughter, I'll let you go for now.

68
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,678
So,

69
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,465
you deliberately didn't mention
the "intermediary" just now.

70
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,480
Since you're in Shinjuku, it's probably
at "Miss Kuraki's" place, right?

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,534
There are several people there
who are quite difficult to deal with.

72
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,920
I really don't want to go against them.

73
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,005
Moreover, I don't want to believe that

74
00:05:47,005 --> 00:05:50,400
someone in the family
would want to kill Polka.

75
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,240
However,

76
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,429
this is probably my retribution.

77
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,840
That's it.

78
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,696
We'll go back after we take a
quick look at real Polka's pet.

79
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,520
You just said that you revealed the truth.
Are you serious?

80
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,775
Yes, but I only told Mr. Rozan the truth.

81
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:07,500
MY TEXTBOOKS…MY GAME CONSOLE…

82
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,585
(MY TEXTBOOKS…MY GAME CONSOLE…)
It's fine as long as you think so.

83
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,329
I have been allowed to
temporarily stay in Shinjuku.

84
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,120
Um…

85
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:19,371
I know I'm not qualified to say
sorry to you anymore at this point.

86
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,788
But I still want to say, I'm sorry.

87
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,107
And thank you.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,799
NOT AT ALL

89
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,542
It's surprising to see

90
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,644
a soul that can be so open-hearted
towards the person who killed them.

91
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,580
It's the first time
I've seen it since then.

92
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,521
Wait, Sis Misaki.

93
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,560
Thank you for saving us.

94
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,940
We were extremely scared just now…

95
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,260
It's okay, it's okay.

96
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,200
A child unafraid of such scenes
would have died.

97
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,780
Sis Misaki, have you learned martial arts?

98
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,311
This is a secret.

99
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,514
Um…Uncle Polka.

100
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,396
Thank you very much.

101
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,520
Thank you.

102
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,095
You shouldn't thank me

103
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,077
because it wasn't me
who saved you just now.

104
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,354
It was a diviner from Shinjuku
called Corpse God

105
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,524
and your guardian spirit.

106
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,780
I can't see that guardian spirit,
but what are you planning to do?

107
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,289
Do you want to make a contract
with that guardian spirit?

108
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,980
Maybe one day.

109
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,167
But not now.

110
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,467
Now is not the right time.

111
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,101
Just now, the sub-bureau received news

112
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,007
that the real Firestarter has appeared.

113
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,352
What a coincidence.

114
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,300
How about the damage?

115
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,789
A police car was burned with an arsonist
who was being transported inside.

116
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,260
It seems that the bug just
burned its own imitator.

117
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,056
Compared to those,

118
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm more interested in
the bones you just mentioned.

119
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,180
If possible, could you show me
the video again?

120
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,618
Then I'm afraid you'll have to exchange it
with the intelligence you know.

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,419
Is that so? Then it's a pity.

122
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,820
Well, I'll go explore it myself then.

123
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,160
Please use this.

124
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,960
You really thought it through.

125
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:38,100
I have learned from the lessons
I had at the club before.

126
00:08:40,554 --> 00:08:42,013
No way!

127
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,112
This guy really exceeded my expectations.

128
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,149
Phantom Solitaire!

129
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,980
So, let's start the comeback
performance of Tena Sorimura.

130
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,600
If there are no audience,

131
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,029
I can only cry alone under the moon.

132
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,900
IT'S JUST WHITE ON THE APPEARANCE…
This is Whitey.

133
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:05,160
IT'S JUST WHITE ON THE APPEARANCE…
It's really big and adorable.

134
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,960
Real Polka is truly
an extraordinary person.

135
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,438
TENA SORIMURA
Phantom Solitaire.

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,757
EMERGENCY MEETING
He escaped from the Tokyo Detention Center

137
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,164
around 5:30 p.m. today.

138
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,340
Excuse me, Team Leader and Mr. Arase,

139
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,320
didn't you go to interrogate
Phantom Solitaire?

140
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,859
Yes! He disappeared when
I and Arase were interrogating him!

141
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,640
I thought someone was
playing a prank on us.

142
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,260
HEHEHE
What is this? It's too funny.

143
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,130
You can still laugh!

144
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,660
For us, this is not something
to be laughed about?

145
00:09:37,152 --> 00:09:39,820
That guy's first crime
was three years ago.

146
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,680
He stole a painting from the art museum
and placed it in front of Shinjuku Alta.

147
00:09:44,361 --> 00:09:46,180
It is said that his motive
for doing so was

148
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,160
to provide material
for online broadcasters.

149
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,880
He then made the Tokyo Metropolitan
Government Building disappear.

150
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:57,005
He painted the sky and buildings on the
outer wall of the building in one night,

151
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,882
creating an optical illusion that made it
appear as if the building had disappeared.

152
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:00,860
This was a trick that
utilized visual deception.

153
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,440
There are many other crimes that
he is suspected of committing,

154
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,300
some of which even involve murder.

155
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,320
However, there is not enough
evidence for this part yet.

156
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,340
Among these cases, there is one that
made him famous all over the world,

157
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,198
that is the kidnapping
of the Prime Minister.

158
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,600
That's right.

159
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,920
It's our Prime Minister Yumenosuke.

160
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,820
One day, he was suddenly covered by
a black cloth from head to toe.

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,180
The bodyguards quickly removed the cloth,

162
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,500
but the Prime Minister
miraculously disappeared.

163
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,420
Dear all, I am a happy offender.

164
00:10:30,747 --> 00:10:33,400
Therefore, I do not have
a specific political stance.

165
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,140
And today, I will prove this point.

166
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,320
So, in order to show his impartiality,
he kidnapped all the leaders

167
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,540
of opposition parties within one day.

168
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,180
NEWS: PRIME MINISTER KIDNAPPING INCIDENT
The prime minister was released in the evening of that day.

169
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,638
THE PRIME MINISTER SAID "IT'S REALLY INTERESTING"
According to his description, he seemed to have

170
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:48,849
come back to his senses and found himself
reading "Bat killer" in a comic cafe.

171
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,460
He even commented,
"It's really interesting."

172
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:56,320
It's unclear if he meant being
kidnapped or the comic.

173
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,760
THIS IS TOO FUNNY.
Even if we try to block the news,

174
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,930
Japan's police system has become
a laughingstock around the world.

175
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,791
Afterwards, that guy came to the
police station and turned himself in.

176
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,137
That guy was definitely
not a normal person.

177
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,056
What brings you here?

178
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,641
There is no reaction,
which I can't accept.

179
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,700
What? The whole society is
discussing you now.

180
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:19,254
I'm not talking about this.

181
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,720
I mean,

182
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,740
I want to use my own magic to
trick the "real one."

183
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:27,260
-Real one?
-But my magic is all about deceiving people with fake tricks.

184
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,920
However, I believe that in this world,

185
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,400
there must exist real magic.

186
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:32,740
My crime is sending messages

187
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,660
to real wizards

188
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,340
and superpowers!

189
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,480
If the "real one" recognizes
me as one of their own

190
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,980
and actively approaches me,

191
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,480
it is proof that in this world,

192
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,260
there really is magic that has no tricks!

193
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,860
What?

194
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,022
Just because of this kind
of juvenile reason,

195
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,920
you caused a big stir throughout Japan?

196
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,540
Everyone has a dreamy
middle school student

197
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,020
hidden in their heart, don't they?

198
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,220
You know what?

199
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,900
I look at the high school students that
my imagination conjures up in my mind

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,960
and can't help but sigh,

201
00:12:08,053 --> 00:12:09,220
"Ah, how free and
pure these children are."

202
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,440
As a responsible adult,

203
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,767
I must work to make
their dreams come true.

204
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,500
Even if I become a sinner and

205
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,980
cause chaos in the world,
I will not hesitate!

206
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,825
I see.

207
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,540
Arrest him.

208
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,154
We can't tell

209
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:29,480
which of his final words were true
and which were made up.

210
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:30,880
SHINJUKU POLICE STATION

211
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:34,980
Although that guy has surpassed ordinary
people in terms of techniques

212
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,300
and action abilities, his most terrifying
aspect is not limited to these.

213
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,636
Not limited to these.

214
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,776
-What is this?
-This is a tool of civilization.

215
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,280
I spent 2 000 yen on it at the

216
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:48,740
CORPSE GOD HAS OBTAINED A RADIO!
second-hand tool store over there.

217
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,860
THE AMOUNT OF CASH HELD DECREASED FROM 20 000 YEN TO 18 000 YEN
I bought this to gather intelligence.

218
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:54,300
With 20 000 yen, you could buy
a cheap tablet instead.

219
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,996
I CAN'T WEAR THIS DRESS ANYMORE

220
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,740
Next up, we will report
the following news.

221
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:03,942
-The sound is very clear.
-There was a police car fire incident this afternoon.

222
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,064
A suspect being escorted in the vehicle
has been confirmed dead.

223
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,059
The suspect was arrested
for suspected arson.

224
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,412
Gender is male, name unknown.

225
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,720
-What?
-Currently,

226
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,340
-the police are intensifying efforts to confirm the identity of the man.
-Seriously?

227
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,158
He is the bastard who burned down
the Shinoyama house back then.

228
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,052
Next up is a brief news.

229
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,620
I wonder if everyone still remembers

230
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,468
the name Tena Sorimura.

231
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,008
25-YEAR VETERAN OF SHINJUKU POLICE STATION, FUMIYO YAMADA
Oh no! Something big has happened.

232
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,460
Tsubaki-chan, come here!

233
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,260
Come over and watch this news.

234
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,680
Who is Tsubaki-chan?

235
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,169
Nickname of the Iwanome leader.

236
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,920
What happened?

237
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,404
Look!

238
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,100
"MAN WHO DISTURBED PUBLIC ORDER" ESCAPES FROM PRISON!!
The news of Phantom Solitaire's escape

239
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,579
"MAN WHO DISTURBED PUBLIC ORDER" ESCAPES FROM PRISON!!
is being broadcast on TV!

240
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,580
-Hasn't the news already been blocked?
-It should be blocked.

241
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,360
This man has kidnapped the Prime Minister
and leaders of various political parties

242
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,180
but released them all within one day.

243
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,569
It was this self-directed and
self-acted sexy man

244
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,560
who quickly brought an end
to this century's major case.

245
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,244
Within the police force,

246
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,579
he has an exclusive nickname,

247
00:13:57,579 --> 00:13:59,640
Phantom Solitaire.

248
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
STRANGE, THIS NEWS IS TOO CASUAL
He personally

249
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,120
IS IT AN ADVERTISEMENT DISGUISED AS NEWS?
accomplished

250
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,860
-what people thought was impossible…
-The person in the news is Phantom Solitaire?

251
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,685
You know him?

252
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,213
Although I have never met him
in person, he is a celebrity.

253
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,985
At least in Japan, he is well-known.

254
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,220
BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT.
Is that so?

255
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,880
After all, you have been the earthbound
spirit here since five years ago.

256
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,474
Just like the Lemmings,
he is also an urban legend in Shinjuku.

257
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,780
However, the reason why
that guy is called a legend

258
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,780
is mainly because he has been
exposed too much in the media.

259
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,440
Speaking of which,
why did the news anchor change?

260
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,908
Which TV station is this?!

261
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,815
VERIFY THE LEGEND OF TENA SORIMURA!!
Are other TV stations showing this scene as well?

262
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,440
For the world, this news can be

263
00:14:37,619 --> 00:14:40,080
seen as either bad or good.

264
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,220
To all viewers in Japan,

265
00:14:42,332 --> 00:14:43,880
as your beloved enemy,

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,300
"THE MAN WHO DISTURBS PUBLIC ORDER" HAS ESCAPED!!
I, Tena Sorimura, am making a comeback!

267
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,620
No, my name now is Phantom Solitaire.

268
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,800
You will witness my return to the world!

269
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,920
Thank you to the police officers
who named me.

270
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,340
As a reward for using this name,
I have prepared a grace period for you.

271
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,400
My next performance will be in one week!

272
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,400
Before that,

273
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,860
please enjoy your life to the fullest,
even if it may seem dull but beautiful!

274
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,400
Adios? Ciao? Neither seems quite right.

275
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,945
LET ME THINK!
Hmm, a farewell greeting.

276
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,615
LET ME THINK!
Let me think carefully before the next farewell comes.

277
00:15:13,988 --> 00:15:15,281
Good night!

278
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,535
WE'RE VERY SORRY.
Uh, we're very sorry for

279
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:20,578
-the visual confusion that just happened.
-He hijacked the communication signal.

280
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,163
He actually has this ability.

281
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,811
No way. The Grocer must have
sold him the broadcasting rights.

282
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,648
Isn't the Grocer still in detention?

283
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
It doesn't matter.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,752
For them, it doesn't matter
where they live.

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,085
Thank you for your patronage.

286
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,880
That's right. This is the terrifying
aspect of Phantom Solitaire.

287
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,500
He and Lisa Kuraki are of the same kind.

288
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,858
They can naturally attract calamities
that have nothing to do with each other

289
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:48,589
to gather around them.

290
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,290
Life is always unpredictable.
I used to think,

291
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,820
"There's no magic in this world," and fell
into despair, locked myself in a cell.

292
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,860
But then new possibilities emerged.

293
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:02,340
Don't you think so?

294
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:04,414
The Firestarter.

295
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,920
But I really didn't expect
that you would respond to my call.

296
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,767
This phone ringtone is really relaxing.

297
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,014
Although I have lost face,
at least I am a magician.

298
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:19,540
I like this music.

299
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,960
However, although it is famous,

300
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,320
many people do not know its title.

301
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,300
UNKNOWN NUMBER CALLING

302
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,203
Sorry, could you wait for me a moment?

303
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,656
Perhaps it's a call from the Grocer
to confirm the delivery with me.

304
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:33,526
Olive Necklace.

305
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:37,460
This is…a well-known piece

306
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,500
played by…Paul Mauriat.

307
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,780
How did you find out this phone number?

308
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,580
Let's put that aside for now.

309
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,849
Is it really necessary to use the phone
when we're so close?

310
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,118
Aren't you just wasting
broadband and call charges?

311
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,377
I really don't want to…

312
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,720
be lectured by…someone who…
wastes their life like you.

313
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,300
How did you…notice my existence?

314
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,760
That's because…

315
00:17:08,853 --> 00:17:12,106
Oh my, are you planning to burn me too?

316
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,909
Just like how that short and pitiful

317
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,365
imposter of yours was burned.

318
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,240
Is he a very skilled criminal?

319
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,060
The Tena Sorimura.

320
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,847
I heard about his name too.

321
00:17:29,207 --> 00:17:31,900
Polka, are there no people like this
in your hometown's world?

322
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,120
A well-known national enemy-like guy.

323
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,520
STICKY WITCH "RADIAL" SEA CLAN MAYOR "DELGA", VAMPIRE NOBLE "SILKA", TRANSPARENT RAMPAGING ANDROID "MEDIEN", ALCHEMIST OF THE FLOATING WORKSHOP "PANI"

324
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,360
If it's something even
someone like me who lives

325
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,480
I'M KIND OF INTERESTED IN SILKA.
deep in the coal mine has heard of,

326
00:17:40,843 --> 00:17:43,972
such as the "King-Killer" who
killed the kingdom of Nyanild,

327
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,146
the poison dragon, Pirawizzo.

328
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,050
I've heard that it fought to a draw with
the man known as the Calamity Crusher

329
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,674
before fleeing the kingdom.

330
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,807
It was only after hearing this news that

331
00:17:53,982 --> 00:17:56,818
I began to entertain thoughts that perhaps
this Calamity Crusher could also kill me.

332
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,001
-Pour son dragon?
-It's a kind of dragon.

333
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,187
It is a creature that is almost
the size of a car in volume,

334
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,040
but can easily kill the
giant Dragon Emperor insect.

335
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,400
As for the Dragon Emperor
insect mentioned earlier,

336
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,180
THIS, PIRAWIZZO
I later made use of it.

337
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,286
Although I am used to
seeing strange things,

338
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,667
your world still has dragons.

339
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,853
Doesn't this world have them?

340
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,940
ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO FANTASY ANIMALS' ECOLOGY
I have seen many stories that mention dragons,

341
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,597
and their shapes are also similar.
I thought there might be some here too.

342
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,660
HMM, WORTH PONDERING.

343
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,660
THE CREATURES IN THE WORLD OF POLKA AND THE IMAGINARY CREATURES IN OUR WORLD.

344
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,560
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO MAKE A THOROUGH COMPARISON.

345
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:31,519
Yes, maybe there are other
commonalities to be discovered.

346
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,981
And it seems that there are
also spirits of wind and fire.

347
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:35,920
SPIRIT ELEMENTAL, FIRE DRAGON, SERAPHINE

348
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:41,529
You're really amazing,
just like a fire spirit.

349
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:43,900
Geez.

350
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,028
Can't you just listen to me for a moment?

351
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,914
What do you… want to say?

352
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,720
What to say?

353
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,820
Do I even need to answer that question?

354
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,906
Of course is nonsense.

355
00:19:03,593 --> 00:19:07,160
Earlier, I questioned you about
why you would waste phone charges,

356
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:09,432
but that doesn't mean I'm denying you!

357
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,080
As a matter of fact,

358
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,770
I am someone who enjoys
the concept of "waste" the most!

359
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,648
The secret to enjoying life lies in
whether or not we can enjoy these wastes—

360
00:19:18,066 --> 00:19:19,980
wasting time, effort,

361
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,778
and money.

362
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,620
And if we eliminate waste altogether,

363
00:19:26,824 --> 00:19:30,161
all that will be left in our lives
is breathing, eating, and sleeping.

364
00:19:30,161 --> 00:19:32,240
And in this way, we will be
no different from machines.

365
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:34,040
Because if just being alive is enough,

366
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,750
then aren't human emotions

367
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,252
also a kind of waste?

368
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,720
This is…your…sophistry.

369
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,604
I am…unable to…communicate with you.

370
00:19:46,427 --> 00:19:49,220
People will experience happiness and pain

371
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:53,160
as long as…they live…in this world.

372
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,271
Emotion is…not a defect…

373
00:19:58,106 --> 00:20:02,180
it's a part…of life…

374
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,238
You're right! Anyway,
let me praise you first.

375
00:20:07,323 --> 00:20:09,140
I don't have the answer myself

376
00:20:09,325 --> 00:20:11,285
and I've never thought
about the meaning of life!

377
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,440
Is it sophistry? Not really!

378
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:15,120
I'm just playing a word game.

379
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,900
But you're correct about
being unable to communicate!

380
00:20:18,334 --> 00:20:20,520
I just wanted to say some serious words

381
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,200
and then try to get away with it smoothly.

382
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,965
I never expected you would see through me!

383
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,928
Isn't it incredible?

384
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:31,973
Do you feel no weight at all?

385
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:34,308
But this is just a magic trick,

386
00:20:34,725 --> 00:20:36,060
a deceptive illusion,

387
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,283
like your fire.

388
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,241
Your power is not magic or superpower.
This makes me feel extremely regretful.

389
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:47,000
I am not interested in… fairy tales…

390
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,360
But what if one day
fairy tales became reality?

391
00:20:51,993 --> 00:20:54,040
In this world that you consider abnormal,

392
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,500
what if there really is
an alien intrusion?

393
00:20:58,082 --> 00:20:59,980
The "thing" that appeared in Shinjuku,

394
00:21:00,084 --> 00:21:03,087
do you consider it a "defect"
that should be eliminated?

395
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,484
Don't you want to personally find out?

396
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,060
If my judgment is that they are
"pests that should be burned,"

397
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,094
what do you plan to do?

398
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,660
Let's think about that
when the time comes.

399
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:17,300
You are too obsessed…
with supernatural phenomena.

400
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,900
Didn't I tell you before?

401
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,280
I love waste the most.

402
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,660
However, when it comes to dragons,

403
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,432
their name alone makes them a national
enemy due to their destructive power.

404
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,580
But compared to these creatures,

405
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,160
our criminals here
don't seem that terrifying.

406
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,820
However, it's not entirely
accurate to say that.

407
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,840
In this world, magic doesn't exist,

408
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,012
so the premises of
the two are completely different.

409
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:42,740
Moreover, the Lemmings

410
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:45,338
is also a very dangerous presence
in my hometown.

411
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,104
Could it be the Lemmings?

412
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:54,760
STUFFED

413
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,160
Good evening.

414
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,441
How are you, Polka?

415
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:02,740
Huh?

416
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,619
