1
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:04,631
Like cards,
all people have a front and a back.

2
00:00:05,151 --> 00:00:07,511
Sometimes they intentionally
conceal the facts.

3
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:09,591
Sometimes they don't.

4
00:00:10,451 --> 00:00:14,551
And the same card will change
its patterns each time you turn it over.

5
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:16,291
And,

6
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:18,011
once in a while,

7
00:00:18,671 --> 00:00:23,331
there are those whose front
and back sides are both wicked.

8
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:29,351
Those cards curiously enough,
tend to gather in the same hand.

(Dead Mount, Death Play)

10
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,936
(Episode 16: The Fake)

11
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:05,536
Don't move around.

12
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:09,096
O-okay, thanks.

13
00:02:09,656 --> 00:02:12,996
Are you really Heilei--

14
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:17,316
There's plenty that I want to ask too,

15
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:20,936
but we will talk later.

16
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:32,276
Those extensions are your fingers?

17
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:37,456
Don't overdo it, boy.

18
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:39,436
Your legs are shaking.

19
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:42,156
Hey.

20
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:44,576
And what's with those hands
and feet anyway?

21
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:49,076
The ones that my oldest sister cut off

22
00:02:49,476 --> 00:02:52,656
should still be in the collection room.

23
00:02:52,796 --> 00:02:57,036
Oh well. I don't know if you're hoping
to get revenge on her or what,

24
00:02:57,396 --> 00:03:00,416
but I already know
all about the Heilei's tricks.

25
00:03:01,736 --> 00:03:03,096
Don't get the wrong idea.

26
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:05,856
I'm not a Heilei anymore.

27
00:03:06,556 --> 00:03:09,236
And you think this shaking is from fear?

28
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:11,976
Are you shaking with excitement?

29
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,276
No.

30
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:16,256
It's a beast's warning growl.

31
00:03:32,256 --> 00:03:33,816
I see!

32
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:38,576
What a blast!

33
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:41,956
This isn't Heilei's moves at all.

34
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:51,416
But

35
00:03:51,736 --> 00:03:56,276
your luck and your way of trying
to confuse your opponent are still Heilei.

36
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:01,076
Game over.

37
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:04,036
What a pity.

38
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:07,636
You were so close just now.

39
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:12,136
The way you're going after Mr. Higuro
here is so the Heilei way.

40
00:04:12,576 --> 00:04:17,656
Looks like you didn't manage to escape
from the Heilei's karma.

41
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:18,796
Hehehe.

42
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:19,976
Mr. Momoya!

43
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,196
Misaki!

44
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:30,896
Miss Sakimiya?

45
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:32,516
Hehehe.

46
00:04:32,516 --> 00:04:34,676
I had a hunch.

47
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:36,416
You're on our side

48
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,436
after all, aren't you, Xiaoyu?

49
00:04:39,176 --> 00:04:41,496
Put me down!

50
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:44,516
What is going on?

51
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:47,976
Wasn't she killed by Momoya?

52
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:51,336
Is this something
that bends the laws of nature?

53
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:54,176
In addition to mission instructions,

54
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:57,716
our superiors told us to report anything
that appeared to violate nature's laws.

55
00:04:58,176 --> 00:05:01,096
I did not expect to see it
with my own eyes, though.

56
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,676
But before that…

57
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,096
Can I get out

58
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:09,456
of this alive?

59
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:13,156
Okay, okay.

60
00:05:13,336 --> 00:05:15,356
It doesn't make any sense,

61
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,576
but I think I've got the picture.

62
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:20,036
The girl I supposedly killed is alive.

63
00:05:20,036 --> 00:05:22,756
And she's even stronger than before.

64
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:24,376
Talk about creepy, huh?

65
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,076
It causes people's skin to crawl.

66
00:05:26,376 --> 00:05:28,376
It's the end of the world.

67
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:31,196
But it's quite interesting.

68
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:33,936
Now then, should we get started?

69
00:05:36,776 --> 00:05:38,716
Very interesting.

70
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:42,096
Let's all play our trump cards.

71
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:45,496
Hehehe! What beautiful long legs!

72
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,736
They're like a model's!

73
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:50,136
Are you trying to seduce me?

74
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:54,056
Oh, my sisters always tell me,

75
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:59,876
"You are weak, so seduce
your opponent to confuse them."

76
00:06:03,916 --> 00:06:04,796
He's fast.

77
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:06,176
But wait.

78
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:07,756
He barely moved.

79
00:06:22,056 --> 00:06:23,956
Miss Sakimiya's able to keep up with him.

80
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:36,396
That was close!

81
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:38,296
I barely dodged that!

82
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,696
So what should we do, Xiaoyu?

83
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:41,496
Huh?

84
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:43,656
Should we take him on together?

85
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:47,856
Or are you the type who finds it
cooler to fight one-on-one?

86
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:50,276
I'm fine with either!

87
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,836
Strange. I'm confused.

88
00:06:55,176 --> 00:06:58,696
I could've sworn I timed
my attack perfectly to cut you.

89
00:07:00,136 --> 00:07:01,716
What could have happened?

90
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:04,136
I've been wondering for a while.

91
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,736
Why is it

92
00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:08,036
I'm not hearing Miss Sakimiya's heartbeat?

93
00:07:10,256 --> 00:07:11,136
So to speak,

94
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:15,936
is Misaki currently a vampire?

95
00:07:16,076 --> 00:07:16,936
Yes.

96
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,116
You could say she is close to a vampire.

97
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:22,596
By interfering with the connection
between body and soul via necromancy,

98
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,636
her body functions similarly
to that of a vampire.

99
00:07:26,136 --> 00:07:26,996
So,

100
00:07:27,076 --> 00:07:30,716
the current Misaki has
augmented regenerative power

101
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:31,816
and can…

102
00:07:32,456 --> 00:07:33,316
Whoa.

103
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:35,116
And can transform her body into a bat.

104
00:07:43,116 --> 00:07:44,056
This guy!

105
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:50,536
His footwork and the positioning
of his long legs confuse his opponent.

106
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:53,036
What a seduction.

107
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:56,036
Even the color of his jacket.
It's all been calculated to

108
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:59,636
give the illusion
that he is tall and large.

109
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:01,716
Are you up?

110
00:08:01,716 --> 00:08:04,156
What're you going to show me next?

111
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:09,056
Then, let me mimic

112
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,976
your long arm from earlier.

113
00:08:11,036 --> 00:08:13,796
Are you going to throw that crowbar?

114
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:18,556
No tricks.

115
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24,416
What the heck is this?

116
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:26,076
Hey, hey.

117
00:08:26,176 --> 00:08:27,796
She's not trying to hide it at all.

118
00:08:31,256 --> 00:08:32,516
Too bad,

119
00:08:32,936 --> 00:08:35,456
I couldn't cut you in half.

120
00:08:35,976 --> 00:08:38,456
There was no centrifugal force
involved in that throw.

121
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:41,376
That thing cut into me of its own will.

122
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:45,976
Are you an apprentice of Solitaire?

123
00:08:47,076 --> 00:08:49,516
Shouldn't we explain

124
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:53,616
the situation to Xiaoyu?

125
00:08:53,896 --> 00:08:55,096
Yes.

126
00:08:55,436 --> 00:08:58,176
I'll fill him in as soon as he gets back.

127
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:01,996
What's wrong, Mr. Hosorogi?

128
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:11,296
I NEED YOUR HELP WITH SOMETHING

129
00:09:11,936 --> 00:09:15,656
We're playing at a table
that's already full of bad cards.

130
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:19,076
You cannot win
by counting on the joker alone.

131
00:09:19,336 --> 00:09:22,496
Whoever holds the stronger trump card
in this situation will win.

132
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:28,196
It's time for the players holding the cards to
scrutinize each other's poker faces, don't you think?

133
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:33,756
INCOMING CALL, UNKNOWN NUMBER
Who is this?

134
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:35,896
Hello.

135
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,856
I can't believe I got through.

136
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:41,696
Who is this?

137
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:44,196
You're too easy to manipulate.

138
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:48,216
Didn't I say you should regularly
change your phone and number?

139
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:51,076
You are…

140
00:09:53,096 --> 00:09:54,196
Mr.

141
00:09:54,796 --> 00:09:55,756
Hosorogi?

142
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:05,135
I wonder if the Shinoyama family
has any connection to that building.

143
00:10:05,295 --> 00:10:06,275
Let's see.

144
00:10:06,535 --> 00:10:08,755
The building is owned by Lisa Kuraki.

145
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,935
The granddaughter of
the industrialist Luis Kuraki.

146
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,955
After coming into her inheritance following
the disappearance of her parents,

147
00:10:15,095 --> 00:10:18,515
she was the victim of
a kidnapping as a high schooler.

148
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:19,855
Huh?

149
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:21,795
But that kidnapping incident

150
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:23,104
was resolved by the police officer

151
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:25,575
INSPECTOR, MIYABI HOSOROGI
who disappeared in the building.

152
00:10:26,615 --> 00:10:27,635
Mr. Hosorogi?

153
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:30,275
Is that really you, Mr. Hosorogi?

154
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:31,815
Calm down.

155
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:34,155
Don't go shouting my name.

156
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,095
Wouldn't want someone overhearing you.

157
00:10:43,635 --> 00:10:46,555
Is it really you?

158
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:49,735
I can't properly speak on my own anymore.

159
00:10:50,095 --> 00:10:53,155
Or, I suppose, it's more accurate to say
that I've been deprived of speech.

160
00:10:53,255 --> 00:10:54,255
Where are you now?

161
00:10:54,475 --> 00:10:56,275
Can't I see you in person?

162
00:10:56,575 --> 00:10:58,335
You're smart.

163
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:01,115
You must already know that's impossible.

164
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,425
BORROWED VOCAL CORDS OF A DIED PIGEON
But I doubt you'd be

165
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:07,015
WITH THE PERMISSION OF HOSOROGI'S SOUL
able to fully grasp my current situation.

166
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:08,895
This appearance is overly dramatic.

167
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,395
Sure, I don't get it at all!

168
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:14,075
The old you would have never involved

169
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:16,075
a high schooler to pull a stunt like that!

170
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:18,515
You mean Polka Shinoyama?

171
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:21,315
The old me is dead.

172
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:26,015
I'm not the Miyabi Hosorogi you once knew.

173
00:11:26,255 --> 00:11:29,175
The craziest part is,
he's telling the truth.

174
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:33,355
We are facing many enemies.

175
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:36,915
Do you still carry that note?

176
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:37,975
Yes.

177
00:11:38,435 --> 00:11:39,555
DON'T HOLD ONTO THE PAST. SELECT WHAT YOU ENJOY
I left a number of clues

178
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,475
NO ONE CAN BE TRUSTED
on that note.

179
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:42,895
ON THE WEST SIDE OF THAT PLACE, THERE'S ONE MORE GARAGE
But I don't have time

180
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:44,055
THERE'S A SIGNPOST, THE KEY IS BEHIND 1-383 MIRROR
to tell you everything.

181
00:11:44,755 --> 00:11:47,475
I'll just tell you the basics.

182
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:51,155
Clarissa's going to be involved again.

183
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,755
If the enemy is on the move again,

184
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:57,475
we will make preparations
to intercept them too.

185
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,195
Clarissa?

186
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,515
You do realize she's a criminal, right?

187
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,755
That's that. This is this.

188
00:12:04,435 --> 00:12:06,095
I don't expect you to believe everything.

189
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:09,135
We'll save that conversation
for next time.

190
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:11,395
Okay.

191
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:13,975
Let's have a good, long talk later.

192
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:17,515
Well, what is it I should know?

193
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:21,475
Actually, I want to tell you that

194
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:25,595
the suspect was rooted
in the police department.

195
00:12:29,735 --> 00:12:32,215
This isn't funny.

196
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,555
So?

197
00:12:34,695 --> 00:12:36,615
These "players" you speak of…

198
00:12:36,615 --> 00:12:38,915
In other words, you're saying
I'm the mastermind?

199
00:12:39,215 --> 00:12:44,235
I believe your position as a superintendent
general qualifies you as a player.

200
00:12:45,435 --> 00:12:50,095
The superintendent general is just one of
the authorities responsible for the scene.

201
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:55,235
It's the National Police Agency
manages the organization.

202
00:12:55,615 --> 00:12:58,075
I should say it's the prime minister along

203
00:12:58,175 --> 00:13:01,355
with the National Public Safety Commission
above that who are at the top.

204
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:06,855
Going further, in light of popular sovereignty,
it's the citizens who supersede the prime minister.

205
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,995
That's not what I'm talking about…

206
00:13:10,355 --> 00:13:15,115
Then the "players" you speak of
could refer to each and every citizen.

207
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,275
Hmm…

208
00:13:16,975 --> 00:13:22,035
Everybody's a player, a pawn and a cog.

209
00:13:22,895 --> 00:13:28,135
Just like when you made PM Kubikigawara a
pawn for your own attention-seeking needs.

210
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:30,735
Heh. That brings back memories.

211
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:36,055
The sarcastic thing I said
did not mean to make you angry.

212
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:40,115
Do you want to scare me with words?

213
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:44,975
In any case, you're implying
I'm the mastermind behind "something"?

214
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:48,035
Then why did you show yourself to me?

215
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:50,175
Just what is it you want?

216
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:53,275
Heh-heh. You don't get it, do you?

217
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:54,675
That's right.

218
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:56,895
You can't figure out my plans,

219
00:13:56,975 --> 00:13:58,595
Mr. Superintendent General.

220
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:00,295
Can you even imagine?

221
00:14:00,895 --> 00:14:05,295
I have no plan for what comes next!

222
00:14:06,015 --> 00:14:08,655
The mystery person
who ordered to assassinate me

223
00:14:08,855 --> 00:14:11,705
I'M A STAND-IN
must be someone in a high position.

224
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:14,055
I'M A STAND-IN
I only came to see what I can get from him.

225
00:14:15,615 --> 00:14:16,735
CURRENT RESULT: HE'S PISSED OFF
What should I do next?

226
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:21,995
Do you have any plans next?

227
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:24,915
That trick of extending an arm?

228
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:27,215
I don't think that's going to work again.

229
00:14:28,515 --> 00:14:29,855
You're probably right.

230
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:32,075
That guy's a tough one.

231
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,195
Huh?

232
00:14:38,495 --> 00:14:40,775
But will this work?

233
00:14:41,595 --> 00:14:43,615
Trust me.

234
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:46,615
Don't blame me if you die.

235
00:14:46,855 --> 00:14:50,875
Wow! Are you worried about me?
This is very kind of you.

236
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:55,015
You done with your team meeting?

237
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,995
Yes! Thanks for waiting.

238
00:14:57,995 --> 00:14:59,815
No need to thank me.

239
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:02,395
I wanted some time too.

240
00:15:02,395 --> 00:15:05,555
A moment to think
about that little trick of yours

241
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:08,035
and to prepare myself.

242
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:14,795
I knew it, the fabric's been cut.

243
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:17,635
So my blade did land.

244
00:15:38,555 --> 00:15:40,135
Got you!

245
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,915
Got you!

246
00:15:55,595 --> 00:15:57,475
Am I dreaming?

247
00:15:58,015 --> 00:15:59,035
I…

248
00:15:59,755 --> 00:16:00,575
Oh well.

249
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,135
It's fine.

250
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:09,935
Did they do it?

251
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:11,675
They seriously beat one of the Agakura?

252
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:13,435
Is this real?

253
00:16:13,795 --> 00:16:15,035
We did it.

254
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:16,535
But…

255
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:19,835
What happened just now?

256
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,555
When he's got ahold of me,

257
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:25,075
you can stab me right through.

258
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:28,255
It was too dark to see clearly.

259
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,295
The shadows and flapping
coming from Miss Misak

260
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:34,295
looked and sounded exactly like bats.

261
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:35,795
We did it!

262
00:16:39,055 --> 00:16:41,035
Watch out! Higuro still has a gun!

263
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:44,155
Ah, that person has already escaped.

264
00:16:45,995 --> 00:16:47,075
What?

265
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:50,075
Phew, I'm safe.

266
00:16:50,615 --> 00:16:52,215
I knew I could count on Mr. Momoya.

267
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:55,295
I really appreciate him going berserk

268
00:16:55,575 --> 00:16:56,875
to keep everyone's eyes on him.

269
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:59,695
If he beats those two,

270
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:02,275
I hope we get to work together again.

271
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:03,855
If he loses,

272
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:06,075
I can only mourn for him.

273
00:17:06,675 --> 00:17:08,915
I won't let your sacrifice go to waste.

274
00:17:10,575 --> 00:17:11,655
So,

275
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,935
I'll report what I just saw,
things that bend the law of nature,

276
00:17:15,475 --> 00:17:16,915
METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT
to the superiors.

277
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:19,200
INCOMING CALL, UNKNOWN NUMBER

278
00:17:23,295 --> 00:17:24,535
Not going to answer that?

279
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:28,055
It's just a personal call.
And I'm still on the job.

280
00:17:28,695 --> 00:17:30,175
I see.

281
00:17:31,955 --> 00:17:33,735
Are you saying your "suspects"

282
00:17:33,875 --> 00:17:36,695
include people I've been
close to for years?

283
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:40,315
I only wish this were just a joke.

284
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:41,935
But Tsubaki,

285
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:45,795
once you've joined the police,
the entire organization is close to you.

286
00:17:46,335 --> 00:17:48,975
From the faceless resident officers

287
00:17:49,175 --> 00:17:51,295
to the partner you've been
assigned to for years.

288
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:55,755
The moment you suspect the police,
there's no difference between them.

289
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,215
You've convinced me.

290
00:17:59,255 --> 00:18:01,735
You really are the same.

291
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:04,535
You want me to think of you as dead?

292
00:18:04,855 --> 00:18:05,875
Not possible.

293
00:18:06,035 --> 00:18:08,235
You will always live in our hearts.

294
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:12,215
I won't let you wiped out
easily from my heart.

295
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:14,635
Whatever you want.

296
00:18:14,775 --> 00:18:17,055
I'm hanging up now. I'll be in touch.

297
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,375
Senior, I have one last question.

298
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:25,415
Do you think I'm the spy
for the mastermind you mentioned?

299
00:18:25,635 --> 00:18:27,715
Have you forgotten what I'm like?

300
00:18:28,235 --> 00:18:32,395
If it ever came to that, I'd put
a bullet right between your eyes.

301
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:33,775
Fair enough.

302
00:18:35,395 --> 00:18:37,575
UNKNOWN NUMBER, CALL ENDED
I can't call him back with his unknown number.

303
00:18:38,155 --> 00:18:42,015
Shall I issue a warrant
and get his number released?

304
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:43,635
If you do that,

305
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:45,875
it'll out the whole thing to the traitors.

306
00:18:46,515 --> 00:18:47,815
I'm relieved then.

307
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:49,535
You're still the manager I know.

308
00:18:50,415 --> 00:18:51,355
Yeah.

309
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:53,855
If anything,
I feel like I've got my old spirit back.

310
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:57,275
UNKNOWN NUMBER, INCOMING CALL
Is it Mr. Hosorogi again?

311
00:18:57,735 --> 00:18:59,295
Maybe he forgot to say something?

312
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,255
Question.

313
00:19:01,395 --> 00:19:04,555
I've finished the job. Who am I?

314
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:05,235
Huh?

315
00:19:05,315 --> 00:19:06,315
First clue.

316
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:08,975
My real name is Tena Sorimura.

317
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:10,755
Solitaire?

318
00:19:10,955 --> 00:19:11,955
That's correct!

319
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:15,395
You must be very smart to

320
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:17,935
have figured that out after just one clue!

321
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:20,975
As your reward, I'll throw you a "bone"!

322
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:22,855
Quit joking around.

323
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:28,995
It's about the mastermind you were
just speaking with Prosecutor Hosorogi.

324
00:19:29,095 --> 00:19:30,455
Don't you want some hard evidence?

325
00:19:31,715 --> 00:19:36,795
When you make bold moves, you end up
with some unexpected gains, you know?

326
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:39,635
Yes, just like me.

327
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:43,595
I'm sorry for causing trouble for you all.

328
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,935
I didn't want to involve you two.

329
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:50,755
But once they came here,
I was left with no choice.

330
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:52,635
This Iwanome person

331
00:19:52,795 --> 00:19:56,415
was probably over the moon
thinking you're still alive.

332
00:19:57,255 --> 00:19:59,635
But you're so cruel.

333
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:02,095
I'm well aware.

334
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:04,915
I'd always believed
there was no decent way to die.

335
00:20:05,175 --> 00:20:07,055
But that's exactly how it's turned out.

336
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:10,575
But right now,
everything is going as planned for me.

337
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:13,995
I hope Iwanome does an excellent job.

338
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,315
Mr. Hosorogi aside,

339
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,895
do you believe what Solitaire said?

340
00:20:19,115 --> 00:20:22,055
Not one damn word of it.

341
00:20:22,475 --> 00:20:23,915
But I told you before.

342
00:20:24,175 --> 00:20:25,815
"Whatever a person says…"

343
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:30,135
"It has a meaning,
whether or not it's true."

344
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:32,855
That's just something
I picked up from Hosorogi.

345
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:38,675
This is urgent. Seriously, please pick up.

346
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:43,995
Shouldn't you pick up?

347
00:20:46,115 --> 00:20:47,635
Sorry, I'll only be a minute.

348
00:20:57,595 --> 00:20:59,715
No calling me during work.

349
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:01,635
Didn't I tell you that already?

350
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:04,155
I have some information
that's a top priority.

351
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:06,615
It's the high school girl
who was in that building.

352
00:21:06,855 --> 00:21:09,895
Even though I killed her,
she came right back to life.

353
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:13,975
She "bends the laws of nature."

354
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:17,375
Also, I had a tussle
with the Shinoyama in the process.

355
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:19,035
I need to hide for a while.

356
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,755
Can I ask you to protect me from
the Shinoyama family's threat?

357
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:24,775
Don't worry.

358
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,095
You'll be fine.

359
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:34,395
As long as you're still
under the protection of Sabaramond.

360
00:21:35,055 --> 00:21:36,955
Good work, Higuro.

361
00:21:44,915 --> 00:21:46,035
You…

362
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:47,715
You!

363
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:51,415
I can't be speaking on the phone
to a journalist in the headquarters!

364
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:54,975
I just wanted to tell you something, Bro!

365
00:21:54,975 --> 00:21:56,608
REAL NAME: KOCHOU YATSU
YATSU = EIGHT PORT

366
00:21:57,555 --> 00:21:59,595
After the death of Mr. Hosorogi,

367
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:02,675
only one officer received
a suspicious promotion.

368
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,695
To be honest, I'm quite shocked.

369
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:07,715
I never imagined that the person who
helped me when I was about to be fired,

370
00:22:08,315 --> 00:22:11,715
someone I considered family,
would betray me.

371
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:14,735
I made the same mistake just now.

372
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:18,015
You were so careless to say the name
of your contact over the phone like that.

373
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:20,435
Inspector Habaki.

374
00:22:25,515 --> 00:22:28,555
That man there isn't moving.
What do we do with him?

375
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:31,055
We probably shouldn't mess with him.

376
00:22:32,495 --> 00:22:33,395
But

377
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:36,275
does this mean that it's over?

378
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,575
Are you kidding me?

379
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:40,755
There is no way Mr. Habaki…

380
00:22:41,155 --> 00:22:42,135
-Listen.
-Small carp fish…

381
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:44,035
Don't tell Mr. Iwa about this.

382
00:22:44,035 --> 00:22:45,475
The fisherman

383
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:48,755
fished in the river.

384
00:22:50,415 --> 00:22:52,575
Those dreams

385
00:22:52,735 --> 00:22:54,675
even now

386
00:22:55,055 --> 00:22:59,075
return to me.

387
00:22:59,715 --> 00:23:04,095
How I miss

388
00:23:04,335 --> 00:23:07,375
my hometown.

389
00:23:16,335 --> 00:23:20,255
The number you have dialed is powered off

390
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:22,635
or out of service.

391
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,535
Please try again later.

392
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:27,035
He deserves to be punished.

393
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:29,215
Momo, how dare you

394
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:33,135
ignore such an important
phone call from your dear sister?

395
