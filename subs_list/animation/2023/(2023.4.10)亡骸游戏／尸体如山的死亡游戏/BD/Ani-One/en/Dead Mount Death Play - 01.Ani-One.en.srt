1
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,430
Injured individuals,
go and find the sorcerer!

2
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,920
Others, step back!

3
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,300
He, as the main force
of the subjugation unit,

4
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,600
is about to arrive!

5
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,140
He is the hidden ace of the church.

6
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,520
He has conquered countless obstacles

7
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,080
and experienced many battles.

8
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,440
He's the Calamity Crusher,

9
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,480
Shagrua Edith Lugrid!

10
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,620
This maze

11
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,820
is still expanding.

12
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,920
The crazed undead summoned

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
so many dead bodies

14
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,620
that they even overflowed out of the maze.

15
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,480
It is the rare necromancer,

16
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,660
known as the Corpse God!

17
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,800
(Dead Mount, Dead Play)

18
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,940
Oh, God.

19
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,660
This is such a powerful magic.

20
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,900
If we cannot defeat it here,

21
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,960
the world will be devoured
by tide of the undead.

22
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,270
However,

23
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,740
can Sir Shagrua, who bears
the name of Calamity Crusher,

24
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,220
really defeat it?

25
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,040
He can definitely make it.

26
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,980
Sir Shagrua will never lose.

27
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,760
He will

28
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,920
never

29
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,180
surrender to death.

30
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,260
I was killed by you.

31
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,180
We were all killed by you.

32
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,330
Why are you the only one who survived?

33
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,940
Go die.

34
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,420
Go die and suffer the torment.

35
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,580
Struggle desperately and cry in pain.

36
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,200
Let out endless screams of sorrow.

37
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,300
I was able to see the souls

38
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,620
of those whose lives you had taken.

39
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,360
You possess the Evil Eye?

40
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,420
Evil Eye?

41
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,480
Those who possess the Evil Eye

42
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,180
are able to see spirits.

43
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,020
No matter if it's a robber or

44
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,880
a monster killed by oneself,

45
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,280
or even

46
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,280
a bird or insect strangled to death,
none can escape the Evil Eye possessor.

47
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,340
Therefore, most Evil Eye possessors

48
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,960
would hide in the church
to spend their lives.

49
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,340
Yet some would be immersed
in the pleasure of manipulating souls

50
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,940
and become necromancers

51
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,680
like the Corpse God.

52
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,020
But Sir Shagrua chose to step

53
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,420
onto the battlefield

54
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,160
and fought bravely for us.

55
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,140
That is

56
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,980
your true form?

57
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,380
Is everything you do
just for this little thing?

58
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,640
All life is nothing but a toy to me.

59
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,840
Are you regarding yourself as a death god?

60
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,060
The gods do not play games.

61
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,420
Just like you and me
who possess the Evil Eye.

62
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,340
You actually enjoy it, don't you?

63
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,460
You enjoy the sorrowful cries
filled with resentment

64
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,620
from the souls you have killed.

65
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,500
Don't confuse me with you.

66
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,460
You monster who is not worth pitying!

67
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,700
You and I are futilely fighting to death,

68
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,120
but we are just wearing
the skin of the Grim Reaper,

69
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,160
and building a mountain of corpses here.

70
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,800
At the end of the day,
we are just playing house.

71
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,160
This pattern

72
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,300
is a magic that I have never seen before.

73
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,220
Let's put an end to this.

74
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,760
Our game ends here.

75
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,180
You won't succeed.

76
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,720
As long as you still exist,

77
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,620
there would be no future

78
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,680
for this country

79
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,980
and the children.

80
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,070
Let me help you.

81
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,660
Sir Shagrua!

82
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,000
My memory is a bit fuzzy.

83
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,530
By the way,

84
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,780
was my magic activated back then?

85
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,860
What is this place?

86
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,720
My body can still move.

87
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,800
What's the matter with these slender arms?

88
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
Why can't I make any sound?

89
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,200
The floor and walls are a bit strange.

90
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,120
What is going on here? This street…

91
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,120
Hey! Hey!

92
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,780
Wait a moment.

93
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,900
Darn. Seriously?

94
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,400
My head broke down,

95
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,720
didn't it?

96
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,600
It's me. Stop the disposal operation.

97
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,480
The body in the alley is gone now.

98
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,780
More precisely, he is still alive.

99
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
What exactly is going on?

100
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,160
Was it that she didn't make it?

101
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,900
No way. I've checked it.

102
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,040
Anyway, don't take any action for now.

103
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,930
Why can that guy

104
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,900
still walk normally

105
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,320
even when his throat is cut open?

106
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,440
It's simply inexplicable.

107
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,620
All of them are architectural styles
that I have never seen before.

108
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,880
The characters I have never seen before.

109
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,460
Is that

110
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,540
a projection technique?

111
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,200
But I didn't sense any magic.

112
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,720
What place is this exactly?

113
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,540
SHINJUKU STATION

114
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,660
By the way, there are
really a lot of people here.

115
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,840
The kids look great.

116
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,900
They are laughing happily.

117
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,720
This must be a place
where life is peaceful.

118
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,040
What happened to that country later?

119
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Although I don't know if I can go back,

120
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,320
I hope that country
can at least have a future.

121
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,740
Can I take up some of your time?

122
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,260
We received a report that

123
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,280
there is a strange-looking teenager here.

124
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,160
Can you understand what we are saying?

125
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,320
-Are you alone? Where are you from?
-What language are they speaking?

126
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,000
-Can you tell us?
-But I understand some words.

127
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,040
Am I extracting linguistic information

128
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,120
from the brain of this body?

129
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,500
The blood on the clothes
is not some kind of pattern, is it?

130
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Are you okay?

131
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,740
Can you tell me your name?

132
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,740
This is a language called Japanese.

133
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:25,660
This body's name is Polka Shinoyama.

134
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,680
Is he the child of foreign tourists?

135
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,380
He suffered a serious injury
to his throat.

136
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,340
It seems like the bleeding has stopped.

137
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,330
I will call an ambulance…

138
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,900
Great, it turns out you're okay.

139
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,520
Who are you?

140
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,180
The police are troublesome, aren't they?

141
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,700
Let's escape.

142
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,810
Wait…

143
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,720
Hey, stop there!

144
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,600
It seems like
something happened, Mr. Iwa.

145
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,520
On the streets of Shinjuku,
it would be strange if nothing happens.

146
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,480
Right, Ara?

147
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,960
Yeah.

148
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,700
Okay, we should go back now.

149
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Okay.

150
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,940
We seem to have escaped successfully.

151
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,000
Do you remember who I am?

152
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,540
I'm Misaki Sakimiya.

153
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,040
If you read it backwards,
it would be Sakimiya Misaki.

154
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,700
What's the point of reading it backwards?

155
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,920
The memories related to this girl

156
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,140
gradually emerged in my mind.

157
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,040
Ah, she is smiling.

158
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,000
It seems that she is a friend

159
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,160
of the owner of this body.

160
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,560
What are you doing?

161
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,540
Physical examination.

162
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,080
Bezical ezaminasion?

163
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,260
Uh, your body is still warm.

164
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,840
Your feet are also there.

165
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,340
Don't worry.

166
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,020
You're not a ghost

167
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,460
and you're doing just fine.

168
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,800
Great!

169
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,720
Uh, thank you.

170
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,580
Oh my, you are too polite.

171
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,150
It is not worth thanking for.

172
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,400
-After all…
-No, you helped me. I have to thank you.

173
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,820
Next,

174
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,440
I have to kill you again.

175
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
What?

176
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,280
Just now, I clearly used this

177
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,000
to cut your throat open.

178
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,620
Why are you still alive?

179
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,380
Shit.

180
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,160
Unexpectedly, it's this girl.

181
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,300
She killed the owner of this body.

182
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,520
Is he Polka Shinoyama?

183
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,780
Although he is only a 16-year-old kid,

184
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,060
someone hired an assassin to kill him.

185
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,720
What exactly is Misaki's

186
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,380
employer planning?

187
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,260
Anyway, this time, you have to die.

188
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,720
If not, we, the disposal agency,

189
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,860
wouldn't be able to get paid.

190
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,300
No way. Only running away
has already exhausted all my energy.

191
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,700
But speaking of which,
what exactly is the situation here?

192
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,340
It's almost imperceptible to
sense the presence of elves.

193
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,050
The magical elements in the air
are also very scarce.

194
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,880
Plus, this body has almost

195
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
no magic power.

196
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,240
In this way, I cannot heal
any new injury at all.

197
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,100
What should I do?

198
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,660
And also,

199
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,460
I can't remember why I became like this.

200
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,260
I will definitely die if I get

201
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,780
if I get another fatal injury.

202
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,990
Alright.

203
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,830
The time for playing hide-and-seek
is over now.

204
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,250
Wow, amazing!

205
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,740
It's the first time I've met someone
who can dodge my attacks.

206
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,180
I seem to be

207
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,660
getting a little excited.

208
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,920
I can react,

209
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,360
but my body cannot keep up.

210
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,000
Are you kidding me?

211
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,900
The long-awaited world

212
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,880
seems to be right in front of me.

213
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,520
At that time, I was not able to grasp it.

214
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,880
Now that I have come this far,

215
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,130
how could I possibly give up?

216
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,680
Amazing.

217
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,120
Although I have killed

218
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,820
many gangsters and assassins,

219
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,177
it's the first time someone has
ever overwhelmed me with its aura.

220
00:17:10,244 --> 00:17:12,320
I couldn't help but start to like you.

221
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,688
Here is…

222
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
This building is very famous

223
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,200
among my peers.

224
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,311
In the underworld,

225
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,333
this building is famous
as the "execution ground".

226
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:46,977
They will dissolve people here.

227
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,600
The power of science
is very powerful, isn't it?

228
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,155
And it is said that

229
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,822
ghosts or people from the underworld

230
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:54,133
often appear here,

231
00:17:54,688 --> 00:17:57,150
so it's impossible
for anyone to come over.

232
00:17:57,822 --> 00:17:59,200
Putting aside the people
in the underworld,

233
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,911
ghosts are very powerful

234
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:02,977
due to their supernatural
and mysterious abilities.

235
00:18:05,022 --> 00:18:07,355
I found that

236
00:18:08,711 --> 00:18:09,888
even with the eyes of this body,

237
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:11,466
I can see it clearly.

238
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,288
Isn't the way those guys

239
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,022
treat other people's lives here

240
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,244
too casual?

241
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,377
I see. Even this body can see

242
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,130
the spirits,

243
00:18:25,511 --> 00:18:26,844
which means

244
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:29,044
that the Evil Eye is not a power
attached to the eyeballs and brain,

245
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,733
but to the soul.

246
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,200
Hey, what's wrong?

247
00:18:33,533 --> 00:18:34,933
Are you the kind of person

248
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,240
who cherishes life?

249
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:37,755
That's right.

250
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:39,355
You should

251
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,688
also cherish life more.

252
00:18:42,244 --> 00:18:43,466
I think so too.

253
00:18:43,688 --> 00:18:46,044
After all, human life
is heavier than the Earth.

254
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,933
It's 21 grams, isn't it?

255
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:50,133
So this time,

256
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:52,200
I won't leave you with even a gram.

257
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:54,777
I will kill you

258
00:18:58,822 --> 00:19:00,340
carefully and thoughtfully!

259
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:04,377
You are not allowed to
recklessly tread on lives like this.

260
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:07,422
All lives

261
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:15,644
are my toys.

262
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,155
Do not underestimate lives.

263
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,290
Huh?

264
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,600
What's wrong with you?

265
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,266
Nothing.

266
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:37,400
I'm just worried about

267
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,400
whether I have completed the task.

268
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:40,420
What are you saying?

269
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:42,590
The records you have achieved

270
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,600
are worthy of the title
of Calamity Crusher,

271
00:19:45,911 --> 00:19:47,000
Sir Shagrua.

272
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:51,288
At the moment when my sword
was about to pierce that guy,

273
00:19:51,977 --> 00:19:54,866
he did cast a spell.

274
00:19:55,977 --> 00:19:58,822
It seemed to be the teleportation magic.

275
00:20:00,244 --> 00:20:03,333
Although I did use my Evil Eye
to capture its soul at the time,

276
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,600
its speed of dissipation

277
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,955
was way too fast.

278
00:20:07,244 --> 00:20:09,288
Did I really eliminate the Corpse God,

279
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:12,622
the necromancer?

280
00:20:13,355 --> 00:20:15,133
I just received the report

281
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,466
from the church observation team.

282
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:19,333
The aura of the Corpse God spirit

283
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,933
has completely disappeared
from this world.

284
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,888
You saved the world,

285
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,155
Sir Shagrua.

286
00:20:27,311 --> 00:20:29,533
I hope so.

287
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:34,533
My mind is gradually becoming clear.

288
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:37,066
It's full of magic now.

289
00:20:38,377 --> 00:20:40,177
I am now able to think.

290
00:20:42,577 --> 00:20:43,977
Your name is Misaki, right?

291
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,511
Although I am not sure

292
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,977
why you wanted
to kill the owner of this body,

293
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,022
named Polka Shinoyama,

294
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:51,844
I still want to

295
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,911
thank you.

296
00:20:55,222 --> 00:20:56,466
Thank you

297
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,555
for bringing me

298
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,000
to this place full of magic.

299
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:03,244
In this world,

300
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,800
maybe I could live

301
00:21:06,222 --> 00:21:07,711
a stable life.

302
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:12,022
The time for playing hide-and-seek
should indeed come to an end.

303
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,711
I won't run away anymore.

304
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:16,911
The next thing would be
the "Death God Game"

305
00:21:17,422 --> 00:21:18,844
where you and I

306
00:21:19,955 --> 00:21:23,066
will fight to death.

307
00:22:56,533 --> 00:23:00,133
Okay, let's continue.

308
00:23:02,311 --> 00:23:04,000
Poor assassin,

309
00:23:06,311 --> 00:23:08,355
how long do you plan
to pretend to be at sleep?

310
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:33,955
D-Did she die?

311
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,444
