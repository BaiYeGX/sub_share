1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,660
Hi, guys!

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,020
I'm a cosplay anchor, Proppen! Meow!

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,360
GIRL, LANDED
This time, I'm dressed as Killer Whale

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,520
from the film Berg, the Shark of Hell series 5!

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,220
Today's live show will feature me training
crows to talk in Shinjuku at sunrise.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,260
Hahaha. She's as dumb as ever.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,920
Doesn't she realize
it's three in the morning?

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,360
Huh? It's freezing, meow.

9
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:29,020
Huh? That's right in our neighborhood.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,020
There they are! It's the crows.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,560
Meow? What are they looking at, meow?

12
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,820
Huh? What is that?

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,960
No way. What's that?

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,360
Hands! Those are hands! Meow!

15
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,760
Bff!

16
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,340
(Episode 13: The Invaders)

17
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:20,920
Yo!

18
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,540
Ugh, you're so late, Mr. Iwa.

19
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,640
Sorry.

20
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,280
I got called into investigation HQ
on my way here.

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,440
Well, as much as
I'd like to order a lockdown…

22
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:35,160
But locking down the building requires
a search warrant or owner approval.

23
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,860
The owner of the building… that'd be…

24
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,720
Her?

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,660
Well?

26
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,160
Who told you about this place?

27
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,620
Hm. Mister Daren.

28
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,680
Oh, if he introduced you,
then you're good.

29
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,780
However, we have heard rumors
about this place before.

30
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,940
After all, Shinjuku's intermediary agency
is well-known among assassins.

31
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,420
You're known for having relaxed rules
and homey atmosphere.

32
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,200
It's an honor for the siblings,

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,380
known, at one time, as the aces of
Shibuya, to speak so highly of us.

34
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,240
Horojima Rinne and

35
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,780
Horojima Hiiro.

36
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,140
But I don't remember ever
introducing myself in Shibuya.

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

38
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,680
I didn't think it was a secret

39
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:21,079
because it was so easy to find out.

40
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,079
Our rules may be relaxed,

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,440
but when you overstep your bounds,
the consequences can be scary.

42
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,180
Hmm, you fella actually are a nasty?

43
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,060
Oh, thank you for the compliment.

44
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,440
Don't address Clarissa as "fella."

45
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,680
Just because you're tall
doesn't mean you're a big deal.

46
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,800
Stop it!

47
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,940
Cute.

48
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,720
Anyway, I always welcome
new people to take on work for me.

49
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,170
MYSTERY IN SHINJUKU
After all, it looks like

50
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,060
FLOCK OF HANDS APPEARS IN SHINJUKU OVERNIGHT
we'll be getting pretty busy.

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,340
Do you have an explanation to any of this?

52
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,760
Um…

53
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,440
Look. It's up to you if you want to ruin
your plans for a peaceful life.

54
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,780
I think we'll have to use
the back entrance for a little while.

55
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,020
-This is the place.
-Solitaire was here!

56
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:14,020
I'm not interested in being the center
of that much attention.

57
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,340
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,279
Were you controlling all these hands?

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,220
In a sense.

60
00:04:20,221 --> 00:04:24,240
Some think it was Solitaire's trick,
while others think it was paranormal.

61
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,740
But how many people could say
it was surely not a magic trick?

62
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,260
Good point.

63
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,040
Solitaire and Lemmings
might have realized it too.

64
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,260
Also, Xiaoyu may have realized it too.

65
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,140
INCOMING CALL, MASTER

66
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,880
What should we do next, leader?

67
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:43,960
Anyway, Arase and I will go in.

68
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,880
It's better to stop now, Mr. Iwa.

69
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,220
Those troublesome magazine
journalists have also arrived.

70
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,620
What?

71
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,740
You think that guy who came in
for a divination was Solitaire?

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,480
Yeah.

73
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,840
His face looked completely different,

74
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,820
but the color of his soul was the same.

75
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,320
As was the soul haunting him.

76
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,240
What about that high school girl?

77
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,560
Well…

78
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,060
Good boy.

79
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,780
It's no use, Lord Corpse God.

80
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,300
The girl simply
won't show her true colors.

81
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,380
However, her dog's tail is most adorable.

82
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,080
Huh? So there really was a dog?

83
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,460
Hmm, that dog was at home the whole time.

84
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,200
But for some reason, it ran away.

85
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,780
Her real father is at home too.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,220
The one who left midway is a fake.

87
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,040
Could he have been her sugar daddy?

88
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,360
Sugar patty?

89
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,900
Sugar patty!

90
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,440
Sorry. My bad.

91
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,480
What drew Solitaire's attention to us?

92
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,140
That he came asking questions about
that symbol tells me

93
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,320
he targeted us from the very start.

94
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,080
Guess I'd better report this
to Sis Clarissa.

95
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,960
Moreover,

96
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,140
that writing on the wall.

97
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,080
From the looks of it,
it could be Fire-breathing Bug.

98
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,380
What did he mean by
"a product of Sabaramond"?

99
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,080
It made you fly off the handle
and cast that huge spell.

100
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,920
Is it related to the world
from which you came?

101
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
Mr. Arius Sabaramond.

102
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,660
He was the head court wizard

103
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,860
of the Byandy Empire, the country

104
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,480
my master and I live in
one hundred years ago.

105
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600
Now, boy.

106
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,060
A word for you first.

107
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,160
Apart from your Evil Eye's
ability to see spirits,

108
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,620
you have no magical talents.

109
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,736
SHOCK

110
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,640
In fact, even your evil eye is more
like a Spiritual Disposition.

111
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,560
It's not really a talent.

112
00:06:38,784 --> 00:06:39,584
SHOCK

113
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,360
But don't worry.

114
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,980
I'll still train you.

115
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,880
I will raise you to be

116
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,120
SLUMP
the tenth-ranked court wizard.

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,680
Why not the first-ranked one?

118
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm surprised at your ambition.

119
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,460
Because Utsurojuza, who occupies

120
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,820
the third rank, is in a league apart
from those ranked fourth and below.

121
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,440
And I'm in the second place.

122
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,140
And the one who occupies
the first place is half-politician.

123
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,820
Ability alone won't cut it.

124
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,300
That's not true.

125
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,800
In terms of ability,

126
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,660
you should be standing in my position.

127
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,920
Look, boy.

128
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,380
He is here to evaluate your abilities now.

129
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,600
Evaluating whether you could become
a tool of court politics in the future.

130
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,100
Don't make fun of me, Easlies.

131
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,240
All people are equally valuable.

132
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,500
So I can't do the evaluation.

133
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,560
Mr. Sabaramond was a nice person.

134
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,960
Renowned throughout the Empire.

135
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,159
Crowds of people would flock to any event
where he made an appearance.

136
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,200
Just like what we'd call a celebrity here.

137
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,300
Like Kannagi Ryouma?

138
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,860
I am really surprised.

139
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,680
To hear the name of an idol from you
instead of sharks.

140
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,140
Isn't it obvious?

141
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:01,720
When he was a kid, he played a background
character in Berg, the Shark of Hell Z.

142
00:08:02,144 --> 00:08:04,070
STARRING: SHARK BERG
And that character will become

143
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,120
No.2 Male Lead in the upcoming film.

144
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,420
Didn't you know?

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,280
They're making another sequel?

146
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,660
Alright, let's put this aside for now.

147
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,960
So how did Fire-breathing Bug
know Sabaramond?

148
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,100
That's what's troubling me too.

149
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,540
They appear to be in
a hostile relationship.

150
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,700
Sabaramond lived
a hundred years ago, right?

151
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,860
Shouldn't he have already died?

152
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,880
I don't know what became of Mr. Sabaramond
after the collapse of the Empire.

153
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,020
But I believe a wizard like him

154
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,240
could easily extend his life
by one or two hundred years.

155
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,059
Whoa. Magic from parallel universes
is really something.

156
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,179
A capable enough wizard can

157
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,440
at least slow down the aging process.

158
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:45,880
That's not what's
important here, though, is it?

159
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,960
If this matter has something
to do with him,

160
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,340
doesn't that mean you have an ally?

161
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,480
This…

162
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,320
I just don't want to
dredge up old memories.

163
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,280
But if

164
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,820
this "product of Sabaramond"
is connected to the Empire…

165
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,680
It was solely for my own benefit

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,540
that I fled that world
to come to this one.

167
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm just an outsider actually.

168
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,480
Even so…

169
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,000
STARE

170
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,580
Understood.

171
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,460
Yes. We'll take

172
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,040
the same precautions we did
five years ago with Hosorogi.

173
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,220
All under the protection of Sabaramond.

174
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,540
Those snipers have skipped town.

175
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,400
There's one in the Agakura available.

176
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,900
Listen up.

177
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,140
UNDERGROUND WATER TANK
Our job is just to create a distraction.

178
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,740
KEEP OUT
Kill as many as you can.

179
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,820
We are not people.

180
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,660
We are bullets shot out.

181
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,960
Don't let your desire overtake you.
Focus on your blood lust.

182
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,680
Prove that we're not inferior
to the Heilei or Agakura!

183
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,700
What…?

184
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,620
What?

185
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,340
What is that huge guy?

186
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,780
So close.

187
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,720
You guys were so close.

188
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,580
You were just a step away.

189
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,580
A hair's breadth away.

190
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,700
It's a shame that you didn't become
the "bullet that reaches the summit."

191
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,800
This is not good.

192
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,060
Bullets mustn't be so scared.

193
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,740
How can you prove that
you're not inferior to Agakura?

194
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,400
Momoya, how're things there?

195
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,500
All done. It was a close one.

196
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,640
I could've died.

197
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,600
I didn't know much about them.
Maybe they were strong?

198
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,720
How are you doing there?

199
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,780
You were handling
these guys' main unit, right?

200
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,080
How many dead?

201
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,540
No casualties.
It was over in five seconds.

202
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,060
What a shame.

203
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,160
You've got a new gig, Momoya.

204
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,600
We are told to make an appearance
at the intermediary agency in Shibuya.

205
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,740
Apparently, the gig's in Shinjuku.

206
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,840
Shinjuku, huh.

207
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,100
If I get to meet Solitaire,
I hope I can get his autograph.

208
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,300
Hello?

209
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,800
What on earth was that, Master?

210
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,080
Alright, calm down, Xiaoyu.

211
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,000
Something invisible was
obstructing Lemmings.

212
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,700
I thought it must be some kind
of stealth-suit technology.

213
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,440
PARANORMAL ACTIVITY? OR SOLITAIRE'S TRICK?
But that was not a trick.

214
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,240
There was definitely something there.

215
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,740
The fake Polka.

216
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,680
I knew we should get rid of him.

217
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,180
Now, listen.

218
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,300
That something didn't attack you, right?

219
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,940
Then it might be your ally.

220
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,760
Do you know something?

221
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,380
Xiaoyu.

222
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,280
What's the job I asked of you?

223
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:04,100
Protect Lady Sayo and the fake Polka.

224
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,140
I'm glad you remember.

225
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,800
I'm really sorry.

226
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,560
I do know the secret of the fake Polka.

227
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,200
But no matter what I say,

228
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,400
you wouldn't accept it now, would you?

229
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,700
How come?

230
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:23,180
I said there was no problem with the fake
Polka, but you still don't believe me.

231
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,340
Well…

232
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,820
Never mind. It's not something
that can be clarified in a few words.

233
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,280
Alright.

234
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,540
You may ask him directly.

235
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:38,160
If he won't tell you,
I can beg him if necessary.

236
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,760
N-No way.

237
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:42,460
How can Master beg him?

238
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,320
If that's the case,
you have to try to make him believe you.

239
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,520
I trust that fake Polka.

240
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,200
Try having an honest
heart-to-heart with him.

241
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,920
What's the matter?

242
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,640
Shinjuku is, after all,
Kuraki's territory.

243
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,600
I'd like to keep
from attracting attention.

244
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,300
Ah, I just saw a familiar face.

245
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,440
Didn't all his limbs get smashed?
He's quite something.

246
00:13:11,441 --> 00:13:13,180
He has my respect.

247
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,000
Those Heilei guys.

248
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,920
They're as stubborn as centipedes.

249
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,780
What's wrong, Arase?

250
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,200
Nothing.

251
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,800
I just thought I spotted a familiar face.

252
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,420
It couldn't be, could it?

253
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,480
So, what should we do, Polka?

254
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,180
I'll be leaving all this parallel-universe
stuff to you, okay?

255
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,900
I…

256
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,420
Good morning.

257
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,700
G-Good morning.

258
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
What's the matter? Why the long face?

259
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,820
Don't make that face.

260
00:13:49,821 --> 00:13:51,080
Now smile.

261
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,960
Hahaha.

262
00:13:52,961 --> 00:13:53,620
What's that?

263
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,320
Nice to meet you.

264
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,840
This is my business card.

265
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,500
Weekly Dry.

266
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,260
She says we're going to be in the news!

267
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:06,840
Huh?

268
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,540
Weekly Dry

269
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,860
is a weekly tabloid founded in 1996 by
the editorial department of Anywhere, Inc.

270
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:23,320
They cover everything from serious
political stories and the arts

271
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,680
to local gossip, the occult,
and the latest games.

272
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,800
It is one of the largest newspapers in the
nation, publishing 220 000 copies weekly.

273
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,200
But the Corpse God
knows nothing about that!

274
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,100
Neither does the real Polka!

275
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,300
Kochou Eightport is a capable junior
reporter at Weekly Dry!

276
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,340
Whether she's covering
politics or the arts,

277
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:44,220
she knows no fear and
has written some fine exposes!

278
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,760
Can Polka and the others protect
their originally peaceful lives

279
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,440
in the face of this surprise media visit?

280
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,880
You can do it, Takumi.
Don't give up, Takumi.

281
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,440
You're the only one we can count on!

282
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,000
SELF-NARRATING TO ESCAPE REALITY

283
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,880
We're going to be in the news?

284
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,140
That's right. Hee hee.

285
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:05,800
We're going to become
famous all over the country.

286
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,020
Well, I haven't done anything.
I'm innocent.

287
00:15:10,021 --> 00:15:12,160
That's exactly how someone
who has done something reacts.

288
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,440
That's exactly how a character who gets
eaten by a shark in the second act reacts.

289
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,660
Ahaha.

290
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,780
Please relax.

291
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,380
I came here to cover
the famous new diviner.

292
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,940
Oh, the divine.

293
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,860
Sorry, we can't trust a reporter who shows
up without permission to take pictures.

294
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,280
I apologize for this.

295
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,720
I just wanted a candid shot.

296
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,420
Of course, if you refuse
the interview, that's fine.

297
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,860
In that case,
I'll cover a different story.

298
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,520
A different story?

299
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,940
Like the drone regularly
flying around the area?

300
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,500
It would be bad if an intelligence dealer
took pictures without consent.

301
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,620
This jerk!

302
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,400
She did her research on me
before coming here.

303
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,920
Haha, I've figured it out.

304
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,860
You came here intending
to expose a sham diviner

305
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,500
who works with an intelligence dealer, huh?

306
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,220
EXPOSED!SHAM DIVINER WORKING WITH INFORMANT
Oh, hohoho.

307
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,700
I don't mind if we're exposed as frauds.

308
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,440
The problem is that Clarissa
might also be suspected by others.

309
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,920
If that happens…

310
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,740
I'm screwed, to put it mildly.

311
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,200
I have to settle this thing peacefully.

312
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,180
Takumi Kuruya.

313
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,720
An intelligence dealer formerly associated
with the gang Sons of the Styx.

314
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,500
A genius who established his own
software company at the age of 14.

315
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,840
But evil adults took over his company.

316
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,720
In the end,

317
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,060
your family committed suicide together.

318
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,140
After you survived alone,

319
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,260
you then entered into criminal society.

320
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,200
Your life could make a good story.

321
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,380
But you're not my target this time.

322
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,780
A diviner?

323
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,460
Yes.

324
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,020
I want to interview the new diviner
Corpse God in Shinjuku.

325
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,300
Can you please give me a column for this?

326
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,300
That wouldn't be a problem.

327
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,740
But you were on
the Solitaire case, weren't you?

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,319
Yes.

329
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,500
The two are related.

330
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,380
Hmm?

331
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,420
That diviner is something.

332
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:20,040
The detectives involved in
the Solitaire case went to see him.

333
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:25,660
After the fire at the Shinoyama house
caused by the fake Fire-breathing Bug,

334
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,440
there was information that he's actually
a member of the Shinoyama family.

335
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,300
Oh? But just with this…

336
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,860
I know those detectives aren't the type
to waste time on dead ends.

337
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,440
My time-honed intuition
as a reporter is telling.

338
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,220
Solitaire's escape, the Shinoyama fire,
and the mysterious diviner…

339
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,500
They're all connected.

340
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:51,960
The police might actually be involved with
the attempted assassination of Solitaire.

341
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,580
Uh…

342
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,360
THIS IS ONLY YOUR THIRD YEAR AT THE COMPANY
Your time-honed intuition?

343
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,020
Okay, as long as you restrict
your story to just the divine…

344
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,640
Thank you very much.

345
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,660
I look forward to working
with you from now on.

346
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,020
So do you want me to tell
your fortune first, Miss Kochou?

347
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,940
No, I want to remain
as objective as possible.

348
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,900
If it's all right, starting tomorrow,

349
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,620
I'd like you to meet some clients that
we prepared who want their fortunes told.

350
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,580
I see. Got it.

351
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,080
Let me say this upfront.

352
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,640
Just promise not to harass the clients
currently lined up, okay?

353
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,800
People come here for many reasons,
and some prefer anonymity.

354
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,040
Sure, I won't be any trouble.

355
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,560
What a good reporter!

356
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,560
Let's just hope so.

357
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,600
Alright, let's get ready for business.

358
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,940
I'll help too.

359
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,480
Hoho. It went very smoothly.

360
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,800
Jackpot! This ticket is really paying off!

361
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,440
I can't believe Solitaire appeared
at this building this morning!

362
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,780
If my information's accurate,

363
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,400
the Corpse God's real name
is Polka Shinoyama.

364
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,820
A Shinoyama teaming up with an intelligence
dealer to act as diviner is suspicious!

365
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,980
And yet, the moment I said I was here to
cover his divination, he seemed relieved!

366
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,300
This is obviously very suspicious.

367
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,660
And,

368
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,360
isn't that the line Fire-breathing Bug
leaves at the scenes of their crime?

369
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,180
I hit the lottery so hard.
I'm actually a little freaked out.

370
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,380
FIDGET
But as a reporter,

371
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,500
FIDGET
I must ask!

372
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,720
Um…

373
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,240
I've been meaning to ask.

374
00:19:16,241 --> 00:19:19,320
Are the words on the wall
left by Fire-breathing bug?

375
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,620
Huh? When did this…

376
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,900
Don't care about us.
Just our daily shark wrestling.

377
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,520
That graffiti was there
before we moved in.

378
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,760
We thought it was too much trouble to
clean up so we didn't. Is there a problem?

379
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,200
Y-Yes. Th-That's right.

380
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,280
Just stop talking already.

381
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,220
I see.

382
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,920
I doubt that.

383
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,040
The writing looks fresh.

384
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,120
Would it be simplistic to connect them
to Fire-breathing bug?

385
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,200
No, I can't be careless.

386
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,640
The Shinoyama conglomerate is already
at the center of plenty of dark rumors.

387
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,160
Are you okay, Nezu?

388
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,740
Alright, so let me get this straight.

389
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,920
Those weren't the work of Solitaire?

390
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,960
I see.

391
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,700
You can take a little time off now.

392
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,800
Both Solitaire and Grandpa's guards
have their eyes on you.

393
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,340
And next week, you'll be busy
with your main job, right?

394
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,560
No need to thank me. Just don't get too
badly beat up doing your other job.

395
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,520
So that was him showing gratitude.

396
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,360
Taipei.

397
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,020
Yes, sir.

398
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,260
Get in touch with the main forces of
the Lei family and go after Solitaire.

399
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,000
You can hang around near
the building Polka's in.

400
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,260
-Can I kill him?
-Try to bring him in alive.

401
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,940
I'm curious to see
what he knows about Polka.

402
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:56,040
And I want to thank him for the drop
in Shinoyama's stock prices.

403
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,960
As you wish.

404
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,160
Bao.

405
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,300
Hmm?

406
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,500
You support him from behind the scenes
by providing intel.

407
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,980
Hmm, got it.

408
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,660
The police are devoting a lot of
their men to the Solitaire case.

409
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,600
Although they are sending people
to search for him,

410
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,680
they're probably following our movements.

411
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,920
Don't let your guard down
around the police.

412
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,820
They're a real nest of vipers.

413
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,600
I thought I smelled a nosy rat.

414
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,060
So it's the Shinoyama.

415
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,580
Depending on the situation,
I may have to ask you to withdraw.

416
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,280
Yes, their connection is more
interesting than I thought.

417
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,960
You're going to be okay?

418
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,520
No matter what, your story will
run in the occult section…

419
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,760
Leave it to me, chief!

420
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
My intuition's telling me

421
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,904
that in this building, something
interesting is bound to happen.

422
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,080
Ah, I see.

423
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,700
If I'd known you were a bartender,

424
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,840
I would have made your death
as elegant as a cocktail.

425
