1
00:00:02,163 --> 00:00:05,723
Oh my, I just spent a ton of money
because of you.

2
00:00:06,263 --> 00:00:09,123
The condition for forming
a two-hundred-year contract with me

3
00:00:09,223 --> 00:00:12,243
is that I have to buy back
your remains from the guild?

4
00:00:12,383 --> 00:00:14,143
Dragons really are a different breed.

5
00:00:14,683 --> 00:00:17,323
I'm sorry, my temporary master.

6
00:00:18,303 --> 00:00:23,603
I just prefer those with weak bonds not be
permitted to do whatever they like with my body.

7
00:00:24,623 --> 00:00:30,723
But the beloved pupil of Wandering Balcony,
the one who killed me, is a bond that will more than suffice.

8
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:32,863
Don't mind him, my foolish disciple.

9
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:36,123
There are those like him in the world.

10
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:37,963
I formally give you the promise.

11
00:00:38,423 --> 00:00:43,223
The body I'll leave in the mortal plane,
you may use as armor to dwell in.

12
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:45,743
You may reanimate it into an undead ally,

13
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:48,283
turn it into ingredients for medicine.

14
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:51,943
Or even use it to form
a new bond with someone.

15
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:57,063
I have bound you to a dragon's fate.

(Dead Mount, Death Play)

17
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:31,892
(Episode 20: The Visitors)

18
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:35,172
I think novels that
have adventurers guilds

19
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:37,432
have a lot in common with shark movies.

20
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:41,612
Don't go saying things that'll piss off
the fanbase of either of those.

21
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:47,052
Adventurers guilds are common in
otherworldly reincarnations and transfers.

22
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:49,142
GUILD
Based on this,

23
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:50,952
GUILD
the authors add some original element

24
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:52,932
so that each story is ultimately
original and unique.

25
00:02:53,652 --> 00:02:55,272
Shark movies are the same.

26
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:58,472
They all share the same gimmick,
the man-eating shark.

27
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:01,212
But they'll add a unique twist. Maybe
there's a tornado, or ghosts, or demons, or zombies,

28
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:04,052
or sharks that can swim on sand or through snow.
Maybe it's an atomic shark, or a robot, or a mecha,

29
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:06,512
or three-headed…

30
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:09,472
Or even six-headed.

31
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:11,272
And all these different elements make each
and every one of them original, see?

32
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:14,452
Yeah, but aren't period pieces
and westerns the same way?

33
00:03:14,552 --> 00:03:16,192
Yeah. That's why

34
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:19,512
you could call a period piece
and westerns a shark movie.

35
00:03:19,812 --> 00:03:21,992
And since they say that
all the story archetypes

36
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:24,772
in the world were covered by Shakespeare.

37
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,992
SHARKSPEARE

38
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:28,992
REPRESENTATIVE WORK: AN EYE FOR AN EYE
Maybe Shakespeare was a shark?

39
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:32,172
Right. So can you get to your point?

40
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:35,012
I'm just trying to say that
we should see what's unique

41
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:37,172
about the kind of
"Vampire" Miss Misaki is.

42
00:03:37,252 --> 00:03:38,932
Huh? Me?

43
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:40,912
Talk about beating around the bush.

44
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:45,812
I think it's important for us all to know

45
00:03:46,132 --> 00:03:48,092
how far from the usual "Vampire"
stereotypes Miss Misaki deviates.

46
00:03:48,652 --> 00:03:52,772
Also to keep bad guys from discovering
her strengths and weaknesses.

47
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:55,292
Well, you've got a point there.

48
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:57,792
How about this?
Are you okay with sunlight?

49
00:03:57,952 --> 00:04:01,072
Yep. Only, it seems
a little brighter to me.

50
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:03,532
Do you drink blood?

51
00:04:03,672 --> 00:04:04,572
Huh?

52
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:06,952
Blood, according to Corpse God,

53
00:04:07,032 --> 00:04:09,192
is a stimulant for them.

54
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,152
To convert others into their companions,

55
00:04:11,272 --> 00:04:14,632
they need to give large amounts of their
own blood over the course of many years.

56
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:16,592
Thus, they rarely feed on blood.

57
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:20,272
However, it is possible to improve
the breed through magic.

58
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:21,792
No, or rather, evolve.

59
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:26,852
Isn't Misaki's transformation into
a vampire a typical example?

60
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:30,712
Just like a cyborg.

61
00:04:31,296 --> 00:04:32,864
LIKE A CYBORG

62
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:35,672
Sorry.

63
00:04:36,612 --> 00:04:38,832
I got you involved for my own sake.

64
00:04:39,732 --> 00:04:43,232
But it was the greatest proof
of my trust that I could show you.

65
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:46,012
I swear on the dragon whose arm
that used to be and,

66
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:49,292
and on my master,
who allowed me to do this.

67
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:51,592
I trust you.

68
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:54,272
So please form a pact with me.

69
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,812
Lend me your strength.

70
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:01,712
It's unbelievable.

71
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:02,932
Not to mention those tigers.

72
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:05,132
I can't believe you're showing me this.

73
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:07,872
And this shark plushie is?

74
00:05:07,992 --> 00:05:10,192
Oh. That's the real Polka.

75
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:11,992
-What?
-Yeah, yeah.

76
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:14,362
He means Polka is currently possessing

77
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:16,012
MECHANICAL ARM AND THE DRAGON'S ARM
that stuffed shark toy.

78
00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:16,932
MECHANICAL ARM AND THE DRAGON'S ARM
I see.

79
00:05:17,252 --> 00:05:20,032
He seems to be enjoying himself in there.

80
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,272
I was pretty dumbfounded myself.

81
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:23,692
I see.

82
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:28,632
And now the spoiled boy says
rather than getting back his own body,

83
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:30,692
he'd like his body to change into a robot.

84
00:05:32,772 --> 00:05:36,112
NICE TO MEET YOU
Uh, he says nice to meet you, Xiaoyu.

85
00:05:36,692 --> 00:05:37,692
Yeah.

86
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:39,312
Young Master Polka.

87
00:05:39,552 --> 00:05:41,992
MECHA HAND! DRAGON HAND! OH!
Nice to meet you.

88
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:46,172
Huh? Is he even more antagonistic
with real Polka than with me?

89
00:05:46,812 --> 00:05:48,292
I-In any case,

90
00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,292
I'm happy for your cooperation.

91
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:53,712
There is no doubt
that we are indeed being targeted.

92
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:57,352
When it comes to the organization
affiliated with that empire's sigil,

93
00:05:57,912 --> 00:06:00,132
I want us to prepare ourselves
as much as we can.

94
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:04,452
You are…very good at…investigating.

95
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,272
Right, Moth?

96
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:10,112
This will…benefit you too.

97
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:15,192
As a moth…who craves that…
which transcends…the natural laws.

98
00:06:15,432 --> 00:06:16,572
Oh?

99
00:06:16,992 --> 00:06:22,212
Their ancestor…is a product…
who came from…the other side of the sky.

100
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:25,072
A bug…eating away…at this world.

101
00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:27,092
The other side of the sky?

102
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:29,772
Are you saying aliens?

103
00:06:30,132 --> 00:06:32,132
I'm not sure…about that.

104
00:06:32,772 --> 00:06:37,752
But…it is pretty close to…
what you are…looking for.

105
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:40,112
Pretty close?

106
00:06:40,252 --> 00:06:41,652
Anything else?

107
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:46,432
You should know…just…
as well as we do…Moth.

108
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,852
Humph, you're right.

109
00:06:49,432 --> 00:06:54,492
If my aerial show started it all,

110
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:58,952
it is all connected.

111
00:06:59,432 --> 00:07:02,192
Of course, that includes you too.

112
00:07:02,492 --> 00:07:04,112
Fire-breathing Bug.

113
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:08,652
Oh, you have returned.

114
00:07:08,852 --> 00:07:12,712
I'll be going back and forth between
here and the headquarters for a while.

115
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:15,192
These documents are quite old.

116
00:07:15,492 --> 00:07:17,692
I am digging into the past
of Fire-breathing Bug.

117
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:21,212
We already knew that Habaki's men
and the Fire-breathing Bug were at odds.

118
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:22,712
Uh-huh.

119
00:07:22,892 --> 00:07:25,072
Your reactions are as muted as ever.

120
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:28,152
Fire-breathing Bug has only been
on the scene for the past few years.

121
00:07:28,372 --> 00:07:31,092
Both the police
and the media believe this.

122
00:07:31,252 --> 00:07:32,452
Isn't this the truth?

123
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,492
THIS WORLD SHOULD BE CONSUMED BY FLAME
I found this just this morning.

124
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:38,492
It seems like they only started
using English recently.

125
00:07:39,972 --> 00:07:43,092
That means Fire-breathing Bug
has been around

126
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:45,652
since way before I joined Comps-3.

127
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:48,292
Okay.

128
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:50,992
Next customer, please.

129
00:07:51,392 --> 00:07:53,532
Looks like he's pretty popular.

130
00:07:53,632 --> 00:07:55,592
It's surprisingly crowded here.

131
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:58,092
What's wrong with you? Miss Soara.

132
00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:00,932
Nothing, I don't know why, but…

133
00:08:01,052 --> 00:08:04,712
I just got chills
or something deep in my bones.

134
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:05,992
Oh?

135
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:07,952
I feel something's in the air.

136
00:08:07,952 --> 00:08:09,752
I'm so jealous.

137
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:13,332
You must have sensed something.

138
00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:16,132
An unknown power that's not of this world.

139
00:08:16,392 --> 00:08:19,492
After all, the diviner
here is the real deal.

140
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,872
-Check out this video. It happened in this building.
-What is that? It's hand! Hand!

141
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:26,412
Is this related to Phantom Solitaire?

142
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:30,732
Although it appears that
everyone believes this, I do not.

143
00:08:31,772 --> 00:08:35,132
Solitaire is always looking for ways
to have fun and never acts with a plan.

144
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:38,172
But he likes to surprise the audience.

145
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:40,272
Exactly because of this,

146
00:08:40,492 --> 00:08:44,372
it doesn't make sense for him to pull off
such an incredible feat without any warning.

147
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:46,512
If it is not a trick,

148
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:49,592
was Solitaire attacked
by some mystery phenomenon?

149
00:08:49,712 --> 00:08:51,972
Not necessarily.

150
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,052
Meaning?

151
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:57,892
He might enjoy playing
with those strange hands.

152
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:04,532
That's so overly romantic.

153
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:07,512
Right? It's so romantic.

154
00:09:10,612 --> 00:09:12,992
Ticket number 25, please come in.

155
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:15,592
Oh, looks like my number's up.

156
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:17,512
Can I ask you your name?

157
00:09:18,192 --> 00:09:19,912
I'm Mikoto.

158
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,112
Saimyouji Mikoto.

159
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:25,565
MIKOTO
You can find me on SNS if you search for my name in English.

160
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,612
MIKOTO
Nice to meet you.

161
00:09:26,752 --> 00:09:27,936
FORTUNE-TELLING

162
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:31,352
You two sure hit it off.

163
00:09:31,452 --> 00:09:33,992
Yeah, I guess he and I clicked.

164
00:09:34,912 --> 00:09:35,792
Huh?

165
00:09:35,872 --> 00:09:37,112
What's wrong?

166
00:09:37,552 --> 00:09:40,172
That person just now is a forensic doctor.

167
00:09:40,472 --> 00:09:41,352
Oh.

168
00:09:41,472 --> 00:09:45,032
Please state your name
and what you'd like divined.

169
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:47,812
MIKOTO, I'M A FORENSICS SPEALIST IN TOKYO
My name is Civil.

170
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:49,792
MIKOTO, I'M A FORENSICS SPEALIST IN TOKYO
As for what I want divined,

171
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:52,832
I'd like it to be about a fate
that spans a hundred years

172
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:55,032
and new encounters.

173
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:59,152
I 'd like to get Mr. Saimyouji's opinion.

174
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:01,112
Did he not come today?

175
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:02,752
I didn't see him.

176
00:10:03,092 --> 00:10:05,072
He must be very busy too, I assume.

177
00:10:05,152 --> 00:10:07,852
In comparison, he's always here.

178
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:11,272
He's recently become interested in
people who have supernatural abilities.

179
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:12,432
Interesting.

180
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,472
Huh?

181
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:17,212
It's the diviner, the young kid
who suddenly showed up in town.

182
00:10:17,352 --> 00:10:20,992
Hmm. Young fortune-teller, huh?

183
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,328
CLOSED

184
00:10:23,692 --> 00:10:27,752
That pen is Prosecutor Hosorogi?

185
00:10:27,872 --> 00:10:30,176
HEH-HEH. LOOKING FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU, KID

186
00:10:32,012 --> 00:10:35,092
Phantom Solitaire is likely to be shocked
when he finds out about this.

187
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,112
Huh? No, when I was
confronting him before…

188
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:41,332
SOLITAIRE SPREADS LIES
I'll repay my debt

189
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:42,612
SOLITAIRE SPREADS LIES
to Hozologi another time.

190
00:10:42,872 --> 00:10:44,912
He seemed quite worried.

191
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:49,972
I wondered if Prosecutor Hosorogi
would be a benefactor of Solitaire.

192
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:51,592
Oh, I see.

193
00:10:52,096 --> 00:10:53,216
NO, NO, NO! I HAVE ZERO
RECOLLECTION OF THAT GUY!

194
00:10:53,216 --> 00:10:55,936
WHAT THE HECK? I'M SCARED! HELP!
THE PEN IS WRITING NON-STOP

195
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:58,272
Phantom Solitaire…

196
00:10:58,572 --> 00:11:00,652
What exactly is his purpose?

197
00:11:01,212 --> 00:11:03,012
Is it all right
if I call in the next person?

198
00:11:03,132 --> 00:11:05,372
Oh, yes. Please.

199
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:07,612
Then I'll get back to work.

200
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,972
Sis Sayo requested
the Glehnia Root Hot Pot for dinner.

201
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:13,772
Looking forward to it.

202
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:19,752
What's this?

203
00:11:20,152 --> 00:11:21,572
What's coming?

204
00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,572
Next.

205
00:11:28,072 --> 00:11:29,632
Pardon me.

206
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:34,432
Nice to meet you.

207
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:35,972
My name is Civil.

208
00:11:46,492 --> 00:11:47,672
Thank you for having me.

209
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,376
I can't believe it.

210
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:54,936
He is nothing more than a human.

211
00:11:55,056 --> 00:11:58,136
I've never seen spirits of the dead
so strongly fuse together before.

212
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:03,136
Even if this person had slaughtering
millions on a battlefield,

213
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:04,316
it wouldn't be like this.

214
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:10,056
These particular spirits of the dead have
been maturing for decades and decades…

215
00:12:10,656 --> 00:12:11,656
Besides,

216
00:12:11,896 --> 00:12:13,916
only a very few of these spirits
bear ill will.

217
00:12:14,376 --> 00:12:16,656
The majority feel neither regret
nor love but rather…

218
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:17,996
Obsession?

219
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,936
Anything wrong?

220
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,196
I'd better not let my anxiety show.

221
00:12:22,536 --> 00:12:25,276
I'll cast the spell of
false face on myself

222
00:12:25,876 --> 00:12:28,016
and paster on a serene smile.

223
00:12:29,996 --> 00:12:34,156
Looks like you've had a rough life.

224
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:35,676
Oh?

225
00:12:35,876 --> 00:12:39,276
Everyone around me says that,
but it's been surprisingly dull.

226
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:40,916
Hey, what's wrong?

227
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:43,756
Is this normal?

228
00:12:44,636 --> 00:12:47,456
I can't make up my mind
whether he's a fraud or the real thing.

229
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:52,496
I can tell from
the building watchers' cell phones

230
00:12:52,716 --> 00:12:56,536
that they monitor and protect the diviner.

231
00:12:57,496 --> 00:12:59,196
Let's pry a little, then.

232
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:01,716
That reminds me.

233
00:13:02,076 --> 00:13:05,536
That amazing criminal Solitaire
came to this building, didn't he?

234
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:07,076
Apparently so.

235
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:08,656
Have you seen him?

236
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:11,516
Perhaps I caught a glimpse
of him while I was not looking.

237
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:14,796
Our fates have already crossed.

238
00:13:15,516 --> 00:13:17,356
Hmm…

239
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,576
I knew it. This computer's
functions are severely lacking.

240
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:23,696
I should've asked Granny
to put this together.

241
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:27,036
What are you doing?

242
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:29,396
Just like yesterday…

243
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,416
I'm hungry, so I'm heading out.

244
00:13:31,516 --> 00:13:33,056
See you.

245
00:13:33,236 --> 00:13:37,536
I never expected you
to abandon me and leave.

246
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:39,916
It's just a little mischief.

247
00:13:40,076 --> 00:13:41,516
By the way,

248
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:45,096
now give me a cooler,
more celebrity-worthy smile.

249
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:47,096
Please don't ask for the impossible.

250
00:13:47,356 --> 00:13:48,516
It's alright.

251
00:13:48,576 --> 00:13:51,136
I believe you can do it.

252
00:13:51,196 --> 00:13:53,676
Look, more importantly, where's my phone?

253
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:55,896
The police might track down
the signal and come here.

254
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,976
It has already…been burned.

255
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:01,116
That was expensive.

256
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:06,076
You fear…the police more than…you do me?

257
00:14:06,156 --> 00:14:07,636
Depending on how things go down.

258
00:14:07,976 --> 00:14:11,376
Even compared to…
the products of…Sabaramond?

259
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,156
Sabaramond?

260
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:14,676
What is that?

261
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:17,936
I was just remembering
this police officer named Arase.

262
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:21,056
After all, he could have tortured me.

263
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:22,256
Hmph.

264
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,796
So you're not familiar with them?

265
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:27,496
No, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

266
00:14:28,736 --> 00:14:31,756
Then you and I are comrades!

267
00:14:31,816 --> 00:14:32,756
Huh?

268
00:14:33,576 --> 00:14:34,336
Um.

269
00:14:34,368 --> 00:14:37,472
COMPLETED, PLEASE CONFIRM

270
00:14:38,096 --> 00:14:42,596
Let's unearth the secret
of Sabaramond together.

271
00:14:42,676 --> 00:14:45,136
By joining forces.

272
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:48,156
So

273
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:52,456
you want to know about
a fate that spans a hundred years?

274
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,576
Can I ask you a little more about that?

275
00:14:54,876 --> 00:14:57,136
Well, let's say

276
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:00,296
someone committed some unforgivable crime.

277
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,816
Do you think those relationships

278
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,556
should be cursed by the world
and face judgment?

279
00:15:10,616 --> 00:15:13,216
This is just my personal feeling.

280
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:17,256
I'd like to think
this world isn't like that.

281
00:15:17,636 --> 00:15:20,636
I see. Well, usually that's the case.

282
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,236
There are, however,
some troublesome people

283
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:26,836
who still hate my friends
and me for things

284
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:30,176
that happened a hundred years ago.

285
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:34,536
That's terrible.

286
00:15:34,876 --> 00:15:36,876
If there's anything I can do,

287
00:15:37,116 --> 00:15:39,756
allow me to offer whatever help I am able.

288
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:42,316
"Terrible"?

289
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:44,916
It's the other way around, Mr. Diviner.

290
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:50,716
I want to encounter those unreasonable
guys as soon as possible.

291
00:15:50,876 --> 00:15:51,796
Huh?

292
00:15:51,996 --> 00:15:53,356
Think about it.

293
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,536
The reason we're kicked down,

294
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:56,936
the reason we're despised,

295
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:58,436
the reason we're hated,

296
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:01,716
or the reason why we've
earned their malice…

297
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:05,256
The more unreasonable, the better.

298
00:16:06,356 --> 00:16:08,096
What do you mean?

299
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:10,676
I don't owe those people anything, right?

300
00:16:11,036 --> 00:16:14,796
Then, I can crush insects
with a clear conscience.

301
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:17,736
And there will be no guilt at all.

302
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:21,076
Isn't that…

303
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:25,056
doing the same thing as your adversary?

304
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:28,656
Yes, so it's about
the order of operations.

305
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:32,036
CRIME
If my friend committed the wrong-doing first

306
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,456
and the adversary sought revenge
against just that friend,

307
00:16:34,456 --> 00:16:36,096
they would have every right to do so.

308
00:16:36,476 --> 00:16:39,696
But if the adversary hates me

309
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:43,736
for the sole reason that
I am related to the wrongdoer,

310
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:46,156
that starts a whole new attack.

311
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:50,016
If so, should I not, in turn, be allowed

312
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:52,036
to make a move against
my adversary's friends?

313
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,936
Well, it's not the same.

314
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:57,456
Once I can pass undetected
by the eyes of the law,

315
00:16:57,536 --> 00:17:01,116
I can pursue any destruction
by insult to maximum effect.

316
00:17:01,376 --> 00:17:05,196
Don't you think that would feel wonderful?

317
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:08,836
He's different from those kids.

318
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:10,696
Those children

319
00:17:10,856 --> 00:17:13,016
were killed for no reason
when they were with me back then.

320
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:16,516
He's not like them.

321
00:17:17,376 --> 00:17:19,396
Allow me to ask you one thing.

322
00:17:19,736 --> 00:17:21,896
Do you mean

323
00:17:22,096 --> 00:17:23,776
everything you just said?

324
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:25,556
What do you think?

325
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:27,596
Maybe you should try divining it to see?

326
00:17:29,276 --> 00:17:31,536
Very well. Let's do that.

327
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,216
What is it? Lulu.

328
00:17:49,216 --> 00:17:51,436
Huh? I don't want to do
the fortune telling anymore.

329
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:52,956
Hmm? Huh?

330
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:54,996
-I'm sorry, I'm going to have to cancel for today.
-I have to get home.

331
00:17:54,996 --> 00:17:56,676
Huh? Huh?

332
00:18:00,336 --> 00:18:03,476
He hasn't figured out what I'm doing.

333
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:09,076
At least he doesn't have
the Evil Eye to see ghosts and the dead.

334
00:18:09,576 --> 00:18:10,976
In that case,

335
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:16,196
I'll give his senses a shake

336
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:18,436
and touch his soul directly.

337
00:18:19,476 --> 00:18:22,536
Calm your heart and entrust it

338
00:18:23,056 --> 00:18:24,756
to the fluctuations of this space.

339
00:18:30,216 --> 00:18:31,896
These spirits

340
00:18:32,536 --> 00:18:34,456
are trying to protect?

341
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,516
It's the first time I've felt this.

342
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:49,476
The magic in my body just burst.

343
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,156
What just happened to me?

344
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,756
Could it be that

345
00:18:54,256 --> 00:18:57,936
this boy is a visitor from another world?

346
00:18:59,236 --> 00:19:02,016
What's with this dense magic power?

347
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,996
It's on par with
the imperial court sorcerers?

348
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:09,336
Is he really even a human of this world?

349
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:12,636
But I have investigated Polka Shinoyama.

350
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:15,756
He is undoubtedly a human
born in this world.

351
00:19:16,416 --> 00:19:17,776
so is he a stand-in?

352
00:19:18,196 --> 00:19:19,916
Perhaps he's from the other side of sky?

353
00:19:20,396 --> 00:19:23,436
Or maybe there could be
someone manipulating him?

354
00:19:24,356 --> 00:19:25,516
Interesting.

355
00:19:26,316 --> 00:19:28,076
What an incredible feeling.

356
00:19:28,496 --> 00:19:31,636
Just now, did you do something to me?

357
00:19:32,396 --> 00:19:36,016
Well. It could have been that dormant fate

358
00:19:36,156 --> 00:19:38,516
within you awakening.

359
00:19:39,676 --> 00:19:43,756
Please allow me to
search your soul a little deeper.

360
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,976
I need to figure out a safe way
to get through this.

361
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:48,876
But it was so close.

362
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:50,496
Hmm…

363
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,796
I can't wait to see what comes out of it.

364
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,836
I too am eager to know

365
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:58,516
what's lurking inside me.

366
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:01,956
You might be happier

367
00:20:02,656 --> 00:20:05,056
not knowing about your true self.

368
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:06,576
Lord Civil!

369
00:20:07,116 --> 00:20:08,716
I received a guidance!

370
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:10,636
This place is dangerous!

371
00:20:10,756 --> 00:20:12,396
Who is this young girl?

372
00:20:13,116 --> 00:20:15,276
A very high-ranked stone elf…

373
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:18,536
BYANDY EMPIRE CHANCELLOR, LEUF VELLIZE
Is this the child?

374
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:21,116
To be sold while still so young.

375
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:25,736
His family should naturally
be able to see elves.

376
00:20:26,136 --> 00:20:28,796
But apparently,
the Evil Eye was too much for them.

377
00:20:29,396 --> 00:20:33,016
You're only able to hear
the voices of elves, right?

378
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:34,536
Honorable Chancellor?

379
00:20:35,716 --> 00:20:38,856
The Evil Eye is simultaneously
both the eyes and the ears.

380
00:20:39,636 --> 00:20:43,016
It must be much harder for you than
it is for us, who have only one of them.

381
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:47,136
But you should live on in strength.

382
00:20:47,716 --> 00:20:49,456
For elf and spirits of the dead alike

383
00:20:49,636 --> 00:20:53,616
are constant companions at our side.

384
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:56,556
So that's it.

385
00:20:57,016 --> 00:20:59,756
We were just getting to the good part.
You can't take care of it for me?

386
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:01,716
But guidance…

387
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:05,156
Quit it, boss.
Lulu's ears are never wrong.

388
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:08,316
The color of that woman's soul…

389
00:21:08,356 --> 00:21:12,616
The bugs might be setting
fire to this place.

390
00:21:12,756 --> 00:21:15,916
Bugs? Is she referring to
Fire-breathing Bug?

391
00:21:16,156 --> 00:21:17,416
Oh, rather than that…

392
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:20,396
If it were just one,
I'd be able to call it a coincidence.

393
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:24,836
But there are three of them, deeply clad
in the colors of my former world.

394
00:21:25,556 --> 00:21:27,296
Then it is inevitable.

395
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:30,216
These three have come to see me.

396
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:32,696
They are the vanguards
from the other world.

397
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:36,676
Even though I had my spirits of the dead
lead out all the customers…

398
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,056
What to do?

399
00:21:38,216 --> 00:21:39,276
Should I keep them here?

400
00:21:39,396 --> 00:21:41,396
Come on, hurry up and leave.

401
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,676
Sorry, Mr. Diviner.

402
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:45,856
I will come see you again.

403
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:46,956
Next time,

404
00:21:47,156 --> 00:21:48,536
it'll be as a friend.

405
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:54,056
Miss Soara!

406
00:21:59,596 --> 00:22:00,816
It's you, isn't it?

407
00:22:01,056 --> 00:22:04,156
You're the assailant who's been
showing up all over the place lately.

408
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:40,002
