1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,140
I'm dying.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,320
Why would Nishida miss work for no reason?

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,820
Ugh! No more!

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,660
Good job.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,380
You'll be getting a bonus,
so I hope you can forgive him.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,780
A bonus?

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:19,800
Yes.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,000
And here's something from me.

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you very much.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,600
He's getting a drink from Clarissa.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,860
How lucky.

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,040
A bonus.

13
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,340
Now I can buy a bunch of photo books.

14
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,560
Can someone check in on
Nishida apartment for me?

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,860
Just to be safe, make it a group of two.

16
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:59,920
(Dead Mount, Death Play)

17
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,009
(Episode 14: The Corpse)

18
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,400
The world's ending, Mr. Higuro.

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,320
What era hasn't been
"the end" of something?

20
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,640
I mean, even I'm having to act
as a middleman in Shibuya.

21
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,600
Fine, then it's just getting
"better and better".

22
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,280
I think it's on a one-way
track to deterioration.

23
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,260
Still, I honestly can't believe
what Solitaire said was right on the mark.

24
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,780
Someone from the police
asked me to shot Solitaire.

25
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,900
I didn't expect some bad police
would ask this of me.

26
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,920
What should I do?
I can't trust the police anymore.

27
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,180
Ah, my head spins.

28
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,840
There're so many people
on Shinjuku's camera.

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:12,400
In this situation, we can't possibly
find Solitaire.

30
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,120
If Solitaire disguised himself,
this could all be for nothing.

31
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,160
Yeah.

32
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,160
But knowing Solitaire's personality,

33
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,880
chances are he'll return to that building.

34
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,580
But why did he go to that building?

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,220
Does he realize Polka Shinoyama
knows about that mark?

36
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,400
Either way, I need to see Polka Shinoyama
one more time.

37
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,000
Wow, such a ridiculously tall guy!

38
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,480
Look at this.

39
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,700
Wow, he's over two meters tall.

40
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,740
So, I wasn't mistaken.

41
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,500
You know him?

42
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,500
No. I'm talking about the guy next to him.

43
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,640
Oh, isn't that…

44
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,240
He was affiliated with an organization
I took out a few years ago.

45
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,200
Sorry, we have to focus
on finding Solitaire.

46
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,780
But he is related.

47
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,820
Polka Shinoyama's friend, Takumi Kuruya.

48
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,360
A former member of "the gang Sons
of the Styx", a criminal gang.

49
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,020
THE GANG SONS OF THE STYX
Even though I eliminated this gang,

50
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,680
one member managed to escape.

51
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,820
Higuro, the gang's former leader.

52
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,520
Sir, why don't you donate
some money to our cause?

53
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,480
Although we didn't find the body,
we ended up with a bonus.

54
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,380
Oh, I have a question.

55
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,380
Ugh, what is it?

56
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,240
Do you have any patron?

57
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,280
Huh?

58
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,740
Patron. You know.

59
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,020
Like contacts. Connections.

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,840
I believe connections are love.

61
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,480
What I want to know is, are you loved?

62
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,500
What is this guy talking about?

63
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,860
Are any of your friends or family members

64
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,460
politicians or big-shot cops?

65
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,940
Any legendary mercenaries? Superheroes?

66
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,160
World-renowned Karate masters?

67
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,720
Even an ordinary person will do.

68
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,620
You have anyone who loves you so much,
that they'd risk their life for you?

69
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,320
Is he on something?

70
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,980
Is he out of his mind?

71
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,000
In that case, if we kill him,
we'll be doing the cops favor, eh?

72
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,380
So there's nobody in your lives like that?

73
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,260
No, idiot.

74
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,700
How about I find you someone
from the funeral business.

75
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,620
I already have someone like that.

76
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,540
Even though they are outlaws.

77
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,280
Do you know why you're going to die?

78
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,040
Is it because you guys are still
causing trouble in this place at this hour?

79
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,620
Or is it because you shamelessly
flaunt your violence against women?

80
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,080
Is it because you guys
are picking a fight with us?

81
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,600
No, that's not the answer.

82
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,680
If you guys had contacts,
I wouldn't kill you.

83
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,960
Contacts are love.

84
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,480
But when that love turns into hatred,
it makes things tricky.

85
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,680
If you had some dangerous contacts,
I would have been hesitant to upset them.

86
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,180
N-No, I am sorry.

87
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,880
S-Spare me.

88
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,660
You guys have no contacts.

89
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,560
So nobody's going to save you.

90
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,740
You are too concerned about connections.

91
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,880
Some time ago,

92
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,720
someone I meddled with had
an especially dangerous ally on his side.

93
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,260
I managed to get away,

94
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,860
but the entire organization was decimated.

95
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,300
What if they're the sons of some
super-powerful politician or something?

96
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
I'd just go into hiding for a while again.

97
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,880
See? Told you the world was ending.

98
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,880
After all, a lowlife like you
is freely roaming the streets.

99
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,440
That's why it's always "the end."

100
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,380
Even this will come to a close soon.

101
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,320
This world is on the brink of a new dawn.

102
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,000
This way.

103
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,260
It would be nice if the passage wasn't
destroyed five years ago.

104
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,000
Ah, I feel so dizzy.

105
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,720
What time is it now?

106
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,160
Where did I leave my phone?

107
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,680
Oh, there's Urai.

108
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,440
I guess his shift's already over.

109
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,120
Hey, Urai. Can you hear me?

110
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,860
Huh?

111
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,780
Huh? Huh? What's going on?

112
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,820
I remember…

113
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,960
IMPROVE YOUR LUCK, FORTUNES
Good morning.

114
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,780
Thank you for letting me interview.

115
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,640
Please tell the fortune
of this person I've brought.

116
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,020
Hello.

117
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,460
This is Mr. A, an average citizen
in the neighborhood.

118
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,980
Thanks for having me.

119
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,980
We know this guy.

120
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,860
He's a bartender at Clarissa's place!

121
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,840
What's he doing?

122
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,500
Hehe, first, we start with a quick jab.

123
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,480
This guy's affiliated with
the owner of this building.

124
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,760
Let's see how he reacts.

125
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,260
I came because I thought
it's a part-time job.

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,620
So how did I end up here getting
my fortune told by Polka?

127
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,260
Uh, hello.

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,220
Oh, he doesn't remember me.

129
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,260
But Misaki should remember.

130
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,280
Nice to meet you.

131
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,840
They both didn't recognize him?

132
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,060
I'll just pretend this is
our first-time meeting.

133
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,060
Is anything troubling you?

134
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,740
Uh, troubling me?

135
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,800
I want to complain about work!

136
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,360
But if word of this got back to the bar…

137
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,780
-Waah!
-I'll be dead in that case.

138
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,560
O-Oh, right.

139
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,640
My shoulder's been really stiff lately.

140
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,060
No, no.

141
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,820
I didn't come here to get
a chiropractic adjustment.

142
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,120
I see.

143
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,780
Oh yeah!

144
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:15,980
Actually, my coworker skipped work
and went off somewhere.

145
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,240
I was wondering if you might be able
to divine where he went.

146
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,620
Is this coworker of yours,
someone important to you?

147
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,620
Huh? No.

148
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,960
I wouldn't say he's like family,

149
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,520
but I guess he's a friend
I can talk openly with.

150
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,260
Huh? No way. Hold on…

151
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,440
CLOSE
I have something to report to you.

152
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,140
It seems that Mr. Nishida has been to
this building before.

153
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,860
Nishida was here.

154
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,100
The building's surveillance camera shows
Nishida left in a hurry,

155
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,780
with his uniform still on.

156
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,980
He was kidnapped?

157
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,560
What for?

158
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,200
It's quite suspicious.

159
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,480
The timing of all this bugs me.

160
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,540
FLOCK OF HANDS APPEAR IN SHINJUKU
Is this related to Polka?

161
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,280
So Nishida's been captured
and is being tortured

162
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,820
to spill what he knows about Polka?

163
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,980
No. Nishida doesn't know
anything about Polka.

164
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,800
The only bartender who does is…

165
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,200
No way.

166
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,520
I know Polka is a necromancer. But…

167
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,140
Eeek! Why did they call me in here?

168
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,060
It can't be…

169
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,500
Your friend

170
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,400
may have gotten mixed up
in some serious trouble.

171
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,600
Ahhh! Ah…Ah!

172
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:39,360
You can see-ee-ee me-ee?

173
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,600
Please-ase.

174
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,120
Tell-ell him-im…

175
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,080
Someone-one-one killed-illed me-ee-ee.

176
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,160
Um… Trouble?

177
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,140
What kind of reaction is this?

178
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,100
What the heck is going on here?

179
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,080
Clarissa.

180
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,920
We have additional info on Mr. Nishida.

181
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,420
What is it?

182
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,180
Clarissa, we have a slight problem.

183
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,380
The police are here, aren't they?

184
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,640
They want to confirm whether
or not Nishida is an employee here?

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,880
Do you have superpowers?

186
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,280
Huh? You got it all right?

187
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,840
They're awfully good at their job.

188
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,840
This is just like what happened
with Mr. Hosorogi back then.

189
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,540
Now, then.

190
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,800
Let's hope this time
we're able to find it easily.

191
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,200
An honest heart-to-heart?

192
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,820
But what am I

193
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,540
supposed to say to
that fake Polka? And how?

194
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,860
And if Lady Sayo were to
find out my true identity…

195
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,560
Your family members are assassins?

196
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,180
Does that have anything to do with sharks?

197
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,200
Actually, I doubt she'd really mind.

198
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,960
The police?

199
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,100
If this is about Solitaire,

200
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,060
I'm involved, so this could be bad for me.

201
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,980
All right.

202
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,200
So we're going to
press them about the Solitaire case.

203
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:19,260
If Takumi Kuruya's inside,
this should go quickly.

204
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,840
And I've got a good feeling he is.

205
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,160
Don't get too excited.

206
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,420
Excuse us.

207
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,480
Oh!

208
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,600
Hold on a sec!

209
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,080
Who are you?

210
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,500
Jurisdictional police?

211
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,940
What about you guys?

212
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,800
We're working on a case
under headquarters' jurisdiction.

213
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,440
I must ask you to leave.

214
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,080
No can do.

215
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm also one of the officers in charge
of the Solitaire investigation.

216
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,000
It has nothing to do
with the Solitaire case.

217
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,920
Our orders are from the top.

218
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,020
It happened last night.
A real ugly mugging in the street.

219
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,220
We got a lead that a suspected
mugger is hiding in this building.

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,220
The guy works at a bar around here.

221
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,940
It's called Youtoukorou.

222
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,800
You community safety division
has not heard of it?

223
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,480
Oh. It's started.

224
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,020
Why is he here?

225
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,200
Oh, you know one of them?

226
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,420
It's the detective who destroyed that
organization I told you about yesterday.

227
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,580
No way we can go about this

228
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,520
only with the info that
came down from above.

229
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,260
You're not wrong.

230
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,120
And Agakura failed several times
due to not having enough info.

231
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,760
But I personally enjoy when that happens.

232
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,020
Maybe I ought to find out
whatever I can myself.

233
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,120
You got a contact?

234
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,980
Back in the day, one of our guys
was a really capable intelligence dealer.

235
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,280
But now he's with
a business rival in Shinjuku.

236
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,320
STOP. THE COPS ARE HERE

237
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,800
Damn it! They are not from
the Shinjuku Police Station.

238
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,060
SORRY, I SCREWED UP.
JUST DO WHATEVER I SAY…

239
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,560
Huh? What?

240
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,200
Coming.

241
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
We are the police.

242
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,880
Who's in charge here?

243
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,960
If you mean who's in charge of
this fortune-telling business, that's me.

244
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,900
We're launching
a full investigation of this building.

245
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,860
If you could,
please evacuate the premises.

246
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,520
Do you recognize this face?

247
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,440
This man is suspected of a mugging.

248
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,640
Ah-ah-ah! That is-is me-ee-ee.

249
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,200
No.

250
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,760
We received info that
he hid in this building,

251
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,840
so we'd appreciate your cooperation
with our investigation.

252
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,300
Understood.

253
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,120
N-No! I-I didn't do it-it!

254
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,480
A mugging? At this time of day?

255
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,640
And the mugger ran into the very
same building Solitaire appeared in?

256
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,060
Is there some connection?

257
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,420
I want to look into
the identity of the mugger.

258
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Could you show me
the photo of that mugger too?

259
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,880
Are you involved?

260
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,700
Yes.

261
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,840
Huh? Wait…

262
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,340
Polka, Polka.

263
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,820
Can you use your magic to scope out
the basement of this building right away?

264
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,160
Why?

265
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,140
I have got a bad feeling.

266
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,180
This whole thing feels familiar.

267
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,000
It's like the thing happened right after
I was killed here five years ago.

268
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,440
If my hunch is correct, there's something
down in the basement.

269
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,600
I've found it already.

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,820
What is it?

271
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,420
In the basement, it's the corpse of
that man named Nishida.

272
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,320
This is bad.
If they find that in the basement,

273
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,720
I can bid my peaceful
and quiet life farewell.

274
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,680
I see.

275
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,640
Unless it concerns children or
your associates, you're really apathetic.

276
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,500
You're too gentle when you dole out death.

277
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,320
That's why you must
create clearer boundaries.

278
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Neither underestimate nor
overestimate your power's reach.

279
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,540
Otherwise, you will lose a lot of things.

280
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,340
Yes, I won't deny it.

281
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,160
But…

282
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,240
No-o! It-t wasn't me-ee!

283
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,860
I feel that, as I am now,

284
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,720
my hands will reach further still.

285
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,780
There is nothing.

286
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,440
Looks like an empty room.

287
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,500
I was sure it was hidden here.

288
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,480
Find anything?

289
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,940
No, sir. He wasn't down there.

290
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,940
I see.

291
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,640
What is it?

292
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,720
Uh, nothing.

293
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,820
It's just, maybe he's up above.

294
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,160
It's also possible he's already fled.

295
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,220
If he's not in this building,

296
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,140
we'll check the neighborhood
surveillance cameras.

297
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,380
Y-Yes, sir.

298
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:49,800
The big shop at Sakuradamon
started to restock?

299
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,720
The market in Shinjuku
is going to be in chaos.

300
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,580
The assassin market will fluctuate now.

301
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,900
The police?

302
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,000
At the building where Polka's staying?

303
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,580
They're not local detectives.

304
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,240
They are probably from headquarters.

305
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,580
Where are Polka and his friends?

306
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,060
Outside.

307
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,600
It's a good thing the rain stopped.

308
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,880
You're scared, aren't you, darling?

309
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,220
Yeah.

310
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,300
A secret passage below the basement floor?

311
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,980
I discovered it while I was searching
the building that night.

312
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,880
It looks to be connected to
another building somewhere,

313
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,680
but since it didn't appear to
have been used for a while,

314
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,000
I didn't give it any thought.

315
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,820
Secret passages were
pretty common in the Empire.

316
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,000
I did figure out one thing, though.

317
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,180
Somebody is trying to ensnare
this building in a trap.

318
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,280
Their objective is either us,

319
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,600
or,

320
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,140
the building's owner, Clarissa.

321
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,260
Yep. Looks like he was in there after all.

322
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,860
Takumi Kuruya.

323
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,780
Aren't you going to go over there?

324
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,180
I really want to.

325
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,420
But there's Miss Kochou.

326
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:05,160
She's a reporter with
Weekly Dry now, right?

327
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,540
She seems to be doing an interview
on Polka Shinoyama.

328
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,620
Since they came right out without a fight,

329
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,260
maybe we should hang back
and watch them for now.

330
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,320
The uniformed officers who came along
with the guy from headquarters…

331
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,120
Isn't he from our Shinjuku branch office?

332
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,880
Headquarters coming here on
a mugging case smell fishy to me.

333
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,820
And to suggest

334
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,460
one of Clarissa's workers would flee

335
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,900
into Clarissa's own building?

336
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,540
Makes me wonder who tipped them off.

337
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,640
You're saying it was fake information?

338
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,400
The timing's just too good.

339
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,320
I wouldn't even be surprised to
find out it was Solitaire's doing, but…

340
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,100
It's the same as five years ago.

341
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,660
Mr. Hosorogi had been missing for some
time when I got an email from him saying,

342
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,360
FROM: HOSOROGI, RECIPIENT: IWA
"I found some crucial evidence here."

343
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,140
Mr. Hosorogi?

344
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,280
By the time I got here, there was nothing.

345
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,380
Apart from a bloodstain on the wall.

346
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,100
That matched Mr. Hosorogi's DNA.

347
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,120
I see.

348
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,700
Kozaburo Arase.

349
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,260
If he's involved,

350
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,720
I'll have to disguise myself better.

351
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,180
Just a hat won't cut it.

352
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,440
Mr. Momoya? What is it?

353
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,660
There's such a thing as destiny.

354
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,160
What on earth is going on?

355
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,500
What are you doing here?

356
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:37,640
Taipei.

357
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:41,120
Your job is to guard
the young lady, remember?

358
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,400
Yes.

359
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,180
You don't have to remind me. I'll go back.

360
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,040
You have no further value
to the Lei family.

361
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,140
Carrying out your duty to
protect her to your death.

362
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,880
You don't have to tell me.

363
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,480
The Lei family is no longer
of concern to me.

364
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,540
I have no reason to listen to
your bragging in front of me.

365
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,940
Are you sure?

366
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,620
If you have no further
connection with the family,

367
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,160
you'll be nothing.

368
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
I think you need to learn how
to control that mouth of yours.

369
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,740
Let go of me, Taipei.

370
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,840
Yoo hoo!

371
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,420
M-Miss Sakimiya!

372
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,500
Are these groceries?
I'll carry them for you!

373
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,060
Oh, no, that's okay.

374
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:25,560
Things are a bit of a mess
at the building right now.

375
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,920
Um…

376
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,160
New shark merch!

377
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,260
I'm glad you like it.

378
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,200
Buy me more!

379
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,180
Sorry.

380
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,060
TO MY BELOVED LITTLE BROTHER, NO MATTER
WHAT FATHER AND THAT OVERGROWN JERK SAY,

381
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,840
I, AT LEAST WILL ALWAYS
LOOOOOVE YOU, XIAOYU.

382
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,380
Can I help you?

383
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,880
Don't worry.

384
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,380
I'm on the Shinoyama family's side.

385
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:04,680
An ally of the Shinoyama
doesn't mean an ally of Polka.

386
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,720
It's Shinjuku.

387
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,640
And it's packed with all sorts of people.

388
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,220
So you'd better be careful.

389
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,760
What is this?

390
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,360
This weak aura of life she has.

391
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,980
All sorts of people?

392
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,760
I see.

393
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,780
So it really is a den of thieves.

394
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,040
Who is that girl?

395
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,800
She's no amateur.

396
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,040
She has probably killed
at least ten people.

397
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,960
That girl is probably
one of Shinjuku's assassins.

398
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,080
Is that so?

399
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,020
Kozaburo Arase.

400
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,580
The son of the Shinoyama family.

401
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,720
Members of the Lei family.

402
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,600
And Takumi Kuruya.

403
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,120
I didn't expect they would all be here.

404
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,140
I was afraid this would be a boring job,
but I'm glad I was wrong.

405
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,000
I think this will turn out
to be very, very fun work.
