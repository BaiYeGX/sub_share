1
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:16,275
Well, well.

2
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:18,735
A secret compartment.

3
00:00:19,495 --> 00:00:23,015
Looks like my hunch was right.

4
00:00:23,995 --> 00:00:27,135
Who could be calling?

5
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:31,535
Perhaps it's the assassin who shot at me?

6
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:36,435
Your hunch?

7
00:00:36,695 --> 00:00:37,515
Now I know for sure.

8
00:00:37,635 --> 00:00:42,215
You came here without any evidence
just to trick me into giving you answers.

9
00:00:44,935 --> 00:00:46,035
And if that's true?

10
00:00:46,215 --> 00:00:48,875
Acting like you don't care
isn't going to trick me.

11
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,075
But

12
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:54,015
you can be of some use to me.

13
00:00:54,915 --> 00:00:55,835
Answer it.

14
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:58,535
This isn't a bomb, right?

15
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:01,115
Hit the red button to pick up.

16
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,775
Here goes nothing!

17
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,795
Are you busy?

18
00:01:08,255 --> 00:01:09,415
That voice…

19
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:11,675
No, it's no problem.

20
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:15,035
Give him the information.

21
00:01:15,835 --> 00:01:17,175
Well, well.

22
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,255
And one who already has
a considerable tie to my shop.

23
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:23,615
Thank you for your patronage.

24
00:01:24,255 --> 00:01:25,435
Lord Solitaire.

25
00:01:26,115 --> 00:01:27,215
The Grocer!

26
00:01:27,955 --> 00:01:28,895
So,

27
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:30,655
how are things going?

28
00:01:31,495 --> 00:01:34,295
All the items you requested have come in.

29
00:01:34,955 --> 00:01:37,495
The complete internal phone records
of the Police Department.

30
00:01:37,975 --> 00:01:41,875
There are two pieces of information
that will interest you.

31
00:01:43,075 --> 00:01:45,275
The first is in
the present progressive form.

32
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:47,815
Inspector Tsubaki Iwanome

33
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:51,575
is talking with someone believed
to be former inspector Hosorogi.

34
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:54,315
Hosorogi!

35
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:56,475
I didn't expect to hear that name here.

36
00:01:57,175 --> 00:01:59,915
I see. So he's alive.

37
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:03,355
I'll deliver the call log to you later.

38
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:05,135
Another piece of information is

39
00:02:05,615 --> 00:02:10,395
a number of incoming calls from
a middleman in Shibuya to Inspector Habaki.

40
00:02:10,575 --> 00:02:12,835
Just as I thought.

41
00:02:12,935 --> 00:02:14,015
Good work.

42
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:15,735
Thanks for your patronage.

43
00:02:18,635 --> 00:02:21,155
So you have a direct line to The Grocer.

44
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,035
Can you sell it to me?

45
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:25,135
No.

46
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:29,815
Still, I'd heard you were a broad-minded
man, but this takes the cake.

47
00:02:30,615 --> 00:02:34,235
The superintendent general personally
instructed a criminal to wiretap someone.

48
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:35,955
Isn't it obvious?

49
00:02:36,495 --> 00:02:38,595
Why else do you think I'd grant
so much liberty to a criminal,

50
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:42,415
even if it's just a single individual?

51
00:02:43,735 --> 00:02:44,835
Alright.

52
00:02:45,115 --> 00:02:47,995
I've told you the name of
the person behind the scenes.

53
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:52,115
The location of Inspector Habaki
is also under surveillance.

54
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:56,035
It's up to you how
that information is used.

55
00:02:56,835 --> 00:02:58,135
I see.

56
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:01,955
So you can keep your own hands
clean by putting me to work?

57
00:03:02,155 --> 00:03:03,855
You're after the mastermind

58
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:07,775
who tried to have you killed
and whatever lies beyond, right?

59
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:10,815
One more thing.

60
00:03:11,195 --> 00:03:13,295
Of course, I will pay.

61
00:03:14,335 --> 00:03:15,615
What else do you want?

62
00:03:16,695 --> 00:03:20,875
I want Inspector Tsubaki Iwanome's
cell phone number.

63
00:03:25,755 --> 00:03:26,655
Solitaire?

64
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:35,135
Takumi?

65
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,675
Oh! Finally got through!

66
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,835
We will talk about the details later.

67
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:40,375
Keep an eye on your surroundings.

68
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:42,955
We wish to return as soon as possible too,

69
00:03:43,395 --> 00:03:44,855
but we'll be a little late.

70
00:03:46,695 --> 00:03:47,655
What?

71
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,855
How I miss

72
00:03:51,115 --> 00:03:54,315
my hometown.

73
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:59,555
It's extremely sloppy to say the name
of your contact over the phone.

74
00:04:00,215 --> 00:04:01,355
Inspector Habaki.

75
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:03,775
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:05,135
You just called

77
00:04:05,335 --> 00:04:07,115
the person
over the phone, "Higuro," didn't you?

78
00:04:07,335 --> 00:04:10,655
Why would you be talking
to the middleman in Shibuya?

79
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:12,635
Well…

80
00:04:12,635 --> 00:04:13,475
And

81
00:04:14,015 --> 00:04:15,995
what was that about "Sabaramond"?

82
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:20,775
I really felt like
I owed you one, you know.

83
00:04:22,435 --> 00:04:24,415
Wait, Sabaramond is…

84
00:04:27,995 --> 00:04:29,015
Sabara…

85
00:04:29,755 --> 00:04:30,895
Mond…

86
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:32,415
Said it.

87
00:04:32,695 --> 00:04:34,095
Said it, indeed.

88
00:04:34,635 --> 00:04:36,115
What's with these guys?

89
00:04:36,255 --> 00:04:40,975
Said it.

90
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:42,835
Said it, indeed.

91
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:45,795
Said it.

92
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:47,515
Saiiiiiiid…

93
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:55,775
Is everything well with my old friends?

94
00:04:57,115 --> 00:05:01,095
Sabaramond… Said it.

95
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:07,095
No mistake about it…it…

96
00:05:11,135 --> 00:05:13,435
Product.

97
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:24,416
(Dead Mount, Death Play)

98
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:47,668
(Episode 17: The Matriarch)

99
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:50,248
Product…duct…

100
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:52,448
Sabaramond'ssssss…

101
00:06:52,448 --> 00:06:54,448
Productttt…

102
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:55,588
Leader.

103
00:06:57,888 --> 00:06:58,848
Whoa, whoa.

104
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:00,148
Is this for real?

105
00:07:01,048 --> 00:07:03,488
Leader, these people are really lucky.

106
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:07,688
First Lemmings, then Solitaire,
and now Fire-breathing Bug.

107
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:10,028
This is what they call

108
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,288
getting the joker.

109
00:07:12,768 --> 00:07:13,728
THIS WORLD IS A BUGGY PROGRAM
Darn it.

110
00:07:15,388 --> 00:07:17,408
When the wind blows.

111
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,028
When the rain falls.

112
00:07:20,368 --> 00:07:23,668
My heart remains the same.

113
00:07:24,628 --> 00:07:26,368
My hometown,

114
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:28,528
I can't forget you.

115
00:07:29,328 --> 00:07:30,288
Right?

116
00:07:33,308 --> 00:07:34,448
Please drop away.

117
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:35,788
Please stand back.

118
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:38,328
All you weak little bugs.

119
00:07:39,128 --> 00:07:41,908
My silly little brother is not a product.

120
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:45,868
And even if you light it on fire,
the world won't be singed at all.

121
00:07:46,788 --> 00:07:48,388
I won't help you.

122
00:07:48,848 --> 00:07:49,928
I won't try to stop you either.

123
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:53,608
All I will do is pity you,

124
00:07:53,948 --> 00:07:55,128
and pray for you.

125
00:07:56,648 --> 00:08:00,428
For your everlasting revenge.

126
00:08:02,128 --> 00:08:04,328
Leave this place, please.

127
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,828
In the name of Agakura Majiri.

128
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:21,408
What was that just now?

129
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:22,968
You know these people, Maa?

130
00:08:23,328 --> 00:08:26,208
Yeah, you could call them friends.

131
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:31,528
There's no use meddling
with people dressed in that rain gear.

132
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:33,828
No matter how many you stamp out,

133
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:36,228
there's just no end to them.

134
00:08:40,768 --> 00:08:41,848
Who are these guys?

135
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:44,648
It's like they don't even see us.

136
00:08:44,748 --> 00:08:47,368
They've got quite
the grudge against Habaki.

137
00:08:47,488 --> 00:08:50,648
Not yet. This can't be the end.

138
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:52,208
Mr. Iwa.

139
00:08:52,488 --> 00:08:54,168
These guys are moving strangely.

140
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:57,788
You want to know the secret
of Fire-breathing Bug's tricks?

141
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,288
Yes.

142
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:01,848
Since you don't want to show up,

143
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,748
then I want to hear
what your remuneration is.

144
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,528
I'll only give you a hint.

145
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:13,308
Fire-breathing Bug is one person,
but not just one person.

146
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:17,668
They're as close as it gets to being someone
with supernatural powers, or even a wizard,

147
00:09:18,028 --> 00:09:23,888
but they're simply the personification
of the fruits of technology.

148
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:30,788
It can't be…?

149
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,488
Arase!

150
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:35,108
Get the fire extinguisher!

151
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:39,468
Got it.

152
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:40,568
Hello.

153
00:09:40,828 --> 00:09:43,168
Why are you targeted
by the Fire-breathing Bug?

154
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:44,548
Darn it.

155
00:09:45,028 --> 00:09:45,988
Good grief.

156
00:09:46,568 --> 00:09:48,748
Solitaire is enough.

157
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:53,608
You guys are like gamma knives.

158
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:55,188
What does that mean?

159
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,688
You're firing gamma rays
in all directions.

160
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:01,568
Just like a medical device
that removes lesions.

161
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:04,928
You send your punishing fire

162
00:10:04,928 --> 00:10:11,688
all along this line we call a clue,
consuming any sinners we find there.

163
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:16,868
But if you misfire,
it can cause a miscarriage of justice.

164
00:10:20,388 --> 00:10:23,688
Sometimes what
that nasty sir says comes in handy.

165
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:27,848
So the Fire-breathing Bug is probably
using lasers or some other method

166
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,588
to burn the intersection…

167
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:31,148
No.

168
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,848
Is it possible to burn remote to
here accurately enough to write this?

169
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,168
That's impossible.

170
00:10:36,908 --> 00:10:37,948
Think outside the box.

171
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:40,028
Nothing is impossible.

172
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:43,388
We've taken on plenty of guys

173
00:10:44,348 --> 00:10:46,548
who defy the impossible already.

174
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:50,048
Geez.

175
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:54,308
It's about time for
the real monsters to come out!

176
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,428
Hey!

177
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,788
Let's get out of here first.

178
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:04,128
Maybe that bastard Higuro
will come back with reinforcements.

179
00:11:04,628 --> 00:11:06,408
What about this guy?

180
00:11:07,388 --> 00:11:09,028
The guys who were singing

181
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:10,628
are all gone?

182
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,608
Who on earth was…

183
00:11:14,228 --> 00:11:15,308
Someone's coming.

184
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:18,568
Might be an enemy.

185
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:24,568
Impressive.

186
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,028
He caught me.

187
00:11:26,548 --> 00:11:28,948
I thought no one would notice us.

188
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:30,568
Hmm, but

189
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:33,808
he didn't notice Maa.

190
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,548
Long time no see.

191
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:42,688
My sweet little kid-sassin.

192
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:51,828
Your current prosthetic is

193
00:11:52,528 --> 00:11:54,488
very well-made.

194
00:11:56,948 --> 00:11:59,368
But, didn't I tell you?

195
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:00,888
Sweet little boy.

196
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:03,968
If you become my little brother,

197
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:07,608
I'll give you back your arms
and legs anytime.

198
00:12:09,908 --> 00:12:10,988
So,

199
00:12:12,348 --> 00:12:14,248
you really did come back to Japan.

200
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,360
It was supposed to be an easy job.

201
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,780
They were small-timers,

202
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,340
the perfect targets for my first job.

203
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,120
But those small fries

204
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,980
were also being targeted by another group.

205
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,760
Killing anyone in the building.

206
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,620
That's the task I was given.

207
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,820
I didn't hesitate.

208
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,640
My blade cut the girl's throat.

209
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,240
She should be dead.

210
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,800
Such a strong killing intent.

211
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,960
And you're cute.

212
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,400
The latest model of killing machine
raised by the Lei family.

213
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,280
I've made up my mind.

214
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,420
Won't you let the Agakuras adopt you?

215
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,260
I didn't understand what she meant.

216
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,920
But what I truly didn't understand
was what came after.

217
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,800
The Heilei is a terribly
cruel place, isn't it?

218
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,140
You must have
an intimate understanding of that.

219
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,880
When I came to,

220
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,020
my limbs were gone.

221
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,200
Oddly enough,
there wasn't that much blood.

222
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,220
Don't worry.

223
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,840
I did it in such a way
that you wouldn't die.

224
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,080
But how will the Heilei deal with you?

225
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,700
Call my name when you need help.

226
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,260
I'll come running to your side.

227
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,760
And when that happens,
I'll give you back your limbs.

228
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,640
I'll consider you as my new family member,

229
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,780
and take good care of you.

230
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,000
Big sis is so fickle.

231
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,060
Um.

232
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,440
But it's her first time
cutting off someone else's limbs.

233
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,760
Maa must really like him.

234
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,480
Let's see each other again, okay?

235
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,680
My cute little kid-sassin.

236
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,060
My name is…

237
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,700
Agakura Majiri.

238
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,120
So

239
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,740
what'll it be?

240
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,500
You just called my name, didn't you?

241
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,580
Do you want my help?

242
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,780
Help?

243
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,940
If you become my family member,

244
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,080
I'll slaughter the Heilei
who've been so terrible to you.

245
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,620
It's true

246
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,700
I despise the Heilei.

247
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,520
However,

248
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,620
I don't hate the blood
I've inherited from them.

249
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,960
Or rather, the technology itself,
I don't hate that much.

250
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,120
And,

251
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,860
I don't belong

252
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,500
with either the Lei family
or the Agakuras.

253
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,300
My blood

254
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,700
is lightning that will protect
the Shinoyama!

255
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,980
I miscalculated.

256
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,140
I didn't expect Shinoyama to save you
before I had the chance.

257
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,760
What the heck, Majiri?

258
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,220
You've been crushing on him for close to
10 years and now you've been dumped.

259
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,920
Oh? So you're alive, Momo.

260
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,780
Big sis is so happy to see that.

261
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,800
But I don't appreciate you laughing
at your sister's broken heart.

262
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,320
I'll punish you later.

263
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,200
If you punish me now,
I could die, you know.

264
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,120
Momo ended up in
such a pitiful defeat, huh?

265
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,920
You've made quite great progress.

266
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,220
My little kid-sassin.

267
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,980
No, sis.

268
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,500
The one who did this to me
was the girl right above you.

269
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,340
Be careful, sis.

270
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,160
That girl might be a pupil of Solitaire.

271
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,300
She's got all sort of
tricks up her sleeve.

272
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,580
Momoya is just a small figure who
ranks seventh from the bottom in Agakura.

273
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,100
Isn't that just the middle level?

274
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,700
Thanks.

275
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,540
Very kind of you.

276
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,020
What's your name?

277
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,000
Misaki, Misaki Sakimiya.

278
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,140
Pleased to meet you.

279
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,660
Agakura Misaki.

280
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,560
Sounds not bad.

281
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,900
Huh?

282
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,420
Any chance you might take
on the Agakura name?

283
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
SAKIYAMA AGAKURA MISAKI
Maybe as a middle name?

284
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
No.

285
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,840
AGAKURA SAKIMIYA MISAKI
You should make the Sakimiya part your middle name.

286
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,100
What kind of stupid conversation is this?

287
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,020
Sis really can't keep
her focus on just one person.

288
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,080
There's no choice.

289
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,320
If this continues,
my very lovely brother will die.

290
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,340
Kana.

291
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,600
Yes.

292
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,760
Dahlia.

293
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,900
Dahlia.

294
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,200
Give me a weapon.

295
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,000
It's a draw today.

296
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,400
We'll get going.

297
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,700
Apologies for breaking
your prosthetic arm.

298
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,180
If you're willing to come to my house,

299
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,560
I'll make it up to you
with your original arm.

300
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,260
See you later.

301
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,120
Misaki.

302
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,240
Hey, are we just
letting them go like this?

303
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,520
I can't do anything.

304
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:06,120
That attack earlier busted one of my legs.

305
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,420
Hmm, I don't think
I can do anything either.

306
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,780
I have been stabbed by Polka before.

307
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,720
That girl

308
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,820
compared to Polka then
might be even stronger.

309
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,400
I've lost my position.

310
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,260
Get up, inspector.

311
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,080
Darn it.

312
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,520
How could the bug know my face?

313
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,100
Powder?

314
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,600
Did you just swallow that? Hey!

315
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,780
So,

316
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,960
it doesn't matter if I act up.

317
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,340
Mr. Iwa!

318
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,020
Are you alright?

319
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,880
Thanks for saving me.

320
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,840
That strength just now…

321
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,600
I can't die here.

322
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,340
Was it the effect of some kind of drug?

323
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,020
You've finally shown your true colors.

324
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,580
Hey! You're basically advertising
that your soul's pitch-black!

325
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,420
Nothing is simply black or white.

326
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:31,140
In this world, there is no color.

327
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,720
Yes.

328
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,260
Before long, he will bore a hole.

329
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,100
What are you talking about?

330
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,620
He must be crazy.

331
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
So…

332
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,580
Who should we take out first?

333
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,480
I hope Takumi and the others are okay.

334
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,080
Looks like there'll be a thunder.

335
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Thunder.

336
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,760
Hmm.

337
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,900
I though the presence of elf
was weak in this world,

338
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,700
the density of lightning elf isn't all
that different from the world I came from.

339
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,900
Thunder elf.

340
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,060
Can't you make a pact
with them to use their magic?

341
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,800
I am not an elf sorcerer.

342
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,780
It'd be suicide for anyone
other than an expert

343
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,580
in the discipline to directly take in
magic from thunder elf.

344
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:34,380
However, a few geniuses can do this.

345
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
I am quite satisfied.

346
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,960
The elves of this country are quite tasty.

347
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,840
What? I can't hear you, boss!

348
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,880
My ears are ringing from all the thunder.

349
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,100
Show a little consideration.

350
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,320
Oh, sorry.

351
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,440
This world is really interesting.

352
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,720
But it seems there are
also annoying bugs here.

353
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,100
Everyone seems to be taking action
of some kind or another.

354
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,320
Especially those hands in that building.

355
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,980
Who'd have thought they'd appear
in such a remote island country like this?

356
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:23,420
Is it something forced over
from the other side of the hole?

357
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,340
Or is it but a whim
by the destructive Wyvern Ordom?

358
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,820
Are you sure you should be showing
that mark on your back?

359
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,280
It's no need to hide it anymore, right?

360
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,920
After all, it was created by
a trickster in this country.

361
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,440
Ah!

362
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,500
I'm getting so excited now!

363
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,640
I'll have to track him down fast
and give him a proper welcoming.

364
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,700
After all, this is my first time
hosting a hometown guest.
