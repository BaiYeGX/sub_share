1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:02,528
SHINJUKU POLICE STATION

2
00:00:02,528 --> 00:00:05,280
The Gator Sisters, the Barber,

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,240
Riddle Riddle, the Grocer,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,310
the Poisoner, Donner Donner,

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,350
and the Phantom Solitaire.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,730
As you all know,
these guys were either arrested

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,310
or confirmed dead.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,880
Who came up with these strange names?

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,260
It was the leader.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,440
You two! Keep quiet!

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,170
The names don't matter anyway.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,400
They won't be made public.

13
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,080
So he cares that much.

14
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,950
In short, we cannot disclose
these guys to the public.

15
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,550
Even if we do,

16
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:38,600
the public won't believe it.
As for how to deal with them,

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,660
it's up to our "Comps-3",

18
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:43,510
that is Materials Compiling Group #3.

19
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,710
Also, there are Grim Reaper and
Fire-breathing Bug,

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,570
as well as the Lemmings.

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,130
Currently, these three calamities
are still at large.

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,550
Also, the bones were
found at the scene of fire two days ago

23
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,220
and human bodies tied up
were discovered yesterday.

24
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:02,800
We also found a footprint
at the scene of human bodies tied up.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,910
The footprint matches
that of the Lemmings.

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:07,930
And, the bones found

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,750
at the scene of fire resemble
ones of the Fire-breathing Bug case.

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,110
But we are not sure
if it is related to human bodies tied up.

29
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,220
In such a short time, two calamity-related
clues appeared simultaneously.

30
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,460
We cannot sit idly by.

31
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,730
Was that bone image synthesized?

32
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,680
After analyzing several videos,

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,930
we did not find any inconsistencies
in the angle or size of the bones.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,950
If the bones in the video
were synthesized in real-time,

35
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,480
then those videos cannot be
used as evidence.

36
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,040
Report complete.

37
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,620
If it's an illusion,

38
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,860
then the explanation given
by those children saved doesn't match.

39
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,310
Netizens on Social media platforms and
websites about supernatural phenomena

40
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,300
are now in a heated discussion.

41
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,950
Alright, calm down.

42
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,910
We've given reasonable explanations
for all the calamities we encountered.

43
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,600
Even the identity of Phantom Solitaire
has been revealed

44
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,400
with the help of advanced technology.

45
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,130
In the cases we have been responsible for,

46
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,000
there has never been a real vengeful
spirit or wizard who can summon dragons.

47
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,150
In the future, it will only be the same.

48
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,000
There must be humans behind these events.

49
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,080
As long as these events
are caused by the human,

50
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,750
we can handle it.

51
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,770
(Dead Mount, Death Play)

52
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,060
Okay, the transfer has been successful.

53
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,280
I have transferred the original soul

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,420
of Polka into this doll.

55
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,530
The drone can be returned to you now.

56
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,740
Welcome back, my lovely drone.

57
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,710
I miss you so much.

58
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,730
To be precise,

59
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,370
you should be the real Polka.

60
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,770
Sorry about that.

61
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,880
I still need to use your name
and registration for a while.

62
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,660
I won't use it for bad things.

63
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:21,170
What is this? So cute!

64
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,420
Did Polka buy it?

65
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,020
Wow, it turned so red.

66
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,950
He can still get excited
even when facing the woman who killed him.

67
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,640
Was Polka originally a strange kid?

68
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,460
I simply can't understand
what you're saying.

69
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,510
I can make it speak normally

70
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,150
as long as there is
a fresh human vocal cord.

71
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,950
That's too difficult!

72
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,750
If we start from scratch,

73
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,730
it will consume a lot of magic power.

74
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,280
Currently, perhaps I should focus on
replenishing my magic power

75
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:50,710
rather than making money.

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,260
However,

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,730
the mana content in the atmosphere
of this world is so low

78
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,110
that it's almost impossible to
sense the presence of elves.

79
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,420
How can you replenish magic power?

80
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,510
Usually, as long as there is a soul,
magic power can be replenished.

81
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,800
For the deceased to stay in
the real world,

82
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,860
it requires more energy than
you can imagine,

83
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,370
involving emotions
such as hatred or attachment.

84
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,080
As necromancers,

85
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,550
we are able to convert these emotions

86
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,600
into magic through exorcism.

87
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,370
So this building

88
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:23,550
has accumulated more powerful magic
compared with ancient battlefield.

89
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,170
However, there aren't many places

90
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,370
like this building.

91
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,620
It's okay,

92
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,730
because there are also
magic retention stones in this world.

93
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,170
Mageez litension ston?

94
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,950
Here, magic stones are called gems,

95
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
such as diamonds or sapphires.

96
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,460
In my world, they are high-density
magic retention stones.

97
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,330
If I had a bucket full of
these magic retention stones,

98
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,060
I could cast spells

99
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,420
and make a fortune here.

100
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,480
Impressive.

101
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,080
Come with me and
experience the reality for yourself.

102
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,620
Such a small piece of stone

103
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:07,910
costs the monthly salary
of a police officer in this country?

104
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,660
I didn't expect the price to be so high.

105
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,530
In your original world,
are these gems cheap?

106
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,640
Even children can buy them.

107
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,296
THE IMPERIAL GORGEOUS UNIT GUARDS YOUR LIFE! CREATING CONVENIENT LIVING WITH MAGIC CIRCUITS!
HARVEST LARGE AMOUNTS OF MAGIC RETENTION STONES FROM MAGICAL CAVES!

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,330
But in order to have a stable life,

109
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,710
I will not give up.

110
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,570
I will save enough money

111
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,150
and one day I will buy all the gems

112
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,020
in this store at once.

113
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,792
PUT THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE

114
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,930
According to market price
in the afternoon today,

115
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,770
a total of 3.8127958 billion yen
is needed.

116
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,680
I have no idea about the value of
this country's currency,

117
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,840
so I don't have much concept
about this amount of money.

118
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,150
Have a nice day.

119
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,280
I clearly sensed a strong magic
from the stone.

120
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,480
Can't you directly absorb the magic
through the cabinet?

121
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,080
If I do so, the stone will break

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,110
and it will be unfair
to the people in the store.

123
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,400
You seem to behave yourself
in such circumstances.

124
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,910
So what should we do next?

125
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,090
Oh no!

126
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,930
How indifferent.

127
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,020
I didn't allow you to escape, criminal.

128
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:23,420
Today I finally met you, Clarissa.

129
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,710
Policeman, what can I do for you?

130
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,770
It's nothing.
I just have a lot to say to you.

131
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,020
Around the time when the fire
broke out in Shakuzawa Building,

132
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,000
you seemed quite panicked.

133
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,370
Moreover, someone witnessed the drone

134
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:41,440
of that intelligence dealer
around the building.

135
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,950
Besides,

136
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,970
we also discovered a group of
severely injured guys yesterday.

137
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,910
The leader of those people is a bastard

138
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,730
named Jimba who was cultivated by you.

139
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,400
I think there is some connection

140
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,020
between them.

141
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,260
As a police officer,

142
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,800
even if it's something difficult to
inquire about, I still have to ask.

143
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,260
How much involvement does
your organization have in these cases?

144
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,260
Lisa Kuraki.

145
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,600
Sorry, sorry.

146
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,150
Did I scare you?

147
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,600
Please don't mind.

148
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,280
Please.

149
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,000
Okay.

150
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,060
Be careful, Polka.

151
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,800
This guy is probably
not easy to deal with.

152
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,860
Can you hear me, Takumi Kuruya?

153
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,510
You can communicate

154
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,860
as long as the propellers

155
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,930
of your drone stopped, right?

156
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,200
This troublesome guy caught me.

157
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,550
What should I do?

158
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,950
Polka and Misaki
haven't been targeted yet.

159
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,640
Should I continue to remain silent?

160
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,140
Well…

161
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,220
I should have asked you

162
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,330
not to interfere.

163
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,550
Yes.

164
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,400
But that drone

165
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,800
is very important to my friend.

166
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,570
Friend? Did you mean Kuruya?

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,060
Yes.

168
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,150
This is not good.

169
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,600
You should still be
a high school student, right?

170
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,530
If you hang out with that kind of
bastard,

171
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,550
you will become one of them.

172
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,970
Break off ties with him now.

173
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
What's going on?

174
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,460
His body is so cold.

175
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,820
What is bastard?

176
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,770
What is filthiness?

177
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,260
I think it's society that

178
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,840
determines these things,

179
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,440
but

180
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,640
it's my freedom to choose
who to be friends with.

181
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,110
Oh, I see.

182
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,540
I am starting to become interested in you.

183
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,330
Can you tell me

184
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:48,750
about your situation?

185
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,110
Kozaburo Arase.

186
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,880
Although he is a police officer
belonging to

187
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,260
the Shinjuku police's
Community Safety Division,

188
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,440
he is a more dangerous guy
than the thugs on the street.

189
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,800
I used to be an intelligence dealer
for the gang Sons of the Styx,

190
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,080
and he killed eight members

191
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:12,440
of the gang in front of me in an instant,

192
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,170
with blood splattering everywhere.

193
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,150
Can you hear me, Polka?

194
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Ignore him.

195
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,600
That guy is very sensitive.

196
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,330
You need to hide your own strength.

197
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,770
If he targets you,

198
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,130
you won't have the peaceful life
you wished for anymore.

199
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,020
That guy is a police officer.

200
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,970
Did he say that to you?

201
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,240
He wanted to become friends with you.

202
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,000
People who casually talked about
friendship like this

203
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,220
are actually suspicious.

204
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,550
Didn't your family teach you about this?

205
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,460
I was sold by my parents,

206
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,840
so I don't understand
what you mean by that.

207
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,350
Sold?

208
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,550
Sorry, that happened in my past life.

209
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,060
I'm becoming more and
more interested in you.

210
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,860
Please tell me your name.

211
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,480
Misaki has been going in and out
of Clarissa's store

212
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,730
too frequently.

213
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,260
Polka probably hasn't been walking around
there any less either.

214
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,550
It wouldn't be good if they are caught.

215
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,540
Hey, Bro Arase,

216
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,040
we haven't had a direct conversation
in a long time, have we?

217
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,660
I'm really surprised that

218
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,840
you know my phone number.

219
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,150
It seems like your skills have improved
a lot compared to back then.

220
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,820
Those two people are just
playing games with me,

221
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,200
they are family members
of employees from Clarissa's place.

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,400
Both of them are innocent.

223
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,370
Can you spare them?

224
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,020
I conducted the interrogation just
to verify if they were innocent.

225
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:35,460
I accept punishment for
violating aviation regulations.

226
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,770
Isn't this better than

227
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
posting the video of you
interrogating innocent people online?

228
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,130
Not bad.
Are you trying to make a deal with me?

229
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,710
You're being so tough

230
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,260
just because I'm not in front of you now.

231
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,420
You don't seem like the same person
who betrayed friends before.

232
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,880
At that time, you were crying and saying,

233
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,730
"I will provide information,
so please don't hit me."

234
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,620
Hey, do you really know

235
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,020
what kind of person Takumi Kuruya is?

236
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,970
He is a guy who can
easily betray his friends

237
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,330
for self-protection.

238
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,950
He even told me things
I didn't asked about,

239
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:16,310
like how many moles
his friend's sister has.

240
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,130
How could I possibly know about that?

241
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,020
That is a criminal lacking backbone.

242
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,680
Did you know what he said behind your back?

243
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,770
As long as one spends money,

244
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,620
he will easily reveal
your secrets to others.

245
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,170
My secret?

246
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,440
But at least

247
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,910
he is better than you now.

248
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,970
This guy

249
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,730
is definitely not an ordinary kid.

250
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,530
The heavy momentum is like a cannonball.

251
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,910
It's more like the underworld boss
lurking in the Shura field?

252
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,260
An experienced soldier? Impossible.

253
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,680
I don't want him to witness my power

254
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,930
or investigate my identity.

255
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,150
What will Misaki do?

256
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,840
Huh?

257
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,510
Where did the girl who was with him go?

258
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,710
It's so scary.

259
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,040
I almost got hit by
this suspicious guy just now,

260
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,220
so this should be considered
self-defense.

261
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,510
Okay, let's escape quickly.

262
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,080
If we stay here any longer,
we will be attacked by him.

263
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,000
The power she just displayed
is not what a little kid should have.

264
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,220
Where did they run off to?

265
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,880
It was really close.

266
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,620
Honestly, you are a big help.

267
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,400
Kuruya

268
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,970
also messaged me, and told me

269
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,040
he is a police and let us escape.

270
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:04,750
Are you alright, Polka?

271
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,750
Yes.

272
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,760
Well…

273
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,170
You have concerned about me,

274
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,330
and I am very happy.

275
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,080
But what you just said
really overestimates me.

276
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,330
That guy didn't say it wrong,

277
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,020
I value my own life very much.

278
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,400
If I were threatened,

279
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,800
I probably wouldn't hesitate
to sell the information about you.

280
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,040
You are overestimating me by saying that.

281
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,220
For me, there is no secret
more important than

282
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,110
the lives of my friends.

283
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,000
May I ask,

284
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,280
were you also that decisive
in your past life?

285
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,970
I mentioned the Geldwood Church
to you before, right?

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
The group used a sacred spell

287
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,800
that can force others to reveal secrets.

288
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,040
So for me,

289
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,170
selling information
is not a big deal to me.

290
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,770
Is that church really holy?

291
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,310
At least one person should be.

292
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,256
SHINJUKU POLICE STATION

293
00:15:04,256 --> 00:15:06,000
Hey, Miss Aikawa.

294
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,910
Although it may sound a bit strange,

295
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,640
can you please investigate this footprint?

296
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,860
What is this? It's hilarious.

297
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,280
By the way, isn't this
a woman's shoe print?

298
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,730
What are you up to?

299
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,330
Arase, you need treatment.

300
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,260
SHINJUKU POLICE STATION, 25 YEARS OF SERVICE, FUMIYO YAMADA
You need to get treated quickly.

301
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,550
Don't move, and take off your clothes.

302
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,460
Wait, no…

303
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,730
That footprint…

304
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,400
It probably doesn't
need to be investigated.

305
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,470
Huh?

306
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,020
I just saw it earlier.

307
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,550
This is a footprint left at the scene
of human bodies tied up.

308
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,460
It's the most important evidence,
besides the traces of the lemmings.

309
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,530
Look at that.

310
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,150
It's so scary.

311
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,820
If you need treatment, go to the room.

312
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,310
The one on your back scared everyone.

313
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm lucky!

314
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,220
It's been a long time

315
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,750
since we had an interesting case
like this.

316
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,310
The Comps-3 is chaotic.

317
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,170
It seems like they have found
traces of the Lemmings.

318
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,020
That calamity?

319
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,570
That guy probably appeared

320
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,280
five years ago.

321
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,440
Killing, guarding, transporting goods,

322
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,970
kidnapping, robbing, destroying evidence.

323
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,040
He does any job to make money.

324
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,970
Rumor has it that he is called the
Jack-of-all-trades who stops at nothing.

325
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,130
I only met him once in person.

326
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,680
That guy is undoubtedly a monster.

327
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,510
The group of people who confronted him

328
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,280
even used submachine guns,

329
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:40,290
but he twisted their necks

330
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,660
while enduring the rain of bullets

331
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:45,970
without hiding

332
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,170
or avoiding them.

333
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,220
Although I really want to say that

334
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,510
we should catch him with our own strength,

335
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,060
it is ultimately under the jurisdiction
of the Comps-3.

336
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,730
We can only leave it to Iwanome
and his team to handle.

337
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:00,640
Although Iwanome is a strange man

338
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,150
who failed the civil service exam,

339
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,750
we can't be fooled by his
slovenly attitude.

340
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,910
In fact, he is a very principled man.

341
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,370
Then I said,

342
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,680
"Stop trying to be clever."

343
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,880
No way.

344
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,770
That's something only
the person who has been framed would say.

345
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:19,530
So what is that person here for?

346
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,640
He must have come to ask questions

347
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,530
because he couldn't get a search warrant

348
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,330
and wanted to gather information first.

349
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,800
Hey, Lisa Kuraki!

350
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,330
Speak honestly!

351
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,280
I knew you must have a connection

352
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,150
with calamities.

353
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,370
Confess now.

354
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,460
The Lemmings or Fire-breathing Bug
are not your subordinates.

355
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,910
But the Grim Reaper is
your subordinate, right?

356
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,800
Who's the Grim Reaper? Sounds scary.

357
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,880
Lame min? What a cute name.

358
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,910
The Lemmings

359
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,640
is a pretty scary person.

360
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,530
I was really scared when I saw him

361
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:58,280
break through the encirclement
of 30 members of the Mobile Squad.

362
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,750
Don't disclose this to the media.

363
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,200
Should I speak out about it?

364
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,770
Are we just going to let him be?

365
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,080
The Shinjuku Police Station
never released this intelligence.

366
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
Anyway, it's mutual.

367
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,860
This store

368
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,420
is no longer just a simple bar.

369
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,200
He also understood this
and came to provoke us.

370
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,660
Even moving bones appeared at
the scene of the fire.

371
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,820
I faintly scent a new calamity.

372
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,400
It's so scary.

373
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,660
If he catches our weak point,
it will be bad.

374
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,310
We need to warn Polka

375
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,060
to be extra careful.

376
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,510
Clarissa, we came to play.

377
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,460
Bad timing.

378
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,280
Hey hey, miss over there,

379
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,660
are you still underage?

380
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,970
You can't come to this kind of place.

381
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,540
Don't worry about it.
I plan on ordering milk to drink.

382
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,840
Kids have been so mature these days.

383
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,240
Hey, you two.

384
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,620
I'm treating you to some juice.

385
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,600
Can you tell me what's popular
among young people

386
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,080
these days?

387
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,740
SHINJUKU POLICE STATION
It's Arase.

388
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,200
Where are they going?

389
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,910
This direction is…

390
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,710
Could it be… It's so hot!

391
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,570
Water spilled out.

392
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,310
So dangerous.

393
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,710
And then, Hagane said to him,

394
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,860
"You're always trying to be clever"!

395
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,820
That's something only
someone who has been framed would say.

396
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,840
Who is Hagane?

397
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,040
What's wrong

398
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,730
with this juice?

399
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,770
Before becoming this supernatural being,

400
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,880
I've never had such delicious drink.

401
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,080
I really want the people

402
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,570
in the wasteland to taste it too.

403
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,770
Why did he cry?

404
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,080
I don't know.

405
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,680
Hey Polka! Are you in the bar?

406
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,150
Don't reply me.

407
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,420
If you are there,
leave immediately from the back door.

408
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,460
Can you please move aside?

409
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,150
I am a customer, at least for now.

410
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,800
Okay, let him come in.

411
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,350
Besides, his friend is also here.

412
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:18,640
Hey! Arase, over here!

413
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:20,266
The woman is as cunning as a fox.

414
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:24,288
I didn't expect you to really be with her.

415
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,288
You're the bad guy who just hit me

416
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,200
and tried to push me down.

417
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,044
I didn't try to push you down.

418
00:20:33,177 --> 00:20:34,266
You're really terrible.

419
00:20:34,577 --> 00:20:36,022
Leader?

420
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,844
Just kidding.

421
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:41,133
Can I ask you two

422
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,000
about something?

423
00:20:43,866 --> 00:20:45,711
You don't want to be charged

424
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:48,155
with obstructing official duties, do you?

425
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:53,466
Stop trying to be clever.

426
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:54,822
It wasn't us.

427
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,266
Polka, what should we do?

428
00:20:57,466 --> 00:20:58,600
Should we just run away?

429
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,666
That seems like the best option.

430
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,177
I'll lead the way this time.

431
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:13,044
That's a bold proposal.

432
00:21:23,311 --> 00:21:24,320
Polka?

433
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:28,444
What's going on? Who is here?

434
00:21:29,444 --> 00:21:30,644
Let me provide the light.

435
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:56,911
Hey, is this for real?

436
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,030
Why are you here?

437
00:22:01,977 --> 00:22:03,111
Lemmings.

438
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,288
