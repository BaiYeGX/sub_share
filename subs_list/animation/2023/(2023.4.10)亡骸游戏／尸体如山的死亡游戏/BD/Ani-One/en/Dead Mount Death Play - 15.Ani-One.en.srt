1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,960
Did they leave?

2
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,020
The reporter's gone home too.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,320
Yeah. Today wasn't a good day
for an interview.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,180
Leaving all this aside.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,000
Wh-Why?

6
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,880
For decades, that building has been
at the center of all kinds of rumors.

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,520
There was also the bloodstain of a missing
police officer from five years ago.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,480
And now, they're launching a major investigation into
a mugger who sought refuge in it? That's not normal.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,260
This is no job for a rookie to take on.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,660
Hand it over to Himura Atari.
He's a veteran.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,760
No.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,720
This is my story.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,740
If I force her out, she probably goes out
and covers the story in her own time.

14
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,800
Let me do it, Chief!

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,680
I have exposed a misdeed, Chief!

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,460
Here's photographic evidence, Chief!

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,260
But she's too good for me
to just fire her over it.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,640
Fine. Then I'll compromise.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,360
Stick to the occult angle
as an occult reporter

20
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,020
and tell the story of diviner Corpse God.

21
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,840
Don't take it any further than that.

22
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,320
Don't investigate anything
beyond his fortune-telling.

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,520
Aw…

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,400
And pulling that face isn't
going to do anything.

25
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,700
In exchange, if anything else comes up,

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,100
I'll give you first dibs
on exclusive news.

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,700
Okay, but…

28
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,560
But what?

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,160
You don't trust your hunch that Polka
Shinoyama is at the center of all this?

30
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,160
Heh…

31
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,420
Don't think so little of me, Chief Editor!

32
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:43,440
I'll definitely prove that Polka Shinoyama
is the key player in this case.

33
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,760
Oh yes.

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,160
Wait. Don't forge
any evidence or anything, okay?

(Dead Mount, Death Play)

36
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,620
(Episode 15: The Vampire)
By the way, young lady.

37
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,360
I got those things you asked me for.

38
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,160
Thanks.

39
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,520
So

40
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,960
what's in there, really?

41
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,060
Something to cover my room rent.

42
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,440
Magic storing stones!

43
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,720
STONES THAT HAVE MAGIC STORED IN THEM, KNOWN AS JEWELS IN THIS WORLD
Raw gems?

44
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:42,480
I had Xiaoyu go around to the accessory
shops and general stores to buy them.

45
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,340
Are you sure I can have them?

46
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,740
It's fine.

47
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,960
After all, the real Polka
was saved thanks to you.

48
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,720
So she knows this Polka's a fake.

49
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,240
And he saved the real Polka?

50
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,480
What does that mean?

51
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,640
Also, what is he going to do
with all those raw gems?

52
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,060
So? So what can you do with all these?

53
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,040
Well…

54
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,900
There's one major thing
I can think of doing.

55
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,240
I know what the first thing
I'm going to do is.

56
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,280
That is…

57
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,260
What's that mean?

58
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,020
So what do we do about our problem now?

59
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,620
I contacted Clarissa,

60
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,220
but what about the corpse
in the basement passage?

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
A corpse? What's this about?

62
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,220
For the time being, let's just
make sure it's not discovered.

63
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,040
I guess it's a bartender named Nishida
who worked for Clarissa.

64
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,420
Urai returned to Clarissa's bar
during the investigation.

65
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,480
Oh, so he works at Clarissa's place.

66
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,820
Immediately after Nishida's body
was dumped here, the police showed up.

67
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,540
In other words, are the police
in cahoots with whoever killed Nishida?

68
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,620
Darn it.

69
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,700
We'll talk more later!

70
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,840
I'm going to slip out the back,
so take care of the rest for me!

71
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,980
If you need anything, contact me.

72
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,920
See you.

73
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,560
Oh, okay.

74
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,020
Wow, this all looks delicious!

75
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,520
I've always thought so,
you're a really good chef.

76
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,300
Just doing my job.

77
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,760
Thanks for the food.

78
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,280
Hey.

79
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,600
Hello.

80
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,340
You're eating?

81
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,380
Sorry for interrupting.

82
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,220
Are you guys looking for the mugger too?

83
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,000
No. We're still on the Solitaire case.

84
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,320
Then, let me get straight to the point.

85
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,400
Why did Solitaire come to this building?

86
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,060
You know the answer to that, don't you?

87
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,340
The reason why Solitaire came here…

88
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:44,580
This policeman shouldn't know
anything about that mark.

89
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,860
No, I have no idea why.

90
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,340
Ah!

91
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,920
P-Polka!

92
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,740
What I wrote down for
this detective before…

93
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,340
There's only one thing
connecting you and Solitaire.

94
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,200
The mark Solitaire drew on his airship.

95
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,480
You can get in touch with Mr. Hosorogi,

96
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,000
can't you?

97
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,000
Can you let me see him?

98
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,140
So in other words,

99
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,780
you didn't believe my fortune-telling
skills from the beginning.

100
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
If you don't believe in me,

101
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,060
and I can't form a relationship
of mutual trust with you,

102
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,540
then there's nothing I can say.

103
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,360
Hey.

104
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,420
We've come too far,
and you still want to weasel out of this?

105
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,300
What can be known is that

106
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,060
PANIC! THE MYSTERIOUS ORGANIZATION HIDDEN IN SOCIETY!
the danger is drawing near.

107
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,780
How far can my hands reach?

108
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,080
There might be souls that I miss.

109
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,560
That's why I must be cautious.

110
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,700
How about you come clean with me, boy?

111
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,960
FOOD
Food…

112
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:55,660
Prove to me you're not involved
with the underbelly of the police force.

113
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,060
Your answer is on the piece
of paper that guided you earlier.

114
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,640
"If you still believe in me,

115
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,160
then keep pursuing it."

116
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,400
That's from the person you want to see.

117
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,240
Geez.

118
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,500
There have been too many things today,
one after another.

119
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,940
But for now, I have to sort that out.

120
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,420
Hmm?

121
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,780
I don't remember ordering any packages.

122
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,580
Don't tell me it's Arase.

123
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,800
Mr. Higuro?

124
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,240
Why would he be here now?

125
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,540
"Why," indeed.

126
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,400
Aren't you going to let him in?

127
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,200
Mr. Higuro is a lonely guy,

128
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,240
so he might cry, you know?

129
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:48,440
But, you might be the one
who ends up in tears.

130
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,300
Hang on. I'll be right up.

131
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:57,240
So Polka Shinoyama really is
in contact with inspector Hosorogi?

132
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,580
I don't know.

133
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,680
But either way, he's right.

134
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,120
First, I'll investigate
the fortune-telling paper.

135
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,200
Aren't we acting immediately?

136
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,860
I'd love to.

137
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,880
But if we're not careful,
they could catch wind of our activities.

138
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,580
This situation is really unbearable.

139
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,760
We can't even trust our own organization.

140
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,380
You said it.

141
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,900
I fully understand why
Mr. Hosorogi disappeared.

142
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:23,300
THE KEY IS BEHIND THE 1-383 MIRROR.

143
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,340
Darn it.

144
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,580
It's starting to rain again.

145
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,420
Long time no see.

146
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,840
What're you doing here after all this?

147
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,500
Haha. You hate me so much.

148
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,840
Isn't that obvious?

149
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,760
You must at least know
that I'm working for Clarissa now.

150
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,300
Sure.

151
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,040
That's why I'm here.

152
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:49,340
You figure it out?

153
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,180
Did you turn Nishida into a mugger?

154
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,900
You thought it for a moment, didn't you?

155
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,040
You were choosing your words.

156
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,680
Right?

157
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,180
Whether to say "dead body" or "mugger."

158
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,720
So it really was you.

159
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,980
I figured you knew about the dead body.

160
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,480
Pain is good.
It dulls a person's judgement.

161
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,240
It makes you fall for questions
you would normally never fall for.

162
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,880
All the more for someone
who fears pain, like you.

163
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,360
How did you manage to hide the body?

164
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
My employer is willing
to use any means necessary

165
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,140
to deal with all the people associated with
the building you're using.

166
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,360
So we need the body of the mugger
to be found in that building.

167
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,080
Are you sure you should be
saying all this in front of me?

168
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,560
Of course.

169
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,640
You're smart,
so you understand why, don't you?

170
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,840
Now that you've heard it,
you're all out of options.

171
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,480
Mr. Higuro.

172
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,860
He might still have options.

173
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,800
Misaki?

174
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,780
Huh, where's Misaki?

175
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,080
She went to get Takumi.

176
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,420
Miss Clarissa called to speak with him.

177
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,200
So the Shinjuku intermediary agency

178
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,640
figured out what I was up to.

179
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Did you receive some kind of training?

180
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,060
It doesn't make sense that
you're stronger than me with that body.

181
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,160
I'm a growing girl!

182
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,920
So close.

183
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,880
Nobody's ever jumped over me before.

184
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,420
No joke.

185
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,660
That was really close.

186
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,700
Misaki.

187
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,540
Hey, Misa--

188
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,440
Oh dear.

189
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,200
Now Shibuya and Shinjuku are very likely
to have a conflict.

190
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,760
Great.

191
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,820
If I get to fight with more kids
like this, I'll gladly welcome it.

192
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,860
I'd rather not.

193
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,040
Hey.

194
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,640
I'm really sorry.

195
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,000
There was a slight hiccup.

196
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,180
I'll report to you later.

197
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,480
Under the protection of Sabaramond,
there can be no failure.

198
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,180
Are you sure it was okay to
use the gems for that?

199
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,860
Yes. What I can do is limited.

200
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,220
I know what the first thing
I'm going to do is.

201
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,000
Having Misaki evolve into new species.

202
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,600
Not only will it widen
my hands of protection,

203
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,140
but I want to increase the number of
allies who can help me protect everyone.

204
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,260
Now Misaki is no longer a zombie.

205
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,780
She's a vampire.

206
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,200
I see.

207
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,580
It's so weird
that I was killed but didn't die!

208
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,720
But thanks to that,
I think I'm getting used to it.

209
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,260
Is this what rebirth feels like?

210
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,660
No.

211
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,500
Nothing's changed.

212
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,180
I've always been a monster.

213
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,060
TEN YEARS AGO
You don't smile much, do you?

214
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,980
I bet you'd be a real charmer
if you did, though.

215
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,560
I want to smile.

216
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,860
But I forgot how to.

217
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,120
What makes someone smile
differs from person to person.

218
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,320
What if you try copying
what other people seem to enjoy?

219
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,760
Is there such a thing?

220
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,380
What other people seem to enjoy…

221
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,300
I know.

222
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,620
What is it?
I'll do what I can to help you.

223
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,760
Killing people.

224
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,480
Something landed on us.

225
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,020
Is it a pursuer?

226
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,540
Oh.

227
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,060
They ran away.

228
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,560
I'll catch up!

229
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,740
Huh?

230
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,520
I guess it's hard to get airborne
starting from the ground!

231
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,900
There they are!

232
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,120
That was close!

233
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,540
But Polka is really amazing!

234
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,600
Even though it's new to me,

235
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,440
I can get around in the body
like it's always been mine!

236
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,660
Being a vampire is great!

237
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,420
I like this!

238
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,900
By the way, Clarissa,

239
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,040
I'm enjoying this right now!

240
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,060
Besides killing people,
I've found something else I enjoy!

241
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,360
I never knew that helping someone
could get my heart racing like this!

242
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,560
Or that challenging someone way stronger
than me could be this thrilling!

243
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,620
I know you're awake, Takumi.

244
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,320
If you are really asleep,

245
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,720
then how about we peel the skin off
your arm to wake you up?

246
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,060
All right!

247
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,420
I'm awake, so just don't torture me!

248
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,180
Oh, that's good.

249
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,620
Now you won't have to
embarrass yourself in front of Agakura.

250
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,740
That bean-pole there is an Agakura?

251
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,440
"Bean-pole"? So funny.

252
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,440
Granted, I am the tallest in the family.

253
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,880
How well-known our family is.

254
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,400
Of course.

255
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,780
The Agakura is infamous in the underworld
as an elite circle of crazies.

256
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,140
"Don't mess with the 'Crazy Bones Kagura'
or the Agakura family."

257
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,380
You're the one
who told me that, Mr. Higuro.

258
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,460
Yeah. That's right.

259
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,180
So I paid Agakura's guys
to be on our side.

260
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,400
Just like you've allied with the Heilei.

261
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Heilei?

262
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,180
You don't look like you're playing dumb.

263
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:39,340
So Shinoyama doesn't completely
trust you either.

264
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,160
What are you talking about?

265
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,580
Isn't there a black-haired boy
in your building?

266
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,500
He's an assassin employed
by the Shinoyama family.

267
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,960
Just when I was planting a listening
device in that Takumi guy's place

268
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,000
to see if I could get
more info on the corpse.

269
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
Why? Why are they…

270
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,620
Agakura!

271
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,140
I have no reason
to interfere with Agakura.

272
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,020
No.

273
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm not a Heilei anymore.

274
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,420
If I can get him out of here,

275
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,200
having that fake Polka owe me one
isn't such a bad plan.

276
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,900
Why don't we pick up where we left off?

277
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,860
You don't have a choice.

278
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,520
We made it that far, right?

279
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,600
Hey.

280
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,860
Doesn't he actually have two choices?

281
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,340
Either he cooperates or he dies.

282
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,320
Oh, he doesn't have that.

283
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,020
Yeah, Takumi?

284
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,260
When death's staring you in the face,
you easily abandon the "now."

285
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,180
That head-mounted display
you've got on proves that.

286
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,300
When you were young and believed
in the goodness of people.

287
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,220
FATHER: IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT
Yet you were betrayed by the world and your parents.

288
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,020
After that,

289
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,880
you believed that evil
was the correct path.

290
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,320
So you joined the gang Sons of the Styx.

291
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,160
And then Arase crushed that gang, thereby
destroying the value you'd placed in that.

292
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,440
Neither justice nor evil feel real to you.

293
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,420
You…

294
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,640
PLAY START
developed a phobia of reality.

295
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,480
The view of the world through your camera

296
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,880
gives you peace of mind
because it makes everything like a game.

297
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,260
It's a really sad story.

298
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,380
Almost makes me want to cry.

299
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,760
You sure know your stuff.

300
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,180
Well, I did appreciate
your intel-gathering abilities.

301
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,320
I'd thought if I had the chance,
I might win you back over.

302
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,640
But it seems that Miss Kuraki
values you very much.

303
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,520
Why would you live
in that abandoned building?

304
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,580
I'd be so happy if you'd tell me that.

305
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,680
You don't want it to
be game over yet, do you?

306
00:17:41,664 --> 00:17:43,515
CLOSE

307
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,980
CALL RECORDS
I still can't get through to Kuruya's cell.

308
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,160
I've always wondered

309
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,760
whether we can really trust that guy.

310
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,520
As long as he's bound by fear,
he's obedient.

311
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,140
But when he's faced with
an even greater fear, all bets are off.

312
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,340
So it'll be bad if he's been
captured by the enemy, right?

313
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,820
We should've planted
a self-destruct device on him.

314
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,360
You're right.
This is actually perfect timing.

315
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,800
He needed other shackles besides fear.

316
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,600
A new bond besides the one he has with us.

317
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,820
Haha, you got me.

318
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,760
You're right that I'm afraid
of being game over.

319
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,280
But giving in to you here and now
would be a bad ending too.

320
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,880
Don't worry. I only grazed you.

321
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:37,020
In movies, getting shot in the arm or leg
is treated like a minor injury.

322
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,180
In reality, if the bullet hit a major
artery, you'd die of blood loss, you know?

323
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,720
And

324
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,700
you'll end up talking in the end anyway.

325
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,000
No secrets would be
more important than your life.

326
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,100
My friends' lives are much more valuable
than any secret of mine.

327
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,740
Yes.

328
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,480
You're right.

329
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,540
Mr. Higuro.

330
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,340
You feel like answering me now?

331
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,020
Nobody likes the guy who goes through

332
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,960
the whole movie but insisting,
"That's not how it works in real life."

333
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
I agree with that.

334
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,080
You think that's just a threat?

335
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,360
Something is off.

336
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,300
I can tell he's afraid of pain.

337
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,420
But he's not afraid of death itself?

338
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,940
If I die,

339
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,520
bring me back to life, Polka.

340
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,920
I had steamed meat dumplings for lunch,

341
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,180
but I only dipped them in mustard
when eating.

342
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:43,744
SOY SAUCE

343
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:48,540
Feel like talking now?

344
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,220
Maybe a little.

345
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,900
I want to be stubborn too.

346
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,720
Otherwise, I…

347
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,820
wouldn't be able to take a step forward.

348
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,480
I wish you'd held onto that stubbornness
back when Arase was threatening you.

349
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,700
I'll just say one thing.

350
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,240
This doesn't have to be you.

351
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,640
For example, it could be that girl
who is always holding the stuffed shark.

352
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,260
Hey.

353
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,440
Don't you know who she is?

354
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,660
The Shinoyama family won't let you go.

355
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,460
That's fine.

356
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,520
Higher up will solve this for me.

357
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,000
Higher up?

358
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,680
So you can stop worrying
and keep writhing around.

359
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,240
Even if you die,

360
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,980
you can always be replaced.

361
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,400
I found a reason to save him.

362
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,080
If his death would put
my young lady next in line,

363
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,020
then I'd better keep him
alive to take the heat.

364
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
Well, well.

365
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,340
You also gave me a reason
to kill you guys.

366
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,940
If you'd do wrong to the Shinoyama,

367
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,760
then you're my enemy.

368
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,140
The Shinjuku mugging?

369
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,680
Yes.

370
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,760
We went to investigate that building
where Solitaire showed up.

371
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,940
Wait a minute.

372
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,300
I was never told…

373
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,240
No, wait.

374
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,920
The building where Solitaire showed up?

375
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,760
The one where Hosorogi…

376
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,320
You can look into it,
but let me remind you,

377
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,480
don't let your emotions
get the better of you.

378
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,620
If you go on a rampage,

379
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,540
even I won't be able to cover for you.

380
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,020
I'll be fine.

381
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,380
I have a lackey who'll keep me in the line
even if he has to punch me to do it.

382
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,700
Come in.

383
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,020
This is a nice chair.

384
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,860
You could say such a fine piece
fits your responsibility.

385
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,460
If you want to be famous,
you're in the wrong place.

386
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,340
Phantom Solitaire.

387
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,200
