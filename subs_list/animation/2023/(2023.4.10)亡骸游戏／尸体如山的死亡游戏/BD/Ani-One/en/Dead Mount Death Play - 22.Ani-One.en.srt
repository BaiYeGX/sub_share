1
00:00:04,794 --> 00:00:06,614
You don't have to worry, Lulu.

2
00:00:06,894 --> 00:00:08,714
I doubt any of them are dead.

3
00:00:08,854 --> 00:00:11,914
After all, you did your very best
to persuade the elf.

4
00:00:13,034 --> 00:00:14,014
But…

5
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:16,554
No civilians were involved.

6
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:19,134
And the surveillance cameras
were also destroyed.

7
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:22,134
The elders are thorough
about these things.

8
00:00:22,194 --> 00:00:25,334
I knew our organization was not unified,

9
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,574
but what were they thinking,
sending out those goons to

10
00:00:27,574 --> 00:00:29,674
openly get in our way like that?

11
00:00:31,234 --> 00:00:33,154
They are afraid of the bug.

12
00:00:34,074 --> 00:00:38,214
They had a hard time leaving the country and
set up headquarters in this remote city in the east.

13
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:42,914
They fear me leaking information
because they did not want to get burned.

14
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:47,294
After all, it's impossible to remain uninvolved,
so I'll take the flames myself before they take any heat.

15
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:48,174
Huh?

16
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:52,914
There's a Japanese phrase,
"A moth flying into the flames."

17
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:56,434
As far as the bug is concerned,
I believe I'd be the best bait.

18
00:00:57,574 --> 00:01:01,314
Use me as bait to
gather those guys in this city.

19
00:01:01,914 --> 00:01:04,934
Don't you think that crushing them
all in one fell swoop is an effective way?

(Episode 22: The Karma)

22
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,906
There's something I'd like to ask.

23
00:02:42,006 --> 00:02:43,066
What is it?

24
00:02:43,266 --> 00:02:46,626
Why were you in the building
where the diviner was located?

25
00:02:47,346 --> 00:02:50,846
Was that giant swarm of arms your trick?

26
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,606
Why do you want to know about that?

27
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:58,066
Because you may already have
attained what you desire.

28
00:02:58,686 --> 00:03:02,466
Something my employers have been
seeking for a hundred years.

29
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:04,626
Interesting.

30
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,886
You've already entered the vortex.

31
00:03:07,226 --> 00:03:09,726
No, you're already at the heart of it.

32
00:03:10,466 --> 00:03:12,266
Maybe next time it won't be the puppet.

33
00:03:12,686 --> 00:03:15,906
It'll be your own face
that gets blown off.

34
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:21,846
Don't! Don't do this to me!

35
00:03:22,426 --> 00:03:23,426
Pipe down.

36
00:03:23,426 --> 00:03:26,826
Sorry, sorry, this is just too funny!

37
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:32,466
I feel bad for you, so I think I'll
forgive you for abandoning me.

38
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,746
But I really envy you, Mr. Higuro.

39
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:36,726
SOLITAIRE
You've made friends with Solitaire, haven't you?

40
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:37,606
SOLITAIRE
You've made friends with Solitaire, haven't you?

41
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:39,526
Can you get his autograph for me?

42
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:45,086
And Majiri, I hope she's
playing nice with those kids.

43
00:03:46,406 --> 00:03:48,526
So that's the building.

44
00:03:49,446 --> 00:03:52,266
I wonder if the kid assassin is in.

45
00:03:53,606 --> 00:03:55,306
Do you happen to know?

46
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,086
You're with the Heilei, right?

47
00:04:01,826 --> 00:04:03,266
Excellent timing.

48
00:04:03,446 --> 00:04:05,506
I was just hoping to say hello.

49
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:07,186
That boy,

50
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:10,166
Xiaoyu, is going to
become my little brother.

51
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:13,586
So that makes us soon-to-be relatives.

52
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,496
FOUND THEM FOUND THEM AGAKURA AGAKURA

53
00:04:17,186 --> 00:04:19,166
So don't be rude.

54
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,386
Calling your friends is useless.

55
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:26,946
I WILL KILL THE DEMON THAT TRIES TO TAKE YOU AWAY FROM ME
I'm warning you.

56
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:30,026
I see, you're…

57
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:32,320
HEILEI CADRE, BAO, REAL NAME: LEI YENMEI
The only big sister

58
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,986
HEILEI CADRE, BAO, REAL NAME: LEI YENMEI
of Xiaoyu is me.

59
00:04:36,086 --> 00:04:41,066
Heilei doesn't need a dirtbag who was
knocked down by a little girl from Agakura.

60
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:44,026
I'd happily dispose of him my--

61
00:04:48,046 --> 00:04:50,726
My daughter is fierce.

62
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:55,966
When I mentioned making
Xiaoyu into a t'ing-fu,

63
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:59,646
she even tried to kill me, her father.

64
00:05:00,246 --> 00:05:01,346
Don't

65
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,926
insult my younger brother, Xiaoyu.

66
00:05:06,566 --> 00:05:11,186
So this is revenge for
that cute kid assassin?

67
00:05:11,606 --> 00:05:12,806
Not quite.

68
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,286
Am I mistaken?

69
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:17,106
You're right about calling Xiaoyu "Cute."

70
00:05:17,246 --> 00:05:19,486
Yes! That, we can agree on.

71
00:05:21,226 --> 00:05:23,546
I hate you for maiming my little brother.

72
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:25,706
But I also thank you for it.

73
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:28,806
Thank me?

74
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:30,886
After he lost his limbs,

75
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,606
he was able to get away
from that accursed family.

76
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,706
That's unexpected.

77
00:05:39,866 --> 00:05:44,366
I thought the Heilei were
much more loyal to their family.

78
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,446
I'm not interested in
antiquated value systems.

79
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:49,726
But

80
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:52,566
if you try to take
my brother away from me,

81
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:54,266
then die.

82
00:05:55,786 --> 00:05:58,646
Are these really a source
of magical power?

83
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:02,306
Yes, they should replenish
the strength of your arms too.

84
00:06:02,586 --> 00:06:04,246
So jewels are my fuel…

85
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:07,926
So that's why Lady Sayo was
accumulating so many jewels.

86
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:11,886
If raw ore will work, you could buy
more of it cheaper, you know?

87
00:06:12,126 --> 00:06:17,086
The more transparent and larger it is,
the more magic is in it.

88
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:19,886
So now the only issue
is the matter of money.

89
00:06:20,746 --> 00:06:23,146
In order to get back the real Polka,

90
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:25,606
I hope to accumulate it
as much as possible.

91
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,366
However, I can't always rely on Mr. Rozan.

92
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:32,626
It's my fault.

93
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:36,586
I was the only one of the guards

94
00:06:37,026 --> 00:06:38,986
who knew that stuffed animal
was the real Polka.

95
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:40,646
This is not your fault.

96
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:44,626
In any case, we have to
report this to Mr. Rozan.

97
00:06:45,186 --> 00:06:46,626
Report to Master…

98
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:48,826
-It's impossible.
-Huh?

99
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:52,046
Grandpa should have been
hospitalized today.

100
00:06:52,226 --> 00:06:53,666
Oh! Right, today's…

101
00:06:53,966 --> 00:06:55,766
It's just a routine checkup,

102
00:06:55,926 --> 00:06:59,346
but he'll be under general anesthesia
and in no condition for a conversation.

103
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:02,846
Even though it was only for a moment,
I was almost relieved.

104
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,866
I thought it would give me the chance
to get Polka back safely

105
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:09,946
before Master found out about my blunder.

106
00:07:11,366 --> 00:07:12,786
I'm so screwed up.

107
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:17,646
Do you resent having
to protect the real Polka?

108
00:07:18,946 --> 00:07:21,446
-That's none of your--
-Can you really say it's none

109
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:23,006
of my business given the situation?

110
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:25,566
Take it slow.

111
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:27,466
Let's have a little talk.

112
00:07:30,306 --> 00:07:33,386
I disliked him from the beginning.

113
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:39,246
But in all honesty, it's only recently
that I've realized I hate him deep down.

114
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:42,586
That guy doesn't understand
the feelings of Master…

115
00:07:43,786 --> 00:07:47,506
I carry these arms and legs I received
from Lord Rozan with pride.

116
00:07:48,246 --> 00:07:51,546
And yet he, born Lord Rozan's true son,

117
00:07:51,866 --> 00:07:57,146
has no pride in
or attachment to his own body.

118
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:01,446
I will never have any
biological connection with Lord Rozan.

119
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,666
I can never be his real son.

120
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,926
But that guy…

121
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:09,646
takes what he has for granted.

122
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,066
No, this is my excuse.

123
00:08:12,346 --> 00:08:15,446
I'm just jealous of him,
pure and simple. Forget it.

124
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:22,426
I'm so pathetic.

125
00:08:24,906 --> 00:08:26,326
My father

126
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,806
sold me for money.

127
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:33,906
And in the end,
he stabbed me for his own greed.

128
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:40,006
So, I also envy the bonds within
families that share the same blood.

129
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:45,606
I know that you feel just
as bonded as if Mr. Rozan were family.

130
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:52,806
And I firmly believe
that feeling goes both ways.

131
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:57,246
I'm sure that, blood aside,
your souls are bound.

132
00:08:59,106 --> 00:09:00,826
So, this connection

133
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:03,806
should be treasured as well.

134
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:08,446
Because the pain, if it were severed,
would hurt just as deeply.

135
00:09:11,646 --> 00:09:13,426
So, this time,

136
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:17,286
I must work to build a world where
everyone can live peacefully together.

137
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,426
Hello, Nezu? What's up?

138
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,126
You already done with your job there?

139
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:31,866
So you'll be back here in three days.

140
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:33,326
DINNER, STRATEGY MEETING
Just in time.

141
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,626
COMPANY PLAN APPROVAL, MANAGEMENT MEETING
I have something for you to help me with.

142
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,678
TWO DAYS AGO

143
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,378
That's about it.

144
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:43,278
I'm sorry for asking you to do this.

145
00:09:43,858 --> 00:09:45,738
It's fine. Don't sweat it.

146
00:09:45,998 --> 00:09:49,698
It's my job to help you
with your peaceful life, after all.

147
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:52,638
Polka was kidnapped yesterday.

148
00:09:52,738 --> 00:09:55,498
As a result, you got involved in
something far from peaceful life.

149
00:09:55,718 --> 00:09:57,878
This is for the peace
that lies beyond, right?

150
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,418
Still.

151
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:04,458
STRANGE PHENOMENON SIGHTED IN THE CITY
That old man's just going from one stunt to the next.

152
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,538
A WRITTEN CHALLENGE FROM SOLITAIRE
What is he thinking?

153
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:12,818
Huh?

154
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:15,238
What is that?

155
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:17,920
SOLITAIRE IS HERE

156
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,478
What do you think he's after?

157
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:23,478
Even asking the guy wouldn't
get you any answers.

158
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:25,958
STRANGE PHENOMENON SIGHTED IN THE CITY
But the leader

159
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:29,098
A WRITTEN CHALLENGE FROM SOLITAIRE
is a member involved with the Solitaire special investigation HQ.

160
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:31,898
If it concerns Solitaire,
we need to prioritize the investigation,

161
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:34,658
even if only as a formality.

162
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,958
-Rrrgh.
-No.

163
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,958
This isn't the work of Solitaire.

164
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:42,018
A copycat?

165
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:44,038
However, this is just my speculation.

166
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,598
Simply making something
float and then dropping it

167
00:10:46,738 --> 00:10:48,598
is a pretty old trick.

168
00:10:49,058 --> 00:10:53,018
Every aspect of Solitaire's antics
carries some significance.

169
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:57,418
So who exactly did this?

170
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:01,078
Maybe Deus Ex Kinema from Ikebukuro?

171
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:02,318
Or…

172
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:04,178
No.

173
00:11:05,038 --> 00:11:08,458
Either way, we've got
no shortage of things to look into.

174
00:11:09,198 --> 00:11:10,158
Geez.

175
00:11:10,558 --> 00:11:15,498
What connects all this stuff
that's been going on in Shinjuku?

176
00:11:16,418 --> 00:11:17,758
Oh my.

177
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:20,418
I can't believe
an impersonator has emerged.

178
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:22,758
But I'm not surprised they're doing this.

179
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:26,918
My spirit of adventure drives me
to chase this organization.

180
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,018
To you, this is nothing more
than material for your documentary.

181
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,258
Emperor of Ikebukuro's calamity…

182
00:11:32,378 --> 00:11:34,858
Mr. Deus Ex Kinema.

183
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:37,138
U-Um…

184
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:40,898
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
You have the wrong person.

185
00:11:40,998 --> 00:11:42,238
Who are you?

186
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:44,818
Hello, I am your fan.

187
00:11:45,018 --> 00:11:49,998
Should I utter a sigh of relief
that this wasn't a trap set by the police?

188
00:11:50,178 --> 00:11:52,598
That depends on your attitude.

189
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:55,998
Are you saying you're scarier
than the police?

190
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:59,578
Sorry, but in our country, it is not
customary to carry business cards.

191
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:04,058
Will you take this as
our substitute form of identification?

192
00:12:04,838 --> 00:12:06,678
The national emblem of the Byandy Empire.

193
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:11,058
This is the official name of the pattern
you've made known to the world.

194
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:12,658
I see.

195
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:16,298
No good. This will take too long.

196
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:19,678
But when I think of
what could happen, this might be…

197
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:24,098
Is it true that you summoned
your friend's soul?

198
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:27,818
I wouldn't say I summoned him
so much as he showed up on his own.

199
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:30,598
So you did have friends
where you came from.

200
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:35,158
You and Takumi are also
friends I hold dear, Misaki.

201
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:38,158
Yeah, you said that before too.

202
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:40,478
But we didn't meet
that long ago, you know?

203
00:12:40,798 --> 00:12:42,298
My master once said,

204
00:12:42,798 --> 00:12:46,098
for us necromancers who live
such long lives, bonding with people

205
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:49,478
has nothing to do with the amount
of time you've spent with them.

206
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:53,338
Is that how you got chummy
with your friend over there so quickly?

207
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:57,918
Yeah, there are often troubles
happening over there too.

208
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:01,998
You could say he and I were
best friends and accomplices.

209
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:03,278
Accomplices?

210
00:13:03,498 --> 00:13:06,018
Sorry, I didn't word that right.

211
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:08,838
We just got into mischief together a lot.

212
00:13:09,058 --> 00:13:10,258
Yeah?

213
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:13,418
I believe the three people who kidnapped

214
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:19,018
the real Polka have a strong connection
to the world over there.

215
00:13:19,838 --> 00:13:22,138
And we've been dragged
into the middle of it.

216
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:24,958
Or perhaps I'm the one
who dragged you into it.

217
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:29,798
I'm the one who dragged
both of you Polka into this to begin with.

218
00:13:30,098 --> 00:13:33,318
It was me who slit Polka's throat.

219
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:36,738
Then I tried to kill the reborn Polka.

220
00:13:36,818 --> 00:13:39,058
I'm the one who pulled you
into this world.

221
00:13:39,138 --> 00:13:40,698
That's not true…

222
00:13:40,878 --> 00:13:45,558
Good and bad people will both get involved
in your life eventually, you know?

223
00:13:46,318 --> 00:13:47,718
So,

224
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:52,118
you can involve all of us in
what you think is the right thing.

225
00:13:53,878 --> 00:13:57,178
And I am willing to be involved as well.

226
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:00,938
Let's go save the real Polka together.

227
00:14:02,278 --> 00:14:03,358
Thank you.

228
00:14:04,858 --> 00:14:06,178
I see.

229
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:11,278
So you guys want to spread the word
that you are related to Sabaramond.

230
00:14:11,398 --> 00:14:13,058
You could say that.

231
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:14,698
It doesn't matter how.

232
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:16,918
I can even be a guest in your video.

233
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:19,198
-Yay!
-The three of us can also dance together.

234
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,198
What?

235
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,698
A performance by a trio
of what I suspect to be aliens.

236
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,078
Interesting.

237
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,438
Aliens?

238
00:14:26,858 --> 00:14:28,238
Let's not talk about that right now.

239
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:31,678
You're always on the hunt
for paranormal phenomena.

240
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:34,458
Aren't you happy
with the current situation?

241
00:14:34,898 --> 00:14:38,778
No, I'm bursting with excitement inside.

242
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,838
But I can't make a judgement.

243
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:41,958
Judgment?

244
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:44,038
Something like this…

245
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:49,418
it can be reproduced with
the right materials and sleight of hand.

246
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:50,638
Oh…

247
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:51,998
Wait, for real?

248
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:54,058
Does he also have a lord elf?

249
00:14:55,738 --> 00:14:56,738
Is this the place?

250
00:14:57,078 --> 00:14:59,958
The scene of the fire 100 years ago.

251
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:04,358
So, might there be some clues
about Fire-breathing Bug here?

252
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:07,538
The outer facade's been fixed up,

253
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,038
but something's off.

254
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:12,898
The owner here is
a capitalist family from Shinjuku.

255
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:16,798
They bought this place for
a considerable price after the fire.

256
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,478
Ever since then, their grandchildren
have been living elsewhere,

257
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:22,778
and yet they haven't shown
any signs of wanting to sell here.

258
00:15:23,038 --> 00:15:24,318
Are you sure about this?

259
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:27,638
This seems pretty unrelated
to the Solitaire investigation.

260
00:15:28,018 --> 00:15:28,998
No.

261
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:32,918
They're getting a little too close
to each other lately to call it unrelated.

262
00:15:33,678 --> 00:15:38,458
The calamities are essentially dedicated
to their own goals from start to finish.

263
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:42,898
Aside from The Grocer, they never
got involved with other calamities.

264
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:47,298
But like with the mark of
that Sabaramond organization,

265
00:15:48,018 --> 00:15:50,278
their interests are overlapping too much.

266
00:15:50,938 --> 00:15:54,458
You mean Solitaire and Fire-breathing Bug
might already be working together?

267
00:15:54,598 --> 00:15:57,738
Yes, could be.

268
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:03,198
I strongly agree with your proposal.

269
00:16:03,238 --> 00:16:05,438
But on one crucial condition.

270
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:08,298
Interesting, what the condition?

271
00:16:08,538 --> 00:16:09,538
Um…

272
00:16:09,758 --> 00:16:11,498
The condition I speak of is

273
00:16:12,378 --> 00:16:15,338
you have to survive this somehow.

274
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:31,678
The years that have passed
will be remembered fondly in the heart.

275
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:40,418
-The time of departure has arrived.
-I was not expecting you to show up so soon.

276
00:16:41,338 --> 00:16:47,358
Farewell.

277
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:51,078
-Oh no!
-Lord Civil!

278
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:52,338
Oh.

279
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:56,258
So he ruptured the liquid fuel
in the air and ignited it.

280
00:16:56,658 --> 00:16:59,178
It must be a fuel mixture
of naphtha and napalm.

281
00:16:59,178 --> 00:17:01,538
That is, the contents of the napalm bomb
and the fuel of the flamethrower.

282
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:03,678
I didn't want it to be this way.

283
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:06,938
If so, its high temperature
would burn me to death.

284
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:08,738
It can't be. Tell me it ain't so.

285
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:12,518
I trust you have some minimal sense
of ethics, Fire-breathing Bug.

286
00:17:12,518 --> 00:17:14,078
Oh! This is looking really bad!

287
00:17:16,298 --> 00:17:18,038
Ha ha! Perfect timing.

288
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:19,898
I was just thinking I wanted
a chance to test this out.

289
00:17:20,818 --> 00:17:22,718
Is it like… this?

290
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,798
Whoa, you gotta be kidding me.

291
00:17:29,278 --> 00:17:30,878
That's it?

292
00:17:31,158 --> 00:17:35,058
Maybe I have to follow
the formal procedure.

293
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:45,138
Ha ha! I sympathize with bugs like you!

294
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:48,398
I've already deduced your true identities.

295
00:17:50,178 --> 00:17:53,448
100 years ago, my organization
was working on

296
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:56,218
an experiment to give
humans special abilities.

297
00:17:56,256 --> 00:17:57,376
PEEK

298
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:02,818
To keep it secret, they burned
all 18 test subjects to death.

299
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,058
But in the end, only 16 bodies were found.

300
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:06,858
That is to say, someone survived.

301
00:18:07,758 --> 00:18:09,418
And multiplied.

302
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:12,198
To carry out your grudge against us.

303
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:15,938
I don't know whether it was through
science or magic that you did this,

304
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:18,158
you've taken innocent
members of the public

305
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:22,318
and planted your thirst
for revenge within them.

306
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:24,658
What a relentless obsession this is.

307
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:27,098
However, in this way, you're doing

308
00:18:27,318 --> 00:18:33,138
the exact same thing the elders did
when they robbed 18 people of their lives.

309
00:18:33,478 --> 00:18:36,458
Looking at the numbers alone,
you're the brutal one.

310
00:18:36,718 --> 00:18:38,538
You're…right.

311
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,718
Thus,…we are…also sinners.

312
00:18:42,158 --> 00:18:46,058
We are nothing…more than
bugs…baked into this world.

313
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:49,898
Once we have burned…you to a crisp,

314
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:54,918
we will vanish…from within these people
and…burn ourselves as well.

315
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:56,138
Nice.

316
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:59,398
If that's your intention,
then I don't owe you a thing.

317
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:02,238
Come, let's crush each other!

318
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:04,818
Put our respective lives on the line!

319
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:07,338
What a cheap…threat.

320
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:11,418
A smoke screen? Not gonna work.

321
00:19:16,178 --> 00:19:18,658
A magic show
where the whole crowd disappears?

322
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,758
What? Did they get away?

323
00:19:21,198 --> 00:19:22,438
I see.

324
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:25,498
It seems they won't
act recklessly out of revenge.

325
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:30,218
They must have been
testing our combat abilities.

326
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:35,218
It's far better than thoughtlessly
flying into the flame like a moth.

327
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:36,838
What? Ngah?

328
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:41,278
This guy might know
where those guys' hideout is.

329
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:43,638
Humph, humph, humph, Lady.

330
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:47,878
Even if I did know, do I appear to
be the type to easily betray friends?

331
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,478
-You do.
-You do.

332
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:50,598
You do.

333
00:19:50,718 --> 00:19:51,958
Now. Hang on.

334
00:19:51,998 --> 00:19:55,278
Then allow me to share some
valuable information with you.

335
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:56,198
Information?

336
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:57,978
The expression
"A moth flying into the flame"

337
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:00,018
comes from a Chinese Liangshu Text.

338
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:01,698
And doesn't have to do
with military strategy or traps,

339
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:04,038
-Who cares?
-but rather with a story about a grandson outperforming his grandpa.

340
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:06,458
That's an interesting story,

341
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:08,738
but I want to hear something else.

342
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:14,058
Why did you go to that building
in Shinjuku after getting that symbol?

343
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:17,618
What is your connection to the diviner?

344
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:22,218
Hmph, so you've already reached
that conclusion as well, have you?

345
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:26,478
True, the moth who flies into
the flame is foolish.

346
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:30,218
But if it's a moth
who's resistant to fire?

347
00:20:30,878 --> 00:20:31,858
You!

348
00:20:32,658 --> 00:20:33,638
MISSED
Huh?

349
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,098
Moreover,

350
00:20:35,218 --> 00:20:39,178
there are some worlds you'll never see
unless you fly into the fire.

351
00:20:39,418 --> 00:20:41,538
I'm curious about your powers,

352
00:20:41,538 --> 00:20:44,098
but I am very busy tonight.

353
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:48,798
I hope that one day you will show me
the incredible world.

354
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,758
For that purpose, I'll appear within
the flames as many times as it takes.

355
00:20:54,978 --> 00:20:55,918
Wow.

356
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:56,978
What?

357
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:59,498
Coming to this country
was really the right choice.

358
00:21:00,518 --> 00:21:05,038
The thirst I've had my entire life
has been sated a little.

359
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,658
Nothing is making any sense to me.

360
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:11,838
Hey, boss. By the way, what was
that cannon-like thing you did before?

361
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:15,178
That wasn't the power
of the Lord Elf, was it?

362
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:17,718
I tried it out and it worked.

363
00:21:17,858 --> 00:21:19,478
"It worked," you say.

364
00:21:20,518 --> 00:21:23,408
So far, I've only been
able to use my magic

365
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,638
to strengthen my own body and mind.

366
00:21:26,098 --> 00:21:28,258
I was a failure from the start.

367
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,798
Didn't I tell you before
coming to this country?

368
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:33,418
About my pathetic origins.

369
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:36,658
This body was supposed to
have the memories and personality

370
00:21:36,658 --> 00:21:39,518
of a sorcerer from that other world
transcribed into it.

371
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:42,998
His name was Arius Sabaramond.

372
00:21:43,538 --> 00:21:48,058
They say the great sorcerer
never showed up in this world.

373
00:21:48,918 --> 00:21:52,758
However, the organization continues
to use his name to this day.

374
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:55,158
A product of Sabaramond.

375
00:21:55,658 --> 00:21:57,218
That's really ridiculous.

376
00:21:57,978 --> 00:22:01,198
I was still struggling
with that failed magic…

377
00:22:01,438 --> 00:22:02,398
When…

378
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:04,818
Yes, that's what triggered it.

379
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:07,028
It was the first time I had ever felt

380
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:09,338
the magical power within me
being manipulated by an outside force.

381
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:12,958
So I wondered whether I might be
able to do the opposite of that sensation.

382
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:14,378
And, luckily, I managed to do it.

383
00:22:14,438 --> 00:22:16,658
There you go, boasting about your genius.

384
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:18,638
As expected of you, Lord Civil.

385
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:21,298
Well, I'm still only at the threshold.

386
00:22:21,578 --> 00:22:23,698
Once I get used to the feeling,
I'll be able to do more.

387
00:22:24,398 --> 00:22:27,078
I like you and Lulu.

388
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:29,978
You let me feel the world beyond.

389
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:32,118
Don't go saying stuff like that suddenly.

390
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,238
Oh my.

391
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:36,258
But this world isn't as chaotic

392
00:22:36,258 --> 00:22:38,778
as I'd like it to be.

393
00:22:39,398 --> 00:22:41,218
I have always felt it.

394
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:44,078
This isn't where I belong.

395
00:22:44,718 --> 00:22:47,198
After all, I was born over there.

396
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:48,858
I want to go back.

397
00:22:49,258 --> 00:22:52,318
To the homeland of my memories
that I haven't seen yet.

398
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:56,778
If I can't go back,

399
00:22:57,098 --> 00:22:59,028
then at least, I wish for
something in this world

400
00:22:59,028 --> 00:23:01,718
to banish the boredom.

401
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:07,658
Oh, you actually know my phone number.

402
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,668
This is my first time
speaking to you directly.

403
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:11,138
Do you want me to make my introduction?

404
00:23:11,518 --> 00:23:14,278
No, no. That won't be necessary.

405
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:16,098
After all, you have been a patron

406
00:23:16,238 --> 00:23:20,618
of our store since even before we "moved."

407
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:23,338
Does the fact that you're contacting me

408
00:23:23,338 --> 00:23:25,658
mean the product is in stock?

409
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:28,038
The genealogy of Polka Shinoyama.

410
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:30,538
In particular,

411
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:33,758
information about his mother,
Kanon Shinoyama.
