1
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:04,572
Goodness.

2
00:00:05,112 --> 00:00:07,792
Snooping through HQ's confidential data?

3
00:00:07,792 --> 00:00:08,832
What were you thinking?

4
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:10,952
I know, I'm a disgrace.

5
00:00:11,232 --> 00:00:13,272
This is about
Prosecutor Hosorogi's case, isn't it?

6
00:00:14,092 --> 00:00:17,052
Quit getting so involved over
someone who's dead anymore.

7
00:00:17,052 --> 00:00:18,732
But… this is…

8
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:20,792
I'm telling you to keep your eyes
on the future.

9
00:00:21,412 --> 00:00:23,112
You've got to move on for
those who are gone too.

10
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:27,552
About your daughter…

11
00:00:28,292 --> 00:00:29,232
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:29,712 --> 00:00:31,452
Listen… Iwanome.

13
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:33,372
I'm living my life.

14
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:35,992
For my daughter's sake, not just my own.

15
00:00:36,892 --> 00:00:40,472
And I intend to fulfill my duties
until my dying breath.

00:02:18,323 --> 00:02:20,023
(Episode 18: The Revenge)
You're really something, Inspector Habaki.

18
00:02:20,583 --> 00:02:22,323
What happened to living for your daughter?

19
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:24,843
Did you even mean any of it?

20
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:26,823
Daughter?

21
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:29,063
Of course, I mean it.

22
00:02:29,643 --> 00:02:30,683
Hey, hey.

23
00:02:30,763 --> 00:02:33,823
You think that after I went so far as
to sacrifice my daughter to get here,

24
00:02:33,823 --> 00:02:36,243
I'd just give it up?

25
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:37,243
You gotta be kidding me!

26
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:40,903
Calm down, leader.

27
00:02:43,803 --> 00:02:46,103
This is still better than Lemmings, right?

28
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:48,283
You've got a point there.

29
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,943
Are you okay, Mr. Iwa?

30
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:53,203
Yatsu!

31
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:57,063
I started to get suspicious when I passed
a group of officers acting odd…

32
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:01,423
I scraped together everyone from Comps-3.

33
00:03:01,603 --> 00:03:02,663
We're not interrupting anything, are we?

34
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:05,063
Nice move, but I'll thank you later!

35
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:06,823
Huh?

36
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:07,763
Whoa, whoa.

37
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:09,703
Inspector Habaki?

38
00:03:11,043 --> 00:03:13,063
So, leader, what's he being charged with?

39
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:15,103
Glad you're so quick on the uptake.

40
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:16,583
It's about Mr. Hosorogi.

41
00:03:17,523 --> 00:03:20,463
Maybe I should thank Fire-breathing Bug?

42
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:23,063
Thanks to you. I made it in time.

43
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,063
A phone call?

44
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:27,163
To whom? That "Higuro" guy?

45
00:03:27,563 --> 00:03:29,303
Or someone else…?

46
00:03:31,763 --> 00:03:33,423
-Arase!
-Got it!

47
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,043
That's it! Keep that up-

48
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:41,243
A gun?

49
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:42,543
This is the headquarters.

50
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:44,703
Why can he carry a gun?
Who is he aiming at?

51
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:46,283
Get out of there, Pops!

52
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,683
-Good work.
-Yes, sir.

53
00:03:49,903 --> 00:03:52,623
We'll meet again on
the other side of the sky.

54
00:03:53,723 --> 00:03:54,763
I know that guy!

55
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:58,203
Darn it!

56
00:03:58,283 --> 00:03:59,443
No way, hey!

57
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:00,763
What are you doing-

58
00:04:01,423 --> 00:04:02,403
Don't!

59
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:08,423
What the hell is going on, Mr. Iwa?

60
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:11,963
Yatsu, you and pops go
after Inspector Habaki!

61
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:16,703
Hey.

62
00:04:17,043 --> 00:04:18,123
These guys are still…

63
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:20,303
I guess this is the end of the road.

64
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:23,703
I don't wish to…

65
00:04:24,023 --> 00:04:26,123
burn the righteous.

66
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:28,023
Wait, where am I?

67
00:04:28,023 --> 00:04:30,023
-Hey! Why am I being arrested?
-This is…

68
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:31,303
Ouch!

69
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:34,263
This feels familiar.

70
00:04:37,103 --> 00:04:38,483
I heard about this before,

71
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:41,023
but… So this is what it's all about, huh?

72
00:04:41,143 --> 00:04:42,743
You figured something out, didn't you?

73
00:04:43,323 --> 00:04:45,843
The Fire-breathing Bug must be one person,
and yet not one person.

74
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:48,663
Something just outside
the realm of common sense.

75
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:51,463
A hypnotist, perhaps?

76
00:04:54,183 --> 00:04:56,083
We should split up and search.

77
00:04:56,223 --> 00:04:57,263
Roger that.

78
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:01,003
Darn it. Kochou is gonna scold me later.

79
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:15,283
This has to be the place.

80
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,703
Yo, Habaki.

81
00:05:17,423 --> 00:05:19,423
Oh! Oh!

82
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:22,183
I can't believe it's really you.

83
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:24,163
When did you get to japan?

84
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,883
I just got in today.

85
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:28,363
Anyway, while I was looking for a hotel.

86
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:31,503
I heard that HQ got
an emergency call from you.

87
00:05:31,683 --> 00:05:35,623
Thank you for that power outage.

88
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,523
You're too good to me.

89
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:40,903
You don't have to thank me.

90
00:05:41,643 --> 00:05:43,663
You've done good work so far.

91
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:45,963
I expect you to keep it up.

92
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:47,883
Speaking of good work,

93
00:05:48,003 --> 00:05:50,963
you've managed to bring all sorts
of goodies to the organization.

94
00:05:51,403 --> 00:05:55,363
At the lab where they carry out the experiments,
but they're really only slaughtering people.

95
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:58,743
You even presented your own daughter
to them as a test subject.

96
00:05:58,743 --> 00:06:00,323
You're really Habaki.

97
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:02,023
Thank you for the kind words.

98
00:06:02,023 --> 00:06:06,163
I'm sure my daughter is rejoicing
from beyond the grave.

99
00:06:08,043 --> 00:06:09,003
Habaki.

100
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:11,423
You're mistaken on two counts.

101
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:12,483
What?

102
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,523
When I said "You've done good work so far.

103
00:06:14,763 --> 00:06:16,423
And I expect you to keep it up",

104
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:18,543
I wasn't talking about you.

105
00:06:19,543 --> 00:06:21,063
What?

106
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:22,203
Didn't I tell you?

107
00:06:22,763 --> 00:06:25,863
There's no need to thank me.

108
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:29,103
I've been wanting to
abandon you for a long time.

109
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:33,063
And your second mistake-

110
00:06:33,943 --> 00:06:35,663
"From beyond the grave"

111
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,523
is an expression used only
for the dead, isn't it?

112
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:44,503
It's been a while, Shitty Dad.

113
00:06:44,663 --> 00:06:47,283
N-No…It can't be.

114
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:49,683
You're Soara, aren't you?

115
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,063
That's right.

116
00:06:51,343 --> 00:06:52,743
She is Habaki Soara.

117
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:57,323
The daughter you gave over
to a product of Sabaramond.

118
00:06:58,343 --> 00:06:59,683
Or more accurately,

119
00:06:59,923 --> 00:07:02,863
the illegitimate child you don't know
how to deal with, so you tossed her.

120
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,303
You never even tried to get to know her,
so we never told you.

121
00:07:06,743 --> 00:07:11,023
Your daughter being the first case
to survive the experiments.

122
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:12,423
Congratulations to you.

123
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:16,403
Her codename is Arahabaki.

124
00:07:16,823 --> 00:07:19,063
She ranks higher even than you now.

125
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:22,043
She's asked me for a special favor.

126
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:27,203
She personally wants to execute the father
who treated her like a guinea pig.

127
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:32,683
I've thought about you
all this time, Father.

128
00:07:32,683 --> 00:07:33,903
W-Wait.

129
00:07:34,043 --> 00:07:39,263
I'll pay back all the pain I've suffered.

130
00:07:40,123 --> 00:07:41,843
Darn it!

131
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:51,143
Aww, what a touching
father-daughter reunion.

132
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:54,283
Ah, Lulu.

133
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:56,723
Ahh!

134
00:07:56,923 --> 00:07:59,243
What's wrong, Father?

135
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:01,503
This is only the tip of the iceberg…

136
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:05,743
Compared with the pain
I've endured for the past decade.

137
00:08:06,003 --> 00:08:07,143
I've

138
00:08:07,923 --> 00:08:09,083
made up my mind.

139
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
Even just once would've been fine.

140
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:16,183
If you had come to check
on me after the fact…

141
00:08:17,883 --> 00:08:20,683
Then I'd spare your life.

142
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:24,063
Lucky for me.
You're a cold-hearted bastard.

143
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:28,503
That's our target for today.

144
00:08:28,783 --> 00:08:29,743
Him?

145
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:32,883
I-I can still make it up to you.

146
00:08:34,403 --> 00:08:39,463
I'll find you the sorcerer who came
from the other side of the sky.

147
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,023
There's no way you could do that.

148
00:08:42,023 --> 00:08:44,403
Please just give me a chance!

149
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:48,543
I think you've made it pretty
far by only looking ahead.

150
00:08:49,023 --> 00:08:51,563
But really, you should've spared
at least a glance behind you.

151
00:08:52,123 --> 00:08:53,643
Like when it comes to Soara.

152
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:54,703
What?

153
00:08:54,763 --> 00:08:56,183
Or this very moment.

154
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:57,463
What do--

155
00:08:58,683 --> 00:08:59,723
Huh?

156
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:00,883
Was that a hit?

157
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,483
Clean headshot.

158
00:09:02,763 --> 00:09:05,143
We can ignore the girl with him.

159
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:06,523
Still…

160
00:09:06,623 --> 00:09:09,003
I can't believe she wanted to test
the skills of the Horojima siblings.

161
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:12,703
We are only allowed to snipe
that battered old geezer.

162
00:09:13,123 --> 00:09:16,943
Revenge from the Shinjuku intermediary
agency is really boring.

163
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,983
I'm off here.

164
00:09:19,223 --> 00:09:20,383
Could you get things ready?

165
00:09:20,723 --> 00:09:21,703
Yes.

166
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:25,383
Boss, give me an order.

167
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:26,643
Okay.

168
00:09:27,323 --> 00:09:29,803
You've got three minutes, Arahabaki.

169
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:31,383
Sicut vis (As you wish).

170
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:32,743
This is bad.

171
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,103
What is it?

172
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:35,743
Let's pull out of here.

173
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:38,423
Or at least lay low on the middle floor.

174
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:40,803
Too late.

175
00:09:41,023 --> 00:09:42,043
Huh?

176
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:43,363
She's coming right for us.

177
00:09:53,423 --> 00:09:54,503
Hey.

178
00:09:54,923 --> 00:09:57,783
It's you guys, isn't it? You peeping toms.

179
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:01,303
It's an emergency situation.

180
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,423
It seems like we're going to die.

181
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:06,963
Not yet.

182
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:10,783
I was only able to hurt him half
as much as I wanted to.

183
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:14,443
You took my life's revenge from me,

184
00:10:14,443 --> 00:10:17,503
so you're gonna make it up to me, got it?

185
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,143
Were you aiming for my eye? Good one.

186
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:25,283
Go.

187
00:10:35,123 --> 00:10:36,103
Tch.

188
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:41,723
So there's a whole family
of you peeping toms.

189
00:10:42,723 --> 00:10:44,043
They're from…

190
00:10:46,023 --> 00:10:47,863
Are we being watched?

191
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:50,343
Is this for all the backstabbing
and running away and stuff?

192
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:54,163
Clarissa isn't so foolish
she'd leave rookies on their own.

193
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:57,443
I really don't like her.

194
00:10:57,743 --> 00:10:58,723
You…

195
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:00,783
But we also got saved.

196
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:02,783
Thank you…

197
00:11:03,183 --> 00:11:04,163
So cute.

198
00:11:04,423 --> 00:11:05,643
Oh, you're really cute.

199
00:11:07,043 --> 00:11:11,023
Hmph, don't think I'll forgive you
just because you're cute.

200
00:11:11,603 --> 00:11:14,643
I've got a cutie in my gang too.

201
00:11:14,723 --> 00:11:16,423
Huh?

202
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:18,603
Where'd they go?

203
00:11:18,923 --> 00:11:21,303
Huh? Has it already been three minutes?

204
00:11:21,303 --> 00:11:24,923
Oh, no way! Darn it.

205
00:11:26,183 --> 00:11:27,343
Miss Clarissa.

206
00:11:28,123 --> 00:11:30,003
I apologize for dropping by so late.

207
00:11:30,263 --> 00:11:33,803
There's somebody
I desperately want to find.

208
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:36,463
I need your help.

209
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:38,723
L-Lisa?

210
00:11:43,795 --> 00:11:45,695
This is my first time meeting you.

211
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:49,395
You're Sayo Shinoyama?

212
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,735
Yes, you know me?

213
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,715
I only know that you are Polka's family.

214
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:56,515
Ah, Miss Clarissa.

215
00:11:57,655 --> 00:12:01,715
Sis Sayo and Mr. Rozan know about
Corpse God, just them, though.

216
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:03,595
I see.

217
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:07,555
Well, you're free to tell them
as much as you like,

218
00:12:08,355 --> 00:12:09,495
but just be careful.

219
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:12,935
You're the son of the wealthy Shinoyama.

220
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,955
If whoever was targeting
Polka Shinoyama found out,

221
00:12:16,155 --> 00:12:19,275
it'd lead to all sorts of trouble.

222
00:12:21,895 --> 00:12:22,915
What is it?

223
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:27,915
The intermediary agency has contacted
Polka Shinoyama and your younger sister.

224
00:12:28,395 --> 00:12:29,835
Remain on standby for now.

225
00:12:30,495 --> 00:12:33,615
if you notice anything unusual,
you can take action directly.

226
00:12:34,075 --> 00:12:35,115
Yes, sir.

227
00:12:36,595 --> 00:12:37,815
Lisa Kuraki.

228
00:12:38,915 --> 00:12:39,915
She really is a pain in the neck.

229
00:12:41,735 --> 00:12:42,875
I will be careful.

230
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:46,075
Then it should be okay if we speak here.

231
00:12:46,555 --> 00:12:47,555
Polka.

232
00:12:47,695 --> 00:12:49,175
Or, Corpse God.

233
00:12:49,715 --> 00:12:51,675
I have a job to ask of you.

234
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,155
Can you come with me?

235
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:55,935
Sure, but…

236
00:12:56,215 --> 00:12:58,535
I think something's happened
to Takumi and the others.

237
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:01,035
It is not a good idea
to leave Sis Sayo alone.

238
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:03,575
Ah, don't worry about this.

239
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,095
The young lady of the Shinoyama
is still at home.

240
00:13:09,175 --> 00:13:12,375
Please protect her well
until my associate gets back.

241
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,975
Hmph, wily fox.

242
00:13:17,035 --> 00:13:19,375
The police office has been
invaded by Solitaire.

243
00:13:19,575 --> 00:13:22,775
Officers who were not in their right
minds went on a rampage.

244
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:27,255
A gun was fired at an inspector
before the suspect turned it on himself.

245
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,095
Someone tampered with the power system.

246
00:13:30,235 --> 00:13:34,495
And during the blackout,
both Solitaire and Habaki got away.

247
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:39,895
Our territory has been intruded on far too
much in too many ways for one single day.

248
00:13:40,535 --> 00:13:45,215
Superintendent General, did you suspect
Inspector Habaki from the start?

249
00:13:45,495 --> 00:13:47,735
I hadn't narrowed it down to him for sure.

250
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:49,615
But I've known for a while now

251
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:53,715
that there was a traitor
among upper management.

252
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:55,315
Five years ago,

253
00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:57,935
I was one step away from
finally tracking them down.

254
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:02,575
The one who was closest to cracking
it disappeared along with the evidence.

255
00:14:03,815 --> 00:14:05,375
Could it be…

256
00:14:06,775 --> 00:14:08,255
You see anything?

257
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:11,875
Yes, it's someone who's recently died.

258
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:15,175
I can make it so only
those of us here can see him.

259
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:16,975
Please do it.

260
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:27,775
You've grown into a fine man.

261
00:14:27,995 --> 00:14:30,595
You're Inspector Habaki, right?

262
00:14:31,115 --> 00:14:32,895
It's taken me a while,

263
00:14:33,155 --> 00:14:36,295
but with this latest incident,
I've finally found you.

264
00:14:37,175 --> 00:14:38,155
Habaki.

265
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:44,695
Y-Y-You. I remember you. I remember you.

266
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:50,735
Y-Y-You're the one who made H-Hosorogi's

267
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:53,695
corpse-e-e d-d-disappear.

268
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:55,995
Yes, I'm terribly sorry about that.

269
00:14:56,835 --> 00:15:00,635
I killed him after
a long and tumultuous affair.

270
00:15:01,075 --> 00:15:03,635
Or at least, that's what
you'd wanted it to look like.

271
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:05,295
Habaki.

272
00:15:05,595 --> 00:15:08,455
He was on the short list of suspects…

273
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:10,935
But now he's dead?

274
00:15:11,135 --> 00:15:12,735
Was he killed by Lisa's man?

275
00:15:12,975 --> 00:15:14,735
But why in a place like this?

276
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,575
Ohhh! Ahhh!

277
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:21,815
I can't believe you would make mincemeat of
your lover's corpse without any hesitation, you deviant.

278
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:25,535
Getting rid of you, for me,
is the highest compliment.

279
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:28,675
I only have one question for you.

280
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:32,715
Who's the one who issued the order
to have Mr. Hosorogi killed?

281
00:15:33,135 --> 00:15:36,275
Y-Y-You think I'd t-t-tell?

282
00:15:36,355 --> 00:15:38,395
-Polka.
-Already on it.

283
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:47,435
Ohh! I'll tell you as a souvenir
from the netherworld.

284
00:15:47,435 --> 00:15:48,415
What did you do?

285
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:50,935
It's a spell to induce
a compliant state of mind.

286
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:53,815
Although it's far from brainwashing,

287
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:56,995
I've tipped the scales heavily in favor
of his abundant ego.

288
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:59,135
Yes.

289
00:15:59,615 --> 00:16:03,095
I have sacrificed so much.

290
00:16:03,315 --> 00:16:06,955
To the products of Sabaramond.

291
00:16:07,775 --> 00:16:10,355
You know Mr. Sabaramond?

292
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:13,415
Ohh… That power…

293
00:16:13,415 --> 00:16:16,355
Could it be that you're… you're…

294
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:20,655
the sorcerer
from the other side of the sky?

295
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:22,335
Are you looking for me?

296
00:16:22,455 --> 00:16:27,475
Ohhh! Now that great man will accept me.

297
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:30,875
And I'll show my foolish daughter as well.

298
00:16:31,075 --> 00:16:32,095
Daughter?

299
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:33,875
Yes, yes.

300
00:16:33,915 --> 00:16:37,555
I have given everything to them!

301
00:16:37,735 --> 00:16:39,955
Even my own daughter!

302
00:16:40,215 --> 00:16:42,475
She should be grateful!

303
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:45,935
Because she could die for
the organization and me!

304
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:49,715
But instead she seeks revenge on me!

305
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:51,515
What?

306
00:16:51,695 --> 00:16:54,555
Habaki's memories are
running through my head?

307
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,855
You're going to a dreamland.

308
00:16:58,215 --> 00:16:59,895
You should be thankful.

309
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,655
Under the influence of Polka, I…

310
00:17:05,015 --> 00:17:06,015
Polka?

311
00:17:06,555 --> 00:17:09,115
-Can you lend me some money?
-These are fragments mixed in with Habaki's memories.

312
00:17:09,315 --> 00:17:11,415
-You're a big shot in the empire now.
-Are these Polka's-

313
00:17:11,475 --> 00:17:13,555
No. Corpse God's memories?

314
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:18,335
Didn't you make a fortune
from the last war?

315
00:17:18,815 --> 00:17:23,175
After all, you have to feed
your mom and little sisters.

316
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,335
Right?

317
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,855
N-Now, don't be mean.

318
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:33,255
You would not starve them,
even if you do not care about me, right?

319
00:17:41,315 --> 00:17:43,695
Heh-heh, sorry.

320
00:17:44,335 --> 00:17:45,615
These fellas from Nyanild

321
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:47,935
said they'd give me more drugs

322
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:50,715
if I killed you.

323
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:54,075
So if you're going to hold a grudge
against anyone, blame those guys.

324
00:17:54,655 --> 00:17:57,935
Well, there's actually no need
to hold grudges.

325
00:17:58,215 --> 00:17:59,575
Not just you,

326
00:17:59,755 --> 00:18:02,595
my wife and
your little brothers and sisters…

327
00:18:02,675 --> 00:18:04,735
They're all…

328
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:07,655
They were sold for a decent price.

329
00:18:09,095 --> 00:18:12,455
The whole family's been
of use to me to the very end.

330
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:14,095
You should thank me.

331
00:18:16,835 --> 00:18:17,835
Huh? Huh?

332
00:18:17,835 --> 00:18:18,515
This is…

333
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:19,615
Miss Clarissa.

334
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,515
I'm still very calm now.

335
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:26,255
I should draw even more
information from that man.

336
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:28,335
I know this,

337
00:18:28,755 --> 00:18:29,755
but,

338
00:18:30,315 --> 00:18:32,195
may I do as I please?

339
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:36,295
Wha-Wha-What are you going to do?

340
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:40,755
You're the only one who can perform the
duties of the grim reaper in this world.

341
00:18:41,235 --> 00:18:42,695
Corpse God.

342
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:44,935
Do as you wish.

343
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,055
How does it feel, my dear friend?

344
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:02,095
For a necromancer like you to be
made into one of the undead.

345
00:19:02,735 --> 00:19:04,655
It was a curse designed
to destroy the body

346
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:07,195
in order to prevent it from reviving.

347
00:19:07,695 --> 00:19:09,475
I expect it was prepared by

348
00:19:09,635 --> 00:19:12,915
a corrupt holy woman from
the Geldwood Church.

349
00:19:13,435 --> 00:19:16,575
A technique to destroy
the soul was also applied, but…

350
00:19:17,015 --> 00:19:18,495
I know

351
00:19:18,735 --> 00:19:22,915
I did not raise your soul
to be so weak and frail.

352
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,835
Do not forget

353
00:19:24,935 --> 00:19:28,995
that it was only on a whim that
I revived you as an undead this one time.

354
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,915
Huh? Is my memory playing tricks on me?

355
00:19:32,615 --> 00:19:36,455
"How fortunate I was able to make his brain
into his soul core before it was destroyed."

356
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:39,155
I remember you saying that with
a huge sigh of relief.

357
00:19:39,695 --> 00:19:41,135
Your memory deceives you.

358
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:42,735
You sure?

359
00:19:43,435 --> 00:19:49,015
Then am I also misremembering
when you pleaded with Utsurojuza?

360
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:51,355
THIRD-RANKING IMPERIAL COURT SORCERER OF THE BYANDY EMPIRE,
Didn't you let him take back the poison

361
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:53,635
UTSUROJUZA
and curse that were about to eat away at his brain?

362
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:57,355
Your memory is
completely mistaken, Your Majesty.

363
00:19:57,895 --> 00:20:00,955
I think a medicine man
ought to examine you.

364
00:20:01,615 --> 00:20:03,195
Especially the head.

365
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,995
You're just the worst,
you beautiful old witch.

366
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,115
Hahaha.

367
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:11,655
Only you dare to call me,
the emperor, crazy.

368
00:20:11,955 --> 00:20:14,695
Not only do you have no comforting
words for your apprentice,

369
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:18,335
but then you call His Majesty crazy?

370
00:20:18,775 --> 00:20:20,435
You agree with me, right?

371
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:21,955
Corpse God.

372
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:24,115
Alright, alright. Utsurojuza.

373
00:20:24,215 --> 00:20:25,895
Let it be.

374
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:28,675
I'm not crazy,

375
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:32,075
but it's true that my head's unstable
and coming to a boil.

376
00:20:32,695 --> 00:20:33,695
My friend.

377
00:20:33,895 --> 00:20:36,735
It's all because
you were assassinated, okay?

378
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,715
Hmm? What's the matter?

379
00:20:39,895 --> 00:20:43,175
It takes some effort to make bones speak.

380
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:46,255
However, I understand
what he is trying to say.

381
00:20:46,795 --> 00:20:49,615
It's because you still
treat him as before,

382
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:52,175
so he is confused, Your Majesty.

383
00:20:52,815 --> 00:20:57,395
He feared you would cut off all relations
after seeing him as undead.

384
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,095
Oh?

385
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:02,055
Evidently underestimated.

386
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:05,795
I didn't mean me.

387
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:08,115
I meant you.

388
00:21:08,675 --> 00:21:12,395
And don't go thinking about getting
revenge on your dad.

389
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:16,175
There's no need for you to sully
yourself with that lowlife.

390
00:21:16,935 --> 00:21:18,615
Don't forget, my friend.

391
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:21,615
No matter what becomes of you,

392
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:25,215
I and the empire itself
will always be on your side.

393
00:21:25,915 --> 00:21:27,755
Rizdilusia Redrazalf.

394
00:21:29,235 --> 00:21:30,855
Ahhhh!

395
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:32,475
God don't play games.

396
00:21:33,095 --> 00:21:35,635
I believe that even now.

397
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:39,955
Playing around with people's lives
because of emotions

398
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:42,615
makes you as immature as me.

399
00:21:49,115 --> 00:21:50,855
How many times do I have to tell you?

400
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,935
There's no need for you to
sully yourself with this lowlife.

401
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,535
I don't remember summoning you here…

402
00:22:00,655 --> 00:22:01,655
Your Majesty.

403
