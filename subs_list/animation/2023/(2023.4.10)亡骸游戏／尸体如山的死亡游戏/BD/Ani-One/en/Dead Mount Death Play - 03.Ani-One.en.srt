1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,400
Ah… I can indeed see something

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,350
like skeletons beside the window.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,270
Although they are hidden in the smoke,

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,340
we can vaguely see huge bones.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,600
As far as the result is concerned,

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,900
the fact that the children were saved
is the greatest blessing.

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,070
Wow, amazing!

8
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,200
Something like this actually
happened yesterday.

9
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,350
Monsters really do exist!

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,770
Yeah.

11
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,450
I didn't expect that this kind of thing
would actually happen around me.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,790
(Dead Mount, Death Play)

13
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,220
Misaki,

14
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,320
are you really okay

15
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,900
to be with the person who killed you?

16
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,400
I was killed for the first time

17
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,800
and I feel so excited,

18
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,050
so there's no problem.

19
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,700
Right, you were

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,250
never quite normal.

21
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,270
By the way,

22
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,850
is Clarissa

23
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,400
also the owner of this building?

24
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,730
Well…

25
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,670
I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble.

26
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,500
Thank you very much for your help.

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,400
To be honest, I know almost

28
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:42,620
nothing about this world.

29
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,740
Don't thank me.

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Are you really planning to stay here?

31
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,820
SHAKUZAWA BUILDING

32
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,300
Although you were reincarnated,

33
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,340
that the owner of this body
still has a family,

34
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,750
so how are you going to handle it?

35
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,600
The owner of this body seems
to be on summer vacation now.

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,700
I told Polka Shinoyama's family that

37
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,470
I embarked on a journey to find myself,
which was just an excuse.

38
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,350
Clarissa said

39
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,970
all I need to do is send back
a postcard regularly.

40
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,670
Isn't this a scam to confuse people
about the death time?

41
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,520
But what should I do after
summer vacation is over?

42
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,450
For those family members,

43
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,370
I only know their names.

44
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,270
Can't you extract it from your brain

45
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,670
like the memory or something like that?

46
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,600
Language is something

47
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,620
that can be easily extracted

48
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,300
due to repeated use,

49
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,250
while retrieving memories is as difficult
as going back in time.

50
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,790
Moreover,

51
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,270
the impression left by recent memory
is too strong.

52
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,620
However, speaking of the other world,

53
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,250
after seeing those bone monsters,

54
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,850
I couldn't help but believe it.

55
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,700
But we still can't say for sure

56
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,770
if it's really another world.

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,070
After all, there are similar things
that exist in both worlds.

58
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,270
For example, this creature
is called a whale.

59
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,920
In my world,

60
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,270
it is recorded as a legendary beast.

61
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,300
But what's important to me

62
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,150
is whether the Geldwood Church

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,420
exists in this world.

64
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,270
Geld… What?

65
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:08,270
They are a group of people

66
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,770
who see me as an evil creature
and plan to eliminate me.

67
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,120
In my original world,

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,550
I was a huge skeletal monster.

69
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,170
Ah… that one.

70
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,320
What is your name in that world?

71
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,700
In the language of this country,

72
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,850
it should be called "Dead Body Shrine."

73
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,170
No, it should be "Corpse God."

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,600
Corpse God... What a cool name!

75
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,820
Is that so?

76
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,950
I am finally

77
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,400
able to live a peaceful life.

78
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,720
The only thing left to do

79
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,100
is convince the employer who
wants to kill Polka.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,370
Let me say this first,

81
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,850
neither Misaki nor I know
the identity of the employer.

82
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,920
Did you not ask Clarissa about it?

83
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,240
I asked.

84
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,470
But she insisted on her obligation
to keep confidential.

85
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,100
In exchange,
she waived my rent for this floor.

86
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,700
After all, using force to discover
the other party's identity

87
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,920
is my last resort.

88
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,270
First of all, I have to do something
on my own.

89
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,070
Clarissa also said that

90
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,750
she will not accept any more commissions
to kill me in the future.

91
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,950
You believe everything she says?

92
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,050
There are not only Sis Clarissa

93
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,070
as a middleman for assassins.

94
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,250
However, there should be very few people

95
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,420
who can kill someone like you

96
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,020
with exceptional strength.

97
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,170
But if it is Lemmings,
that would be possible.

98
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,420
Lammin?

99
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,820
Ah… let's not worry about it for now.

100
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,030
Speaking of which…

101
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,770
Hey, hey, this is really amazing.

102
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,570
How does it move?

103
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,910
Does it rely on button batteries?

104
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,400
Are you really okay

105
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,850
to be together with the person
who killed you?

106
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,650
After all, it's not me who was killed.

107
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:42,250
Is it really a good idea

108
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,600
to revive such a dangerous person?

109
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,150
No problem,
because the owner of this body,

110
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,950
Polka,

111
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,250
has already forgiven her.

112
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,650
I don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,500
Have you talked

114
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,820
to Polka's soul?

115
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,850
What do you mean by talk?
He is right there.

116
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,900
It is my drone that couldn't be

117
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,020
controlled yesterday.

118
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:04,520
Polka's soul

119
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,220
still lingers in this body,

120
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,250
so I transferred it into something nearby.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,720
Can it borrow your drone

122
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,270
until a new host is found?

123
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,520
Well…

124
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,370
Put that aside first.

125
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,960
You treat people's souls
like changing clothes

126
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,750
-on a doll…
-I don't deny that

127
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,170
human life

128
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,000
is just like toys and dolls.

129
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,150
This guy is really dangerous.

130
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,650
He truly regards

131
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,720
human life as a plaything.

132
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,850
I absolutely cannot let my guard down.

133
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,120
Next, in order to live a peaceful life,

134
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,600
I need to earn money quickly.

135
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,570
Are there any jobs I can do

136
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,950
in this world?

137
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,570
You could kill people
or rob them on the road.

138
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,850
I'm not very good at assassination.

139
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,350
Since you can kill me,

140
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,620
killing people shouldn't be
difficult for you.

141
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,670
I see.

142
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:54,920
Don't be misled by her.

143
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,320
A guest has arrived,

144
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,570
probably looking for Misaki.

145
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,520
Huh? Looking for me?

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,620
You're the assassin Zaki, right?

147
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,320
If I don't do something,

148
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,500
I'll be killed by a foreign assassin.

149
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,270
Can you help me?

150
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,470
What should we do?

151
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,560
I already have another job.

152
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,820
Please, if you don't help me…

153
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,870
I understand.

154
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,910
I accept this commission.

155
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,200
Hey kid, did you hear
our conversation just now?

156
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,950
Okay, since Polka said it's okay,

157
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,220
I'll take on your commission.

158
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,060
What is that guy

159
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,600
plotting?

160
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,280
According to the intelligence dealer,

161
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,680
they should all be asleep
in the inner part.

162
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,910
These assassins

163
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,440
are really careless.

164
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,000
They were the partners of Jimba
that you killed.

165
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,710
Rather than calling them assassins,

166
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,880
it's more accurate to say
they are a group of abnormal guys

167
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,170
who wiped out an entire family
of their target.

168
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,080
That uncle…

169
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,350
There was an ambush.

170
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,730
What kind of killers are you?

171
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,660
You're too weak.

172
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,750
Because we're not assassins.

173
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,400
Even so, our boss was killed by you.

174
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,170
It's really embarrassing for us.

175
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,260
Hey, send her on her way.

176
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,370
Oh, I see now.

177
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,020
You little brat followed us too?

178
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,950
I'll take on

179
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,530
your commission.

180
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,510
What did you say?

181
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,950
You should disappear with Zaki too!

182
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,820
By the way, I forgot to tell you that

183
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Misaki has already turned into a zombie.

184
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,330
A small injury won't kill her.

185
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,130
She should be much stronger than before.

186
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,390
What… You bastard!

187
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,970
Can you hear me, Polka?

188
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,800
Well,

189
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,200
should I say "hello" at this point?

190
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,700
Did you know it was a trap beforehand?

191
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,490
No,

192
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,200
I just accepted

193
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,510
the commission

194
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,170
from children that followed this guy.

195
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,880
Amazing!

196
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,890
What is this? It's so interesting.

197
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,350
What… What's going on?

198
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,680
Let go of me, you bunch of brats.

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,800
They can no longer harm anyone,

200
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,460
whether it's your father or mother.

201
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,490
Mom… Dad…

202
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,730
Sorry,

203
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,950
this isn't just about saving them.

204
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,330
Part of it is me venting my emotions,

205
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,550
so

206
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,640
I don't need any reward.

207
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:44,220
I have really healed
from where I was shot.

208
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,530
I have truly become

209
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,430
a "non-human monster".

210
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,330
But it seems like I've become duller.

211
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,820
It's the first time someone
shot me from behind.

212
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,280
Do girls in this world just
casually take off their clothes?

213
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,310
Polka,

214
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,260
why do you want to help those
deceased children

215
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,400
fulfill their wishes?

216
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,510
Isn't life just a toy for you?

217
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,200
It's true that ultimately human life

218
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,020
is someone's toy.

219
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,640
But I like toys

220
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,710
because they can make children laugh.

221
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,130
So how could I not value it?

222
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,150
I can never leave such a precious toy

223
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,970
to those who make children
suffer from the tragic fate.

224
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,710
Is that so?

225
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,880
This guy's different values

226
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,220
are not about his attitude towards life,

227
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,040
but rather his understanding of toys?

228
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,970
No wonder I can't agree with him.

229
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,420
Polka can indeed be considered
a dangerous person.

230
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,460
I don't care. This time you must die.

231
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,020
If you hadn't died,
the disposal agency,

232
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,080
wouldn't be able to get paid.

233
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,860
Misaki and I

234
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,910
are probably behaving more badly
than him.

235
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,370
Oh, sorry about what I said.

236
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,040
You don't have to be so polite with me.

237
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,220
If we count your past life,

238
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,510
you should be older than me.

239
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,400
That's how things are.
It's really troublesome.

240
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,150
Is that so? Thanks, Kuruya.

241
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,220
Huh? I really don't plan to take on

242
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,680
any more commissions to kill
Polka Shinoyama.

243
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,510
And I really hate

244
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,080
their condescending attitude.

245
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,910
As for those who escaped today,

246
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,110
I don't think we need to worry about them.

247
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,800
They seem to have

248
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,460
made too many enemies.

249
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,260
Damn it, I will definitely not spare

250
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,330
that monster.

251
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,000
Take all the weapons in the warehouse.

252
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,280
What's going on?

253
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,680
Could it be done by the monster just now…?

254
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:02,310
Hey, don't joke around
at a time like this.

255
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,060
Lemmings…

256
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,950
No way. Isn't that just

257
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,750
a legendary one?

258
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,110
In this world,

259
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,800
are vampires also just
legendary creatures?

260
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,280
Hey hey, do you have them over there?

261
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,660
That's great.

262
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,550
Vampires are very cool.

263
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,200
If you have magic,

264
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,660
perhaps you will evolve

265
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,330
sooner or later.

266
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,290
Is that true?

267
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,530
It's really just like a game,

268
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,110
is that a profession transfer?

269
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,970
Although I'm not sure
how long this game of playing

270
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,190
with the monster and zombie will last,

271
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,550
I'll just play along

272
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,260
with them for now.

273
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,130
It's a good distraction

274
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,710
from the boredom in my life.

275
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,710
Is that really okay, Clarissa?

276
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,640
What? Are you talking about Polka?

277
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,000
Can I take it that
your relationship with him

278
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,910
has become intimate enough
to call him Polka?

279
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,480
He is very fond of children,

280
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,550
so since he has this weakness,

281
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,950
I can easily control him.

282
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,280
Aren't you also fond of children?

283
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,000
Clarissa, you have a phone call.

284
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
It's me.

285
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,640
You really don't mind
being bothered, do you?

286
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,220
I should have explained this matter
to you yesterday.

287
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,510
Polka Shinoyama is just
a high school student, right?

288
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:35,680
Don't be ridiculous.

289
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,370
It's because I believed in such nonsense

290
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,770
that one of our aces here
has become a corpse.

291
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
I would like to take a temporary break

292
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,370
from our relationship.

293
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,080
At least until Polka Shinoyama

294
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,510
dies once,

295
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,260
and he is still just an ordinary
high school student.

296
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,710
That's hard to say.

297
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,330
Right now the most important thing is

298
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,000
that we have one less troublesome client.

299
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,750
Alright, let's celebrate.

300
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,200
This city has made my heart flutter
after a long time.

301
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,370
Be careful

302
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,040
when choosing your dance partner, Polka.

303
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,060
Please…

304
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,670
I already apologized to you.

305
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,170
I really don't have any money on me.

306
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,420
I didn't expect that a glass of beer

307
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,730
would cost 60 000 yen.

308
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,730
I heard that there are

309
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,930
more bars with extortionate charges
around here again?

310
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,710
Hmm, it seems like one of those bars

311
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:44,020
is on the fourth floor
of the nearby building.

312
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,820
Anyway, I can still drink good wine here

313
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,080
and the prices are about the same.

314
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,530
By the way, where is Clarissa?

315
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,440
She is working the night shift today

316
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,880
and will only come to work
in the middle of the night.

317
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,480
Is there something urgent

318
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,510
or did something happen
yesterday or today?

319
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,420
Well,

320
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,460
there shouldn't be anything important.

321
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,440
The fire that occurred at
Shakuzawa Building yesterday

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,110
has been widely discussed in my workplace.

323
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,440
It is said that skeletons were seen,

324
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,260
but what's so scary about it?

325
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,280
After all, don't all people turn into
skeletons after they die?

326
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,350
They could also become

327
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,520
wax corpses or mummies.

328
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,730
I prefer zombies.

329
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:33,060
I want to eat you alive.

330
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,730
Eliminate zombies… Smash their heads…

331
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,640
It is forbidden to touch
the waitress here.

332
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,600
But what will happen to

333
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,330
Misaki's body
after she turned into a zombie?

334
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,750
It hasn't been long

335
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,860
since she was shot.

336
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,730
Due to the effect of preventing decay

337
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,260
and repairing bodies,
she won't be affected much.

338
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,370
It's just that
she has more strength than before

339
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,480
and she may feel a little dull.

340
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,110
If she suffers serious injuries,

341
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,660
she can recover by eating raw meat.

342
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,040
That's what we call a carnivorous girl?

343
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,750
Sounds cool.

344
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,620
Is that so?

345
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:13,840
Additionally,

346
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,350
her saliva should have
a strong paralyzing effect.

347
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,020
I feel like my saliva tastes
sweeter than before.

348
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,860
One bite from her can
temporarily paralyze the opponent.

349
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,730
Polka!

350
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,620
It's true.

351
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,600
Look at you!

352
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,510
Do you want to try getting bit
by me as well, Kuruya?

353
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,460
This is a light bite from a girl.

354
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,550
It's like a kiss,
so you should feel happy about it.

355
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,640
Shut up, materialistic woman!

356
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,110
Materialistic woman!

357
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,370
I am the kind of man

358
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,820
who can firmly say no

359
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,080
to those conceited women

360
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,930
who believe their kiss

361
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,350
is a reward for all men.

362
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,080
This kind of woman is just like the man

363
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,350
who say things like, "As a reward for
meeting you, I'll make you my woman"

364
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,260
right off the bat.

365
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,240
Kuruya.

366
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,060
You are a monster born

367
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,110
in this modern society.

368
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,240
Monster.

369
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,150
Monster…

370
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,240
Speaking of which, does such
a monster exist in this world?

371
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,860
A monster with exceptional power

372
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,200
like the Calamity Crusher.

373
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,280
Is it really the sound of gunfire?

374
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,710
Not sure.

375
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,460
Since someone reported it,

376
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,710
let's come and take a look.

377
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,930
What's that sound?

378
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,000
What's going on with these people?

379
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,000
So

380
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,950
please say something.

381
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,930
I already apologized

382
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,680
to you!

383
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,350
Why are people calling me now?

384
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,130
I could have seen Clarissa

385
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,350
in just a little while.

386
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,660
It's really regrettable.

387
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,030
By the way,

388
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,350
is the world of Polka also
based on decimal system?

389
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,640
Yes.

390
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,110
That means humans there
also have ten fingers.

391
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,530
Well,

392
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,200
although there are individual differences,

393
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,750
most people have ten fingers.

394
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,800
You are guessing they use
the decimal system

395
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,200
just because they have ten fingers, right?

396
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,860
It's surprising that
you know these things.

397
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,350
Speaking of which,
even though it's a different world,

398
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,130
human bodies are surprisingly
similar to this extent.

399
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,240
Additionally, can the magic
from the other world

400
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,220
have the same effect here?

401
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,910
It seems so.

402
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,710
The world I once stayed in and this world

403
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,280
may be connected somewhere.

404
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,840
Otherwise,

405
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,910
many things wouldn't make sense.

406
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,260
Have you finally recovered from
the numbness?

407
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,460
Hmm.

408
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,580
Now I have another skill
of biting people in the future.

409
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,280
Why don't you just beat them?

410
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,860
I want to use this move to
immobilize my opponent.

411
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,880
Before, I used a nail gun to pin
them down on the ground,

412
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,680
but now I can save so many nails.

413
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,350
It is also
an environmentally-friendly move.

414
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,550
That's right. The more ways there are

415
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,170
to immobilize the opponents, the better.

416
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,440
You seem to have quite
a few means like that.

417
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,460
For example, you buried
those hooligans in the ground and even

418
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,750
saved trouble of dealing with
their bodies, which is quite convenient.

419
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,950
Huh? Those people are still alive.

420
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,970
But they have lost their sanity

421
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,260
and probably cannot
provide testimony anymore.

422
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,600
You're too impulsive.

423
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,060
Don't worry.

424
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,260
In order to avoid
accidentally killing people again,

425
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,710
I have been behaving myself this time.

426
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,820
Mr. Iwa, there's a strong smell
of alcohol on you.

427
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,220
It's much better than
the smell of blood on you.

428
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,710
How did you get covered
in blood like that?

429
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,770
This was self-defense
and I already apologized to them.

430
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,640
I thought they were going
to kill me instead.

431
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,930
To be killed?

432
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,930
So what's the matter?

433
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,910
I see.

434
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,030
Given this situation…

435
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,150
It's my first time

436
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
seeing human bodies tied up like this.

437
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,770
No wonder the Mobile Investigation Team
called us

438
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,350
before conducting their initial search.

439
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,820
As expected, this kind of thing falls
within our jurisdiction.

440
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,040
For this kind of supernatural event,

441
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,930
no other department is an expert.

442
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,600
In the end, we still have to do the work.

443
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Lemmings,

444
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,560
Grim Reaper,

445
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:48,260
Fire-breathing Bug,

446
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,800
and after those guys,
another calamity has emerged.

447
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,770
It really makes people excited.

448
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,530
TSUBAKI IWANOME, THE MANAGER OF SHINJUKU POLICE'S COMMUNITY SAFETY DIVISION MATERIALS COMPILING GROUP #3

449
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,570
KOZABURO ARASE, IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT

450
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,570
We will be busy.
