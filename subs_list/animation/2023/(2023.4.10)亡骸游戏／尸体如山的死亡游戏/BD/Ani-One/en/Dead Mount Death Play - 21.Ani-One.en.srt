(Episode 21: The Spirit)

3
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,039
The chief editor said he's very busy.

4
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,379
What should I do about
the interview story today?

5
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:40,559
Hey, you there, mister!

6
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:43,299
You've been looking
at that building, right?

7
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:45,719
Could it be that you're
interested in Phantom Solitaire

8
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,239
and the mysterious young diviner?

9
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:50,659
What did you say?

10
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,379
I see. So there's a journalist
investigating Polka.

11
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,319
Maybe she can get some information.

12
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:00,919
Stay with her without letting her in
on your true intentions.

13
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,139
Fine. I got permission.

14
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:06,219
Great, thank you!

15
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,639
Then let's get going.

16
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,779
Ugh, it's so cold.

17
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,139
What's this?

18
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,179
Like the cage of a wild beast.

19
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,159
It's more like the deep sensation of death

20
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:24,779
that I got when I was in the presence
of a complete t'ing-fu.

21
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:28,659
It's nearby.

22
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,179
Huh?

23
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,479
I have a really strong urge
to turn tail and go home.

24
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,779
Snap out of it!

25
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:43,579
Do you have business with Polka?
Or perhaps with Xiaoyu?

26
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,479
But now is not a good time.

27
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:47,099
They're still at work.

28
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,899
Um, Miss Sakimiya, right?

29
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,819
Huh? Kochou?

30
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,619
Do you know this man?

31
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,959
Why is it so freezing here?

32
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,319
Hmm, it might be a bit strange.

33
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,099
Miss Soara!

34
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:08,919
It's you, isn't it?

35
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:12,299
You're the assailant who's been
showing up all over the place lately.

36
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:13,879
Oh?

37
00:03:14,339 --> 00:03:16,719
What's this guy doing?

38
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,659
Need a hand, Arahabaki?

39
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:24,539
You're in a good mood, boss.

40
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:25,919
But

41
00:03:26,059 --> 00:03:28,439
I'll clean up my own mess.

42
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:29,739
Yeah?

43
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:34,539
I thought I'd strangled everyone around
the building to keep us from being seen.

44
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:37,259
But now the boss has shown up?

45
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,899
Taipei's made contact
with the cell phone thief.

46
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:42,519
Round one begins.

47
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,259
What? Are you sure about that?

48
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,619
The uniforms of Heilei operatives
are soaked in a special fragrant oil.

49
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,319
If she came close enough to strangle them,

50
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,599
the smell should be strong enough

51
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,299
to last even after bathing.

52
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,879
Taipei's sense of smell could
track it down even after ten days.

53
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:03,279
Why is he so eager to attack her?

54
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,939
To eliminate the enemies around
the young lady and her associates.

55
00:04:07,059 --> 00:04:08,439
Of course, this is just an excuse.

56
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,099
His rationale is more
base than an animal's.

57
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,399
He just wants a death match
against a powerful opponent.

58
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:22,879
Hey, hey. What is this?

59
00:04:23,299 --> 00:04:24,279
What's that sound?

60
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:27,299
Young lady, it's very dangerous here.
Please stay in your room.

61
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:28,719
Darn it.

62
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,859
What on earth is Taipei doing?

63
00:04:33,999 --> 00:04:35,919
The clients have been led out.

64
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:38,019

As long as Takumi is in his room,

65
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,659
FORTUNE-TELLING
he should be all right.

66
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,439
We going to help out either one of them?

67
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,759
First, get the journalist out of here.

68
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:46,879
Okay.

69
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,479
She remains unfazed
in the face of such a situation.

70
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:51,979
Could she also be a Shinoyama bodyguard?

71
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:53,919
Let alone her.

72
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,339
The Shinoyama have
some fine pawns on their side.

73
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:05,079
Lord Civil?

74
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:07,319
-Lulu.
-Y-Yes?

75
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,359
Come on, it's dangerous here.

76
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,639
This exclusive news
is too good to pass up.

77
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,099
At least one shot.

78
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,259
This way of using magic…

79
00:05:29,059 --> 00:05:30,619
Mr. Sabaramond?

80
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,599
Watch closely.

81
00:05:35,019 --> 00:05:38,599
That's the workaround used by
those who cannot speak with elves

82
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,759
to force the magic out of them instead.

83
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,159
They take the elf's magic
directly into their bodies

84
00:05:44,299 --> 00:05:46,159
and fill their own "vessel" with it.

85
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,679
If they can't withstand the magic
they steal from the elf,

86
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:52,159
their bodies will be contorted,
ruptured, and fried.

87
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:55,919
An elf eater.

88
00:05:56,099 --> 00:05:58,279
The first rank Imperial Court Sorcerer.

89
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,259
Arius Sabaramond is indeed well-deserved.

90
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:04,419
Haha.

91
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:07,159
You are mean, Easlies.

92
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,799
I certainly did not eat them.

93
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,039
I just temporarily borrow
the circulating power in this world.

94
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,259
Corpse God.

95
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,239
I envy you.

96
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,039
You are loved by many,

97
00:06:21,499 --> 00:06:23,079
including countless spirits,

98
00:06:23,239 --> 00:06:24,979
and even loved by witches
who hate mankind.

99
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,939
I hope you love them too.

100
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:29,399
As many people as you can

101
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:31,139
and the countless world.

102
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,179
Love is the miracle
that can conquer all else.

103
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,259
I can't get a handle on love.

104
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,149
And so, all I can do

105
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,139
BYANDY EMPIRE, FIRST-RANK IMPERIAL COURT SORCERER
pine for the world.

106
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,659
ARIUS SABARAMOND
pine for the world.

107
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:46,099
Alright, let's go back.

108
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,039
This is to cover the damage.

109
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,659
I can't accept something so…

110
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:55,859
Tsk.

111
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,599
Darn it. I was careless.

112
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,419
After you got him with that, boss,

113
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,279
at least a few of his organs
must be thrashed.

114
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:04,959
Didn't you dodge it?

115
00:07:05,059 --> 00:07:05,919
Tsk.

116
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,739
I am, after all, your bodyguard, boss.

117
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,119
What?

118
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:11,899
This is

119
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,899
the same treatment the imperial
assassination unit would give.

120
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,079
You've had to see some
pretty messed-up stuff.

121
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,879
But you're calm.

122
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:21,499
Oh.

123
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,919
I still have my face frozen
using the "false face" spell.

124
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:31,359
Due to my frequent peeking
into others' fates, I am used to it.

125
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,679
I see.

126
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,019
I guess Mikoto's evaluation was on point.

127
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,859
Anyway, I won't cause you
any more trouble.

128
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,299
At least not here.

129
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:43,919
Arahabaki, I leave Lulu to you.

130
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,859
-Okay!
-O-Okay.

131
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:51,759
Is it over?

132
00:07:52,059 --> 00:07:53,459
Seems so.

133
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:56,959
I've never experienced
an attack like that in my life.

134
00:07:57,359 --> 00:07:58,679
What did that guy do to me?

135
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:04,039
What was with that customer just now?

136
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:06,839
A product of Sabaramond.

137
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:11,619
I'm certain he's a member of that organization
Fire-breathing Bug was talking about.

138
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,439
What makes you so sure?

139
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,039
His face brought back memories.

140
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,899
But it's not really him.

141
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,319
Because the color of
the soul is different.

142
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,019
And he's younger than that person was.

143
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:24,939
But the way he used magic

144
00:08:25,459 --> 00:08:27,439
was too similar to call him a stranger.

145
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:29,099
Similar to who?

146
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:31,839
The former head
of the imperial court sorcerers,

147
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,939
Arius Sabaramond.

148
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:38,499
Huh?

149
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,039
Why'd you deal with him?
You could've just left him to me.

150
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,179
Sorry I snatched your prey from you.

151
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:51,219
I was just about to get a big fight.

152
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,799
Sorry, sorry.

153
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:56,959
I just figured it's okay
not to hide my power anymore.

154
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,379
Take this.

155
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:01,579
Huh? What am I going to do
with your passport, boss?

156
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:05,539
CIVIL A SABARAMONDO
Immigration paperwork is done using my full name.

157
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:08,199
So it's written right there.

158
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:13,079
An organization uses my surname
without permission.

159
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,139
The name Sabaramond.

160
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,599
Those geezers in the organization
went wild after they discovered this.

161
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,059
Hey, guys.

162
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:25,339
Have you heard of products of Sabaramond?

163
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:29,219
They are the villains who recently
shot at Phantom Solitaire

164
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:32,379
and infiltrated the police.

165
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,899
Word has it that the people
Fire-breathing Bug has been burning

166
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,879
are comrades of these guys.

167
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:41,099
Anyone who knows the truth,

168
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:42,739

IDOL, KANNAGI RYOUMA
This is a video of my concert.

172
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:55,239
But the face and voice belong to someone
I don't recognize. That's so weird.

173
00:09:55,319 --> 00:09:57,359
It's what they call a deep fake.

174
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:00,759
They used CG to swap the face
and voice with someone else's.

175
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,559
But who is this guy?

176
00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:05,339
Solitaire's son?

177
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,579
And he mentioned "Sabaramond"…

Oh, it's already trending.

179
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,919
I see.

180
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,099
No wonder the old farts at headquarters
are freaking out about this.

181
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:16,399
Right?

182
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:20,039
My name being registered at immigration
links it back to us too.

183
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:22,619
By the way, was that such a good idea?

184
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,019
Giving that diviner those jewels?

185
00:10:25,239 --> 00:10:26,959
Yeah, it's okay.

186
00:10:27,219 --> 00:10:30,299
Though, right about now, he's probably
realized he's lost out big on the deal.

187
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,779
I knew it. He's gone!

188
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,099
Huh? What happened?

189
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:38,079
I can still detect his soul.

190
00:10:38,619 --> 00:10:40,759
No doubt about it. He's been kidnapped.

191
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:47,987
It seems they made quite
a show of beating you up.

192
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,087
My apologies.

193
00:10:50,307 --> 00:10:51,547
Don't worry about it.

194
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,907
Thanks to that,
we know the face of our enemy.

195
00:10:54,207 --> 00:10:56,547
It's our turn to corner them.

196
00:10:57,487 --> 00:11:01,387
Um, is it really okay for us to take this?

197
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:05,307
Those jewels were meant
to cover the cost of this too.

198
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:09,667
I look forward to him
coming to get it back.

199
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:10,784
Right?

200
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:12,707
SO SHOCKED AND FROZEN SHARK

201
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:15,367
Why are you talking to a stuffed animal?

202
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:17,227
You never know.
Our fellow folk from back home

203
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:20,927
might be able to hear us
through this stuffed animal.

204
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,087
Huh?

205
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:23,447
I asked Lulu.

206
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,747
I asked who the elves most strongly
turned their attention toward.

207
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:32,067
The elves showed no interest in humans.

208
00:11:32,227 --> 00:11:36,527
Instead, they were calling out something
to this stuffed shark the whole time.

209
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:39,987
The guidance of the elves
is always so abstract.

210
00:11:40,627 --> 00:11:43,967
But never once has it come to nothing.

211
00:11:44,547 --> 00:11:48,167
It's possible that Polka Shinoyama
is under the influence of a visitor

212
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:52,487
from another world, or,
in other words, an otherworldly sorcerer.

213
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:54,112
BINGO

214
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:55,947
And the fact

215
00:11:56,047 --> 00:12:00,427
that the elves took an interest in this
means it might be a catalyst.

216
00:12:00,747 --> 00:12:02,347
A catalyst?

217
00:12:02,887 --> 00:12:06,127
Even though he went to such elaborate
lengths to dress as a fortune-teller,

218
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:09,187
isn't it strange he would carry this shark
around on his person like that?

219
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,567
Could something have been
delivering directions to

220
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:15,227
Polka Shinoyama
through this stuffed animal?

221
00:12:16,147 --> 00:12:18,347
I can't be sure until I know more.

222
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:19,807
But I'm almost certain

223
00:12:19,887 --> 00:12:21,887
this thing is a vital key connecting

224
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:24,167
the sorcerer to Polka Shinoyama.

225
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:26,848
YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE MARK
AND YET TOTALLY OFF

226
00:12:27,307 --> 00:12:28,887
In which case,

227
00:12:28,887 --> 00:12:30,307
I have to look into this.

228
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:32,807
And at the same time,
we have to protect it.

229
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:34,367
Protect it?

230
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:36,947
If this shark can truly link us

231
00:12:36,947 --> 00:12:39,087
to the other side of the sky,

232
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:42,787
then it might be the first
to be burned by the bug.

233
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:46,767
Why would that guy kidnap him?

234
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:48,307
I don't know.

235
00:12:48,907 --> 00:12:53,087
But it seems they haven't realized
it is the real Polka.

236
00:12:53,687 --> 00:12:57,087
Anyway, I detected his location
and put up a lookout.

237
00:12:58,007 --> 00:13:00,167
We have to figure out a way to save him.

238
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:04,967
May I have a moment, young master Polka?

239
00:13:07,427 --> 00:13:09,487
Um, I want to talk to you too.

240
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:10,747
Miss Kochou?

241
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:12,287
I'm very sorry.

242
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:15,187
I just went and brought this weirdo in.

243
00:13:15,307 --> 00:13:16,887
Weirdo…

244
00:13:17,247 --> 00:13:20,627
So it's because of you that he came here.

245
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,447
Why did you attack that guy earlier?

246
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:27,027
Not important. Pay it no mind.

247
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,507
Of course he's going to mind!

248
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:31,007
Just who were those people?

249
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:32,247
Young Master Polka.

250
00:13:32,447 --> 00:13:35,087
I'd like to ask you for a reading on this.

251
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,856
FORTUNE-TELLING

252
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:40,387
TAKERU SHINOYAMA
Polka? It's me.

253
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:41,767
Mr. Takeru?

254
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,087
Takeru?

255
00:13:43,327 --> 00:13:44,767
The head of Shinoyama Security…

256
00:13:45,207 --> 00:13:46,647
I've heard about the matter.

257
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:51,367
Those who attacked members
of my company before are very dangerous.

258
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:54,247
The reason Taipei suddenly
went on the offensive was

259
00:13:54,547 --> 00:13:57,427
because he feared something
might happen to you.

260
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,747
Well, it seems his concerns
were misplaced.

261
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:01,227
I see.

262
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:03,947
Thank you for your concern.

263
00:14:04,467 --> 00:14:07,507
And so, I would like you to divine

264
00:14:08,007 --> 00:14:09,667
who these people are.

265
00:14:11,947 --> 00:14:12,947
Understood.

266
00:14:13,167 --> 00:14:15,607
I'm not very good at finding people,

267
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:18,407
but I'll see if there are any clues.

268
00:14:18,647 --> 00:14:20,607
And one other thing.

269
00:14:20,987 --> 00:14:23,147
Solitaire uploaded a strange video.

270
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:24,327
What?

271
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:26,067
Anyone who knows the truth,

272
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:30,227
please comment
on this channel, Solitaire TV.

273
00:14:30,507 --> 00:14:33,607
Hehehe. What do you think? Not bad, huh?

274
00:14:34,087 --> 00:14:35,947
Why did you go with this footage?

275
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:38,807
A certain Sabaramond gang

276
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:42,007
will be surprised
if you're one of them, won't they?

277
00:14:42,127 --> 00:14:44,007
Perhaps, and?

278
00:14:45,687 --> 00:14:49,127
Are you implying I need another reason?

279
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,787
Ah! What is with this guy?

280
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:58,207
I finally see your human side.

281
00:14:58,627 --> 00:15:02,727
That's the first time I've yelled
like that since kindergarten.

282
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,307
I-I see.

283
00:15:04,407 --> 00:15:06,647
That was fast.
He switched modes in a heartbeat.

284
00:15:07,087 --> 00:15:09,167
Even if I could escape safely from here,

285
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:12,187
I'd have to get plastic surgery
and go on the lam.

286
00:15:13,207 --> 00:15:14,687
Is that a confession?

287
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:17,647
That you're a comrade of those Sabaramond?

288
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:21,167
Comrade? I wonder what they think of me.

289
00:15:21,427 --> 00:15:23,587
I'm just their errand boy.

290
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:25,607
Fire-breathing Bug.

291
00:15:26,027 --> 00:15:28,167
Why have you been going
around for 100 years

292
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,867
burning those associated with Sabaramond?

293
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:33,347
I don't even know this.

294
00:15:33,947 --> 00:15:34,927
Hey, guys.

295
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,227
Have you heard of products of Sabaramond?

296
00:15:37,747 --> 00:15:40,567
Even though they've been
burning things for 100 years…

297
00:15:40,927 --> 00:15:42,947
When they do act, it's so sudden.

298
00:15:43,687 --> 00:15:46,047
Those children have probably
caught on by now…

299
00:15:46,367 --> 00:15:51,087
that revenge should be taken indirectly
to tear down everything from behind.

300
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,987
In which case, I'll act too. Let's dance.

301
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:59,507
We'll welcome my little kid-assassin
and our new family member,

302
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,567
Miss Misaki.

303
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:04,707
A hundred years?

304
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:08,547
So does that mean most of them
are over 100 years old?

305
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:09,567
No.

306
00:16:09,787 --> 00:16:14,307
We are…about to disappear…from this world.

307
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:17,167
So, we are…

308
00:16:17,447 --> 00:16:21,607
not meant…to exist. Errors…Flaws.

309
00:16:22,267 --> 00:16:24,287
Bugs.

310
00:16:24,987 --> 00:16:26,807
Non-existent…burn marks.

311
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:31,127
We are the same…as the products.

312
00:16:31,427 --> 00:16:36,367
We are bugs…scorched into…the world.

313
00:16:38,627 --> 00:16:41,707
Fire-breathing Bug has been
operating for over a hundred years.

314
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,347
So, what we need to figure out is

315
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:48,747
why they hold such hostility towards
the Sabaramond organization.

316
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:49,847
IN ANOTHER GARAGE ON THE WEST SIDE
But…

317
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:52,667
Leader.

318
00:16:53,267 --> 00:16:55,007
I found a case that resembles this one.

319
00:16:55,207 --> 00:16:57,127
Oh, good job, Kayakusa.

320
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:00,907
Assuming Fire-breathing Bug's
use of fire seems to be

321
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:02,907
more than a sick fascination,

322
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,967
I figured whatever drives their revenge
might have to do with fire at its root.

323
00:17:09,127 --> 00:17:10,767
We might've hit the jackpot here.

324
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,147
What is this?

325
00:17:12,327 --> 00:17:14,867
A fire in Shinjuku a hundred years ago?

326
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:19,127
16 bodies were found in
the charred ruins of what appeared

327
00:17:19,127 --> 00:17:21,787
to be multiple joined jail cells.

328
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,687
Half of them are the bodies
of young children.

329
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:27,247
Disgusting.

330
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:28,807
It's odd.

331
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:31,667
No one mentioned that

332
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:35,547
for a major fire.

333
00:17:35,987 --> 00:17:36,967
Yes, indeed.

334
00:17:37,627 --> 00:17:39,327
This was in the police records,

335
00:17:39,487 --> 00:17:40,807
but was it reported
in the media back then?

336
00:17:41,487 --> 00:17:44,027
Go look through any newspapers
and major magazines from that time.

337
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:45,247
Yes, sir.

338
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:47,687
Arase and I will look into that Higuro.

339
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:49,467
What's the matter?

340
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:52,672
WICKED SMILE

341
00:17:54,487 --> 00:17:55,847
What's got into you?

342
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:59,427
No, sorry.

343
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:02,567
My emotions just
malfunctioned for a moment.

344
00:18:03,187 --> 00:18:04,467
Arase…?

345
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,887
It looks like there is a connection

346
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:09,527
SOLITAIRE TV
between Solitaire and that organization.

347
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:13,547
My emotions have collapsed.

348
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,147
It seems it will take some time to reboot.

349
00:18:16,967 --> 00:18:18,407
Who is this guy?

350
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:22,247
I knew Solitaire was searching
for Sabaramond too,

351
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:25,687
but has he still not made contact
with those three?

352
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:30,067
If the word "Sabaramond" is widely known,
then it will become impossible to tell

353
00:18:30,187 --> 00:18:34,347
whether someone claiming
that name is real or an impostor.

354
00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:36,447
What on earth is he thinking?

355
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:38,464
NO PLAN

356
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:41,927
Let's set aside this matter for now.

357
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,907
I have to get ready for the divination.

358
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:45,827
So,

359
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:50,567
how about we meet again in the evening
three days from now?

360
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:56,367
So he will have to adjust
before telling me about them?

361
00:18:56,907 --> 00:19:00,567
If he aims to bargain with
that foreign party, then…

362
00:19:01,747 --> 00:19:03,187
His mother,

363
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,407
Lady Kanon…

364
00:19:06,507 --> 00:19:09,847
Anyway, Taipei, weren't you about to have
your fortune told for a magazine article?

365
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:13,007
I wouldn't mind if that journalist agreed.

366
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:16,287
He's turning the choice over to me?

367
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:18,227
But this might be a good opportunity.

368
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:21,367
Solitaire and Sabaramond
are linked to this building,

369
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:25,247
or more specifically,
the Shinoyama family.

370
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:27,447
I need time to investigate.

371
00:19:28,047 --> 00:19:29,967
I don't mind either.

372
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:32,807
So what do you say
to six p.m. three days from now?

373
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,227
Understood. See you then.

374
00:19:35,327 --> 00:19:37,947
If we're done talking,
then I'll take my leave now.

375
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:39,447
Goodbye, Polka.

376
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:41,007
Oh, yes.

377
00:19:41,487 --> 00:19:45,267
Taipei, return to the office for now
so we can have your injuries checked out.

378
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:46,607
Yes.

379
00:19:51,187 --> 00:19:53,267
Bao, in the following three days,

380
00:19:53,507 --> 00:19:55,007
you go and monitor Polka's movements.

381
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:56,287
Roger.

382
00:19:57,827 --> 00:20:00,427
I leave Sayo to that bodyguard.

383
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,387
-Yochigi.
-Yes?

384
00:20:02,747 --> 00:20:05,287
Find me the three people.
Don't make any moves.

385
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,287
Just get a fix on
their comings and goings.

386
00:20:07,647 --> 00:20:08,647
Yes, sir.

387
00:20:08,827 --> 00:20:10,867
Try to acquire information from Polka

388
00:20:10,947 --> 00:20:12,627
about what they're after.

389
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,327
We must also conduct
our own investigation.

390
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:17,647
If situation permits,

391
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:19,887
they may make useful pawns for us.

392
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:24,297
Not only did you call us here so suddenly,

393
00:20:24,297 --> 00:20:26,027
but this isn't exactly
the warmest welcome.

394
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:28,037
About my impressions of that funny video,

395
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:30,347
I'd already told you in my email.

396
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,007
This is a message from the elders.

397
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:37,427
Lord Civil, they demand you leave
the country at once and go into hiding.

398
00:20:37,927 --> 00:20:39,567
And if I refuse?

399
00:20:40,187 --> 00:20:42,207
Now that Lord Habaki is missing,

400
00:20:42,387 --> 00:20:45,547
we take our orders from the elders.

401
00:20:45,987 --> 00:20:48,107
Huh? You want this to get violent?

402
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,847
We don't think that we can win
against you, Lord Civil, or Arahabaki.

403
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,107
But

404
00:20:53,247 --> 00:20:56,227
surely you want to avoid a stray bullet
accidentally hitting your attendant.

405
00:20:56,867 --> 00:20:59,567
Um. It's dangerous, so please stop this.

406
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:04,487
You fools.

407
00:21:04,587 --> 00:21:06,507
How dare you point a weapon at Lulu.

408
00:21:08,447 --> 00:21:11,367
I-Is this your power at work, Lord Civil?

409
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:13,967
Huh? You don't know?

410
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:16,667
What?

411
00:21:16,747 --> 00:21:20,387
Can't we go save the real Polka yet?

412
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:24,287
Yes. If we rush in carelessly,
it'll only blow up in our faces.

413
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:27,827
Especially that little girl
who was with them.

414
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,147
She's possessed by an elf.

415
00:21:31,007 --> 00:21:35,047
Even with just the one she has, she might
be able to destroy the entire city.

416
00:21:38,907 --> 00:21:41,307
The elders are so cold.

417
00:21:41,407 --> 00:21:43,387
I get wanting to keep
your trump card under wraps,

418
00:21:43,687 --> 00:21:46,627
but to think they'd keep elf
a secret from their own men.

419
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:53,567
Don't! Don't kill them!

420
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:55,047
Almighty elf!

421
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:39,952
