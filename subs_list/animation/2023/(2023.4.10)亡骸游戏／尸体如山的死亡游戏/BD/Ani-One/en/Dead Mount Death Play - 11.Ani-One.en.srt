3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,080
Is it okay if I fill out
this questionnaire in this manner?

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,460
I think it should be okay.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,340
Is the divination here
really that accurate?

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,580
Yes, it's really accurate.

7
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:19,400
-Really?
-Yes.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,388
This is my second visit here.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,420
After listening to
his divination last time,

10
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:25,860
I was convinced that the diviner
here is a true professional.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,840
He even mentioned my injured foot,

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,640
which only my colleagues knew about.

13
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,600
Wow, I'm so excited!

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,522
So, what did you find?

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,960
I spent the entire night
investigating that sign,

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,726
and the information I found was
intricate and complex.

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,300
However, I always feel like

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,480
it seems to involve internal
police affairs, making it difficult.

19
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,920
Moreover, Prosecutor Hosorogi
disappeared at a crucial moment

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,711
while investigating this matter.

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,152
WELL, ALTHOUGH MOST OF IT IS CORRECT, I WAS ALMOST KILLED WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO CATCH HIM, AND THEN ENDED UP LIKE THIS

22
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:04,512
THE ASSASSIN THEY HIRED SHOULD HAVE KILLED ME IN THIS BUILDING

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,240
That means…

24
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,707
Since even the prosecutor was alarmed,

25
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,999
doesn't it indicate that the criminal
is within the police force?

26
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,936
SORRY, I CAN'T GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION UNTIL WE'RE SURE WHO THE CULPRIT IS. IT WOULD IMPLICATE YOU ALL

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,100
But haven't we already been
involved in all of this?

28
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,200
I'm actually fine.

29
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,237
If it causes problems for the real Polka
and the Shinoyama family…

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,808
Hmm, you also care about
their safety, right?

31
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:34,880
YES, THAT'S RIGHT. "ACT WITH CAUTION" MEANS EXACTLY THAT

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,400
This is indeed related to
that person named Hosorogi.

33
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:41,427
Could there be an issue
within the police force?

34
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,400
Who exactly are these mischievous kids

35
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,820
fighting against?

36
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,480
Xiaoyu, I'm hungry.

37
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,407
I will prepare food for you right away.

38
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:53,314
However, they have always had awkward
pauses during their conversation,

39
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,565
and I have also heard the sound
of a pencil writing.

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,704
I HAVE ALREADY TOLD THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID

41
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,106
Are you referring to
the police officer named Iwanome?

42
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:06,082
ALTHOUGH THIS IS SOMETHING UNFINISHED ON MY PART,

43
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,712
I CAN ONLY TRUST HIM, WHO HAS SEARCHED TOGETHER WITH ME, WITH THIS CASE

(TENA SORIMURA, SPECIAL INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT)
Solitaire is incredibly elusive.

49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,600
As the person in charge
of this investigation,

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,770
I am well aware that
my description is not precise.

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,023
(TENA SORIMURA, SELF-PROCLAIMED MAGICIAN)
However, based on

52
00:04:00,023 --> 00:04:01,523
(TENA SORIMURA, SELF-PROCLAIMED MAGICIAN)
the introduction just now,

53
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,775
I believe you all can understand the
reasons why I have to express it this way.

54
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,100
However, we have found that
the suspect has a habit of

55
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,840
actively approaching and
observing targets that interest him.

56
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,740
In other words,

57
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,200
as long as we investigate the sign
he has set his sights on,

58
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,206
there is a high probability
that we will encounter Solitaire.

This group of troublemakers
has all gathered together.

62
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,583
Previously, they and the prosecutor caused
havoc within the police organization.

63
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,112

the audacity to show up in front of us.

You are currently at
the crossroads of destiny.

67
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,166
I can sense the fluctuations.

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,480
The ship you are on

69
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,063
is about to collide with a hidden reef
adorned with illusory grandeur.

70
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,341
Before it sinks,

71
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,580
it would be best for you to find
another ship where you can seek refuge.

72
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,040
You managed to guess everything correctly,

73
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,540
even though I didn't mention
any of it in the questionnaire.

74
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,640
However, these are all the experiences

75
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,280
(SPECIAL LECTURE: THREE BIG SECRETS OF THE WORKING CLASS! 1. HE IS ACTUALLY TENA SORIMURA!)
of the real Shota Yamanoura.

(3. THE REAL YAMANOURA IS JUST AN ORDINARY PERSON AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SOLITAIRE!)

77
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,804
What he said was nothing more
than a hot reading technique.

78
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,420
All of these should have been
done by Takumi Kuruya,

79
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,679
the hacker that Granny talked about.

80
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,180
He was able to uncover falsification
of accounts of Mr. Yamanoura's company

81
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,180
in a short period of time,
even before it was reported in the news.

82
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,780
This is truly remarkable.

83
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,936
But what's disappointing is this diviner.

84
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,859
He's just an ordinary person.

85
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,097
Huh, were my words just now
really that hurtful?

86
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,471
Well, alright.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,120
Do you have any more questions?

88
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,538
Other things I wanted to ask…

89
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,568
Well…

90
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,448
Recently, there has been
a lot of buzz about Solitaire.

91
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,780
He promised to offer 300 million yen
to anyone who solved that sign's puzzle?

92
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,140
I wonder if you could use divination
to find out the origin of that sign.

93
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,710
This is beyond my divination.

94
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,960
I know it's not possible
given your abilities.

95
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,403
However...

96
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,430
I can sense that the sign
is a bit peculiar.

97
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,367
Peculiar?

98
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,398
It seems to have been added
with something extra.

99
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,220
Now I will use the profound power
of wandering souls' destiny in this world

100
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,367
to discover its true shape.

101
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,421
What?

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,480
Wow, this is really something.

103
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,347
These strong lines do not appear
to be controlled by threads or magnets.

104
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,360
Compared to divination,

105
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,140
this arouses more interest
in me as a magician.

106
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,276
The original sign

107
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,577
was missing a horizontal stroke.

108
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,171
This is my final divination result.

109
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,646
Gotcha!

110
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,860
I actually managed to find it.

111
00:06:56,658 --> 00:06:58,460
Wait a moment.

112
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:00,320
If he is truly a member of
the mysterious organization,

113
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,831
how could he reveal
such information to me so easily?

114
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,240
I need to stay calm!
This must be some kind of test on me!

115
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,880
I got it.

116
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,026
If I keep talking, I'll be doubted.
So let's stop here.

117
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,900
However, I also have my own principles.

118
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,065
I cannot simply turn a blind eye

119
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,183
to this misdrawn sign.

120
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,420
However, unless I point out to Solitaire
personally, it has no significance.

121
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,520
CRITICAL HIT

122
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,813
Is that so?

123
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,767
I will take it as a reference.

124
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,200
Then I'll take my leave.

125
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,460
-Oh, there's one more thing.
-What is it?

126
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,461
Do you have an impression of

127
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,622
a girl sitting in a wheelchair
with braided hair?

128
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,940
I couldn't make out what she was saying.

129
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,485
But she seemed to show concern

130
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,503
about the path you were on.

131
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,535
Her spirit body actually took
the shape of a wheelchair.

132
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,451
This only happens if one spends
a lot of time in a wheelchair.

133
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,380
But I can't talk to her anymore.

134
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,300
It should be my guardian spirit
or something like that.

135
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,360
I will think about it

136
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,998
and come up with a solution.

137
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,020
Then it appears that I do not need to
force her to ascend to heaven.

138
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,540
You have succeeded in arousing
my interest, Diviner.

139
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,960
I thought he was just a fraud

140
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,240
who used hot reading to pretend
to have supernatural powers.

141
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,260
But how did he know about the kid?

142
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,083
What exactly did he see?

143
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,510
Wow, it really lives up to its reputation.

144
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,380
He is adorable.

145
00:08:43,598 --> 00:08:45,920
You only pay attention to the appearance.

146
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,700
Ah, it's raining.

147
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,169
Oops, I didn't bring an umbrella.

148
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,000
Then let me lend you my umbrella.
I still have my raincoat.

149
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,092
If I get caught in the rain,
my disguise makeup will be ruined.

150
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,244
I really admire the energy
of young people.

151
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,490
I see.

152
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,351
You seem to have noticed this
as much as I did.

153
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,820
However, it is a coincidence

154
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,760
that I was asked
the same question twice today.

155
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,183
But, speaking of which,

156
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,191
(EXERCISE CAUTION WITH FIRE)
I cannot stand the girl's

157

choice of raincoat.

00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,157
We have dispatched
hundreds of investigators

160
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,400
to conduct road inspections

161
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,613
and retrieve surveillance footage

162
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,470
in order to pinpoint
Solitaire's movements.

163
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,800
However, we still do not know

164
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,160
what his ultimate objective is.

165
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,100
His current interest is…

00:09:55,552 --> 00:09:57,184
(TENA SORIMURA, SELF-PROCLAIMED MAGICIAN)

167
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,536
Do we want to lure
the snake out of its hole?

168
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,400
Only a very few people know about

169
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,760
the difference between
that sign and the original one.

170
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,720
But this matter cannot be
disclosed here, right?

171
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,435
Yes. We still don't know who the enemy is.

172
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,927
Whoever made that person disappear without
a trace must be a formidable opponent.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,211
If we casually drop the bait now, there's
a possibility of being counterattacked.

174
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,538
Although my primary job is to investigate
the whereabouts of Solitaire,

175
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,113
if I try to focus on more than one thing,
it will throw me off track.

176
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,934
Once Solitaire is captured, progress
will be made on all other matters.

177
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,809
And you should be pleased

178
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,360
that there are more people
available to be mobilized.

179
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,580
You exhaust us

180
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,620
while you sip your coffee.

181
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,119
Someone who once lagged
behind in his career

182
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,400
has unexpectedly made it to the top.

183
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,077
Thank you for your compliment.

184
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,187
Thanks to your blessings,

185
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:55,772
I now have at least the authority
to command you all.

186
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,870
Moreover, since you still have
the energy to complain to me,

187
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,563
it seems that you haven't reached
the level of being completely exhausted.

188
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,930
Don't get too carried away.

189
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:09,959
You were Hosorogi's sidekick before this.
You had many detractors.

190
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,532
Oh, I see.

191
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,634
I thought that
those corrupt police officers

192
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,711
who can no longer openly
engage in private misconduct

193
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,005
would be the only ones to resent me
because of the internal review.

194
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,160
Be clear about your status

195
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,140
and behave properly
within your jurisdiction

196
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
instead of swaggering around here.

197
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,200
Why do you always rely on
your official titles to make a point?

198
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,080
Are you so insecure that
you can't speak without them?

199
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,060
What a ridiculous habit.

200
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,100
Even junior high school students on
the internet are better than you.

201
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,760
What did you say?

202
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,325
Calm down.

203
00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:49,420
What are you doing? Let go of me.

204
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,906
Arase, I'm fine.

205
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,190
Arase.

206
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,794
I told you that I am fine.

207
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,420
Folks,

208
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,060
let's refrain from engaging in such acts
of bullying the weak, alright?

209
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,740
Arase, don't forget that

210
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,880
you have previously conducted
an illegal undercover search.

211
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,300
You should be well aware of the
consequences if any trouble arises again.

212
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,020
We have the ability to fabricate charges
against you out of thin air if we wish.

213
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:27,780
No way. I've already been punished
for the undercover investigation.

214
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:31,200
Mr. Tozawa gave me
a severe reprimand as well.

215
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,000
Ah, I found you!

216
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,220
Mr. Iwa, I did not expect you to be
slacking around and picking fights.

217
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,240
Oh dear, be careful.

218
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,795
Are you okay?

219
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,280
Oh dear, is this the way you
fabricate false charges?

220
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,220
It's truly vexing.

221
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,540
You took advantage of being tripped and
purposefully dislocated your own shoulder.

222
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,726
Fortunately, I'm here to help you fix it.

223
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:59,020
If it were Arase, he wouldn't know
how to handle it.

224
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,357
It's fixed.

225
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:05,376
SHINJUKU POLICE'S COMMUNITY SAFETY DIVISION, ASSISTANT MANAGER OF MATERIALS COMPILING GROUP NO.3, DANJO TOZAWA

226
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,737
Ah, what a stroke of luck!

227
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:09,600
Fortunately, nothing major happened.

228
00:13:09,888 --> 00:13:12,672
ALSO A MEMBER OF MATERIALS COMPILING GROUP NO.3, WINNER OF THE SHINJUKU POLICE STATION ARREST TACTICS TOURNAMENT INDIVIDUAL COMPETITION, RANMARU YATSU

229
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:14,250
I JUST STOPPED ARASE IN A COOL WAY, DIDN'T I?

230
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,820
POP TOZAWA, YOU SAW IT TOO, RIGHT?

231
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,238
What are you all doing?

232
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,860
Isn't this Chief Superintendent Habaki?

233
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,805
Nothing serious.

234
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,600
We're just providing emergency treatment

235
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:26,464
to our colleague who fell down.

236
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,284
Isn't that right?

237
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,343
Yes, it is.

238
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,010
Then we'll take our leave.

239
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,020
So, what exactly happened, Iwanome?

240
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,207
I get the whole situation.

241
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,000
Although those guys were at fault first,

242
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:50,420
you shouldn't provoke them
too much either.

243
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:55,083
The Solitaire video incident
has caused police unrest.

244
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,380
You mean that there is a traitor, right?

245
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,247
Yes, the higher-ups

246
00:13:59,247 --> 00:14:03,126
seemed to believe that the sniper incident
was orchestrated by Solitaire himself.

247
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,420
But it's better for you to avoid trouble
as much as possible.

248
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,049
Even in my position,
I have limited ability to protect you.

249
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,900
I am grateful

250
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,701
even if you can only provide me
with limited protection.

251
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,432
I'll take my leave then.

252
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,910
You need to be more careful.

253
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,160
Although it's currently
just my speculation,

254
00:14:26,274 --> 00:14:28,180
this matter may be related to

255
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,420
the Lemmings and other calamities.

256
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,506
That's truly frightening.

257
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,785
So, the more trustworthy people
we have, the better.

258
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:38,820
-Old man.
-Well.

259
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:42,180
I was actually going to tell you

260
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,084
not to deepen the conflict between
you and headquarters.

261
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,300
I think that person simply dislikes you.

262
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,874
Whatever, Yatsu.

263
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,220
However, our Comps-3 mission
remains unchanged,

264
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,510
which is to wholeheartedly
protect the city's safety.

265
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,593
We have to fight against

266
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,300
those crazy calamities until the end.

267
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,180
I can't believe even the Lei family's
intelligence network

268
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,191
couldn't find the whereabouts of Hosorogi.

269
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,560
Footsteps on the roof?

270
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,452
Oh, every time I land from the roof,

271
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:22,247
I feel incredibly excited.

272
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,320
This excitement stems from
the guilt of committing a crime

273
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,560
or

274
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,255
the tension of potential enemies
lurking ahead.

275
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:33,020
No, no, not at all!

276
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,300
It is a kind of intoxication.

277
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,040
Since the copyright to the works

278
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,660
of the great writer Edogawa Ranpo
has also expired,

279
00:15:40,849 --> 00:15:44,060
I suppose I can even call myself
"The Fiend with Twenty Faces"

280
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,854
without causing offense.

281
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,300
Hold on a moment.

282
00:15:48,523 --> 00:15:51,104
This could be considered offensive
to fans of Ranpo, right?

283
00:15:51,104 --> 00:15:52,288
AND IT SEEMED QUITE OFFENSIVE…

284
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,325
What do you think?

285
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,760
I didn't expect such a warm welcome
right from the start.

286
00:16:00,201 --> 00:16:02,880
It seems my intuition is correct.

287
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,480
So, can you please tell me

288
00:16:05,707 --> 00:16:08,400
have you been affiliated with
any particular organization?

289
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,015
And tell me about that sign!

290
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,360
Corpse God diviner.

291
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,400
No, I should call you Polka Shinoyama!

292
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,560
Please do not compare me to that weak guy.

293
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,780
Who are you?

294
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:26,080
AT THAT TIME, POLKA

295
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,449
Bamboo cage, bamboo cage.

296
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,320
Oh, little bird in the cage,

297
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,893
when will you come out?

298
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,424
On the eve of dawn,

299
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,249
both the crane and the turtle slipped.

300
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:09,854
Who is the person behind me?

301
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,500
Hurry up! The army has been
devoured by the sinkhole.

302
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,900
Where is General Daryl?

303
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,580
Their entire force has been taken away
by the Lewd and Cruel Dragon!

304
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,576
Did they escape? That's why I said
not to trust the Dragon Clan.

305
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,540
-What about the Prince and the Queen?
-What are you doing, foolish apprentice?

306
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,369
There are barriers around us
that hinder understanding.

307
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,799
Otherwise, we would definitely be involved
and sent to the front line.

308
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,127
You ask why I don't go?

309
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,180
I simply don't want to destroy myself
with that bunch of foolish people.

310
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,237
I've asked Romelka to help as many people
as possible that we know well.

311
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,582
What Utsurojuza said is right.
It's time to stop.

312
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,029
You should also get ready.

313
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,980
You ask what I get ready for?

314
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,653
Get ready to break free from
the shackles of the Empire

315
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,195
and live a free life from now on.

316
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,751
I have already made you

317
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,840
possess the bones of an elderly person,

318
00:18:05,243 --> 00:18:08,100
but your mentality still
resembles that of a child.

319
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,041
Forget it.

320
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,291
You will gradually mature in the future.

321
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,384
We have unlimited time.

322
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,284
However, in contrast,

323
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,020
we should try our best to cherish

324
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,732
those who live within
a limited time frame.

325
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,260
I'm sorry.

326
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,951
I'm sorry, Master.

327
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,700
I failed to act according
to your instructions.

328
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,258
I failed to protect them,

329
00:18:37,066 --> 00:18:38,526
failed to save them,

330
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,605
and failed to let go of this matter.

331
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,416
I have tarnished the abilities
you imparted to me.

332
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,680
I am ashamed to face
the people of the Empire.

333
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,698
I have become the enemy of the world.

334
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,762
I have escaped from my own world.

335
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,440
I no longer have the ability
to cherish anything.

336
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,261
You are still so foolish,

337
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,851
my dear friend.

338
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,680
Your Majesty.

339
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,300
Alright, alright, I have already awakened.

340
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,640
It seems like there's a smell
of something burnt.

341
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:31,871
What is it?

342
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,680
Are you still afraid of ghosts?

343
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,557
No, if it's the work of a ghost,
I can sense it.

344
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,613
It's still warm.

345
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,320
Hello there.

346
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,966
Are you Polka Shinoyama?

347
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,892
Who are you?

348
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:00,240
Hello?

349
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,561
Are you…

350
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,907
a product of Sabaramond as well?

351
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,995
Why? Why do you know this name?

352
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,431
So that's how it is.

353
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,600
They're really malicious,

354
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,445
dragging me into this destined prank.

355
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,459
"They"? Who are you referring to?

356
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:33,660
I recall this guy is the wanted criminal
everyone is talking about right now.

357
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,563
He didn't even react!

358
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:37,600
Who exactly is this child?

359
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:40,880
Despite my mysterious speech,
I do not know what to do next.

360
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,360
I need to calm down and think.

361
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,153
Forget it.

362
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,806
Once I catch you,

363
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,040
I'll slowly interrogate you.

364
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,002
Don't be in such a hurry, young man.

365
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,940
You're still young.

366
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,420
It's already 3 a.m.,

367
00:20:57,623 --> 00:20:59,480
and the child should go back to sleep.

368
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,011
I'm already nineteen years old.

369
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,200
So fast!

370
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,966
Indeed, this is definitely not something
a child could be capable of,

371
00:21:09,552 --> 00:21:11,580
but it's not at a level
where it's unavoidable.

372
00:21:19,145 --> 00:21:20,771
Huh?

373
00:21:32,575 --> 00:21:33,743
Has he started to act?

374
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,140
However, it is slightly different
from what we expected.

375
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,592
I didn't expect that the joyful offender

376
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,540
would actually fight with
my grandpa's personal bodyguard.

377
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:49,217
Let's start taking action as well.

378
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,880
How can we reap the benefits

379
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,571
in the midst of a melee?

380
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,240
This often plays a crucial role

381
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,806
in controlling chaotic situations.

382
