1
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:05,240
I worked as a salaryman
for a toxic company,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,950
until I reincarnated...

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:11,120
in a crazy world where everything is
dropped by monsters in dungeons.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,870
In my new life, I'm level 1,
but I have a unique skill

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,910
that puts all of my drop rates at rank S.

6
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,790
And today I'm...

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,960
swimming in rare drops during
a battle for a new dungeon!

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:28,680
But for some reason,
I'm just not okay with this drop!

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:45,280
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
EVEN AT LEVEL 1

10
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
THIS DUNGEON BATTLE
IS A VORTEX OF SCHEMES

11
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,270
I have to burn the trash right away.

12
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,620
Are you okay?!

13
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,080
I'm fine...

14
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:24,330
You can't use any more magic.

15
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,920
You need to rest.

16
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,840
They're... depending on me to do this.

17
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,930
So... I have to...

18
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,100
I've seen it all too often.

19
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,850
People get so overwhelmed by responsibility
that their health crashes,

20
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,480
their spirits are crushed...

21
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,100
Some people even die.

22
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,400
But... this is all I can do.

23
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,570
Sorry to make this about me,

24
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,030
but I don't want to see
that happen again.

25
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,080
Yoda, what was that?

26
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,630
When two healing bullets fuse,
they become a sleep bullet.

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,710
I'm making her get some good sleep.

28
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,430
That's for the best.

29
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,480
It's already so late?!

30
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,160
I'm too late!

31
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,010
Wow...

32
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,390
Sorry to keep you waiting!

33
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,350
Please bring all the trash over here!

34
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,730
What a great haul of homing bullets!

35
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,820
Line up, please!

36
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,980
Oh! Miss!

37
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,110
You should get some more sleep.

38
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,990
She's right.
Let us handle things here...

39
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,660
Oh, did you wake up
because you're hungry?

40
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,580
Huh?

41
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
What?!

42
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,920
Don't worry about the trash.

43
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,130
We moved this tent closer
to the collection site.

44
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,420
Eat up before it gets cold!

45
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,690
Delicious.

46
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,650
You cry when you eat
something delicious?

47
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,690
Just like Yoda!

48
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,780
You're just like him in the way
you push yourself too hard.

49
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,280
Really?

50
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,200
I can tell.

51
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,920
We haven't asked your name yet.

52
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,340
My name is Celeste.

53
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,710
I see.

54
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,630
So the dungeon drops are tax-exempt
until its ownership is decided.

55
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,560
That's why so many adventurers are
here even at this time of year.

56
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,640
Yes, and they produce more
and more trash every day.

57
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,230
That's way more
than one person can handle.

58
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:35,150
We'll help you out when we have time.

59
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,860
Thank you so much!

60
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,570
This is the only work I can do...

61
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,490
There's nothing else?

62
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,960
She fell asleep.

63
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,380
She finally gets to share a little of
the burden she's been carrying alone.

64
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,510
And the relief was so great,
she fell asleep.

65
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,730
That's way more powerful
than it was yesterday!

66
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,270
Her color is much better now, as well.

67
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,520
She looks much prettier today.

68
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,940
You're right.

69
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,320
Since you gave me a chance to rest,

70
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,160
my magic recovered to an
even greater level than normal.

71
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,830
But you'll return to how you were
if you overwork yourself again.

72
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,790
We have food and a bed.

73
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,830
Please stay in our tent
until this event is over.

74
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,170
But... I couldn't possibly
ask more of you.

75
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,010
That tent is far too comfortable,
so if I stay...

76
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,850
That's thanks to Emily's unique skill.

77
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,600
You can't escape it!

78
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,520
What an incredible skill...

79
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,360
I will stay with you for a while, then.

80
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,780
That settles it.

81
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,660
I'm going to go say hello at the Secro HQ.

82
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,910
I'll go with you as far as the shops.

83
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,790
We'll be back by lunchtime.
You can head back to the tent.

84
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,420
Now that I look at it again,
this place really is its own little town.

85
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,970
Why are you selling these here?

86
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,180
You'd be surprised how well they sell.

87
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,900
Lots of men who've come here to work
buy them as gifts for their wives.

88
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,980
The most expensive one
is a million pilos?!

89
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,690
I definitely couldn't afford that.

90
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,070
They're so beautiful!

91
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,490
You like this sort of thing, Emily?

92
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,830
I think rings are just lovely.

93
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,370
They're too expensive
for me to buy, though.

94
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,500
But rings are just... special, you know?

95
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,880
Thank you for coming here, Mr. Sato.

96
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
I'm Duke, the man in charge here.

97
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,550
It's a pleasure to meet you.

98
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:07,010
Same here.

99
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,090
Now, take a look at this.

100
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,890
It's a sketch of Selen, the new dungeon
Secro and Hetero are fighting over.

101
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,930
So it has ten floors...

102
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,310
We already know
what drops are found there.

103
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,570
Vegetables on odd-numbered floors,
and meats on even-numbered floors.

104
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,020
An even split?

105
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,860
Yes, so we can't decide based on that.

106
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,820
That's why we decided
that the side whose floors

107
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,780
yield the most rare drops
within the time limit wins.

108
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,080
Got it. I'll go right in and—

109
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,380
You don't need to go hunting.

110
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,710
Adventurers who find rare monsters
on the vegetable floors

111
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,919
will capture them alive and wait for you.

112
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,000
Huh?

113
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,000
It's the most efficient way.

114
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,510
We've solicited help
with the promise of reward money.

115
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,430
We just need you to focus
on getting us rare drops.

116
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,260
They built up this
whole plan around me?

117
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,520
That never would've
happened in my old world,

118
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,270
but this really seems worth doing.

119
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,480
They've got a rare one!

120
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,690
On the first level!

121
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,320
As long as it's in our custody,
we have the option to kill it.

122
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,990
Take all the time you need.

123
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:13,910
Got it.

124
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,040
Who are they?

125
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,170
The older man is Harvard.

126
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,500
He holds the same role in Hetero's
Dungeon Association that I do in Secro.

127
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,300
Next to him is Eugene, an adventurer.

128
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,640
He's renowned for his skills,
but his plant drop rate is at rank F.

129
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,180
Why bring an adventurer
with F-ranked drop rates?

130
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,390
He'll defeat rare plant monsters,
and they probably won't drop anything.

131
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,610
That'll leave fewer chances
for us to find rare drops.

132
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,570
So he's here to sabotage us?

133
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,700
Exactly. But we've already got
the initiative this time.

134
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:57,280
Hold it still.

135
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,870
Hurry up, would you?!

136
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,000
There! Now it's—

137
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,550
What's happening?!

138
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,930
That one won't die unless you destroy
the core hidden somewhere in its body.

139
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,890
Attack it anywhere else,
and it'll bounce back even stronger.

140
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,600
I know exactly where its core is.

141
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,440
Now it's first come, first serve!
Go, Eugene!

142
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,540
You're mine!

143
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,890
You can see its core, too?!

144
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:58,010
Yeah, something like that.

145
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,640
The rare drop, soybean sprouts, is ours!

146
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,560
That gives us a head start!

147
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,770
Damn!

148
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:13,110
Here's your reward.

149
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,740
Put it somewhere safe.

150
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,740
You're giving me this much?

151
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:19,490
It's an appropriate amount,
given your contribution.

152
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,380
The soybean sprouts we
got are yours, as well.

153
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,850
You can exchange them for money
at the trade post.

154
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,630
This is incidental income
I wasn't expecting.

155
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:34,170
Maybe now,
if I can do that one more time...

156
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,510
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

157
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,640
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Where did Emily go?

158
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,260
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Here I am!

159
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,680
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

160
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,060
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
I can't see the director's face anymore!

161
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,100
I'm back.

162
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,560
Welcome back.

163
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,150
You've had a very long day.

164
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,490
Was the dungeon-conquering job difficult?

165
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,660
Yeah. Hetero's using an adventurer
with F-ranked vegetable drop rates

166
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,820
to kill our chances at rare drops.

167
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,830
Wow, that's how they've chosen to fight?

168
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,330
But I actually finished that early.

169
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:09,250
I'm late because I made
a stop on the way back.

170
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,010
Oh! You bought the ring
we saw this morning?

171
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,260
It really is beautiful!

172
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,840
Emily...

173
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,930
Huh?

174
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,850
Would you accept this?

175
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,680
Wha... What?!

176
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,350
I mean, you help me out all the time.

177
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,350
But it's too expensive...

178
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,360
I got incidental bonus pay. And...

179
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,240
I was able to make good
money on the first level.

180
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:41,410
When you said rings are special,
I started to think...

181
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,830
What's special to me is that I met you.

182
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,500
That's why I want to give you this.

183
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,890
Thanks for everything, Emily.

184
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,680
No present has ever made me this happy.

185
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,100
Thank you.

186
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,520
They all have "+1" next to them!

187
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
I've never seen this before!

188
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,900
Is it because of your power?

189
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,490
Uh, actually...

190
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,360
The guy told me he had more
of the same ring in stock,

191
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,370
and I was really curious as to
what kind of stray would emerge

192
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,290
from a million-pilo ring, so...

193
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,710
It's pretty easy to make a profit here,

194
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:35,210
so I tried it and just bought
another if it didn't work.

195
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,630
And I ended up getting back
the same kind of ring,

196
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,470
but with an effect attached.

197
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,640
That's so like you, Yoda.

198
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,180
Let's go test it out.

199
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,140
Right!

200
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,760
SELEN LEVEL 2

201
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,260
SELEN LEVEL 2
This level's okay?

202
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,190
SELEN LEVEL 2
Yes.

203
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,900
Oh, there's one! A Treant!

204
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,330
Ooh, a chicken breast?

205
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,040
I really got a drop!

206
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,790
You're that happy about it?

207
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,090
I've always wanted to get a meat drop,
even if only once!

208
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,050
This is my first one ever!

209
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:27,720
My animal drop rate was at rank F.

210
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,730
F is just one rank below E,
but there's actually a huge difference.

211
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,480
People whose drop rates are
all F are known as "F Final,"

212
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,980
and some dungeons don't
even permit them entry.

213
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,570
Really?

214
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,830
Go get Harvard! He should be nearby!

215
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,910
Is that this floor's rare monster?!

216
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,330
Emily!

217
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,620
I'm okay!

218
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,290
You—

219
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,290
Good!

220
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,590
Go on, shoot.

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,180
You seem to have very good drop rates.

222
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,010
Please go ahead
and kill this Treant Beard.

223
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:12,020
If I kill it, it'll definitely
drop something,

224
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,190
and that'll bring Hetero's
score even with Secro's.

225
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,360
What's wrong?
Aren't you going to kill it?

226
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,150
None of us would mind if you did,

227
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,860
as long as the spoils drop on this floor.

228
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,200
I can tell just from looking at him
that his animal drop rate is high.

229
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,460
Damn it! What do I do?

230
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,750
Yoda!

231
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,430
Of course!

232
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,540
Thanks, Emily.

233
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,880
I remembered what you said last night.

234
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,760
Without this ring,
my animal drop rate is F.

235
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,010
Very smart of you to come up
with that on the spot!

236
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,800
I'm glad I could be of use.

237
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,010
All that time thinking about
how I could help was worth it.

238
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,730
Mr. Sato.

239
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,060
I hear you did some quick thinking
for us on the second level.

240
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,060
Thank you.

241
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,440
It wasn't me. It was my partner.

242
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,740
This adventurer has just earned
some reward money, then.

243
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,570
We do have a bit of a problem now, though.

244
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,250
Hetero's backup adventurers
will be here by tonight.

245
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,210
That will triple their numbers.

246
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,040
So they'll fill up the
floors that drop meat?

247
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,170
The reverse.

248
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,920
They plan to fill up
the odd-numbered floors,

249
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,839
the ones with vegetables,
with F-ranked adventurers.

250
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,300
But that's...

251
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,680
I guess our only choice is
to fight fire with fire.

252
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,520
No, let's finish this before
the end of the day.

253
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:23,400
If we get rare drops on
floors 3, 5, 7, and 9,

254
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,980
we'll be tied with them
at the very least, right?

255
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,740
If we could do that,
we'd effectively win, but...

256
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:34,410
Raise the reward for finding rare
monsters all the way to ten million.

257
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,200
What?! That's too much!

258
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,120
If we pay that much and then don't get
a rare drop, it'll be a huge loss!

259
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,500
I have a 100% chance of
getting that rare drop.

260
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,830
Still...

261
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,250
If I kill it and nothing drops,

262
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:48,090
I'll pay you the same amount back.

263
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:55,850
All right.

264
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,140
I can't believe we've
actually come this far!

265
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,640
SELEN LEVEL 3
The rare form of level 3's monster,

266
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,110
SELEN LEVEL 3
the Killer Butterfly, is the Evil Butterfly.

267
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,190
SELEN LEVEL 3
It drops Brussels sprouts.

268
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,530
SELEN LEVEL 5
The rare form of level 5's

269
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,360
SELEN LEVEL 5
Danger Bear is the Danger Panda.

270
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
SELEN LEVEL 5
It drops saltwort.

271
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,990
SELEN LEVEL 7
The rare form of level 7's

272
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,620
SELEN LEVEL 7
Mad Golem is the Rock Golem.

273
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,790
SELEN LEVEL 7
It drops daikon radish sprouts.

274
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,620
It kinda sucks that all these
"rare drops" are so basic,

275
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:27,090
but in any case,
we're done once I kill this thing!

276
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,920
One of its heads is its weakness,

277
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,800
but every time it regenerates a head,
its weakness changes!

278
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,550
It's a royal pain to fight
this thing legit, but...

279
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,860
Enoki mushrooms...

280
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,280
The last one's as lame as the rest.

281
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,570
You did it!

282
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,950
There's no way we can lose now!

283
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:02,370
In fact, we might
as well say we've won!

284
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,120
All thanks to you, Duke.

285
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,640
No need to be modest!

286
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,210
I'll go report your achievement
to HQ right now.

287
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,760
I'm not being modest.

288
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:18,800
At my old office, every suggestion
I offered was rejected.

289
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,180
But you were on board with my idea
to devote a budget of forty million to this.

290
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,400
SELEN LEVEL 1

291
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,060
Whether we win or not,

292
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,440
I just made a big purchase,
so I'd like to make a little more money.

293
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,580
What do you want?

294
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,000
You've gone too far.

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,210
All of these guys, and myself,
have F Final drop rates.

296
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,970
If we could have stopped Secro,
the money would've been ours.

297
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,260
But thanks to you,
we're no longer needed.

298
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,020
This magic circle has the same
effect as a magic storm.

299
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,480
You can no longer
use your projectiles.

300
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:12,360
I won't take your life...

301
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,450
But I won't rest until I make sure
you can no longer do your job!

302
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,870
So long as I don't worry
about being efficient...

303
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:31,670
I'm stronger
when I don't use my guns.

304
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,470
If you can use them, go ahead—

305
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,550
You can use them?!

306
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,140
I've used them
during a magic storm before.

307
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,440
Huh?

308
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,820
The pain is gone...

309
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,370
This one's loaded with special bullets.

310
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,410
It works just like healing magic.

311
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,710
You...

312
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,960
You probably won't believe me,

313
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,260
but I understand how you guys feel.

314
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,260
So if you can't rest otherwise,
attack me all you want.

315
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,850
If you get hurt doing it,
I'll fix you up each time.

316
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,190
But I won't lose, either.

317
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,610
Because I have someone waiting
for me to come home safe.

318
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,110
I get it.

319
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:40,490
I envy you for having someone like that.

320
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,700
I didn't always have her.

321
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,280
You might find someone
of your own someday.

322
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,710
I'm back.

323
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,080
Welcome back!

324
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,250
Oh, welcome back.

325
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,750
We've been waiting for you!

326
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,630
Dinner is already on the table.

327
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,430
I've come... home.

328
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,060
We... can see that.
