1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,780
I worked as a salaryman
for a toxic company,

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,820
until I reincarnated...

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,660
in a crazy world where everything is
dropped by monsters in dungeons.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,410
In my new life, I'm level 1,
but I have a unique skill

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,750
that puts all of my drop rates at rank S.

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,630
And today, I'm moving...
for the second time!

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,000
And then...

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,170
What?! A metallic me?!

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,420
And I meet yet another new girl...

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,430
What the heck
is gonna happen this time?!

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:45,280
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
EVEN AT LEVEL 1

12
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
THE ARRIVAL OF ALICE

13
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,490
Good morning, Yoda.

14
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,950
Morning...

15
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,950
Huh?

16
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,250
Celeste?! What happened?!

17
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,160
Good morning...

18
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,540
She says her head hurts.

19
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,090
A headache?
Did you catch a cold?

20
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,010
No. It's a magic storm.

21
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,720
A magic storm?

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,220
The natural phenomenon
that prevents people from using magic?

23
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,600
Whenever there's a magic storm,

24
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,430
my head throbs with pain
and feels heavy.

25
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:45,480
The storms make some
magic users feel that bad?

26
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,520
I'll be fine as long as
I just carry on normally.

27
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,900
After the storm passes,
I'll feel better.

28
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,240
Well, then, instead of going back
to the dungeon today,

29
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,860
let's go look at bigger houses.

30
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,540
Yeah... One big enough that she won't
feel sick during magic storms.

31
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,460
Are there any houses that can soften
the effects of a magic storm?

32
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:11,300
This is the only property I have today
that meets all of your criteria.

33
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,720
My headache's cleared up!

34
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,970
Really?

35
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:22,220
Yes! I didn't know some
houses had such effects!

36
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,150
This property was built using the latest
magic storm-blocking construction methods,

37
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:32,410
which should be very reassuring
for any magic user.

38
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,570
The kitchen is its own room,
and it's so big!

39
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,160
What do you think?

40
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,490
It's fantastic!

41
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,160
How much does this cost per month?

42
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,500
Since it was built with all
the latest technology,

43
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,500
the rent is considerably higher
than the market price.

44
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,330
It's 400,000 pilos.

45
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,420
400,000 pilos?!

46
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,340
Not a problem. We'll take it.

47
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,840
Wait, Ryota! We couldn't...

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,760
It's fine.

49
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,180
"A house where Celeste
and Emily can always smile"

50
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,680
was at the top of my list of

51
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
- criteria for our new house.
- Rabbit...

52
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,480
Besides, when I saw
how much better you feel now,

53
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,470
I couldn't even think
about any other options.

54
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,290
Well, let's start moving in!

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,830
Seems like the magic storm's over.

56
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,870
Yes, and aside from that...

57
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,800
Emily's a force to be reckoned with.
All this in one day!

58
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,300
You said it.
Emily really is amazing.

59
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,680
What shall we do today?

60
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,350
Carrot!

61
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,600
The harvest festival's coming up soon.

62
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,770
I think we should follow the list of
high-priced items Erza gave me

63
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:55,260
and look for rare monsters
on level 7 of Telulu.

64
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,360
Carrot...

65
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,660
Yeah, we'll get some carrots
while we're at it.

66
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,950
Forgiven!

67
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,580
Breakfast is ready!

68
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,750
All right! Let's eat a delicious meal
so we can give our all today!

69
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,500
Yes!

70
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,830
Absolutely!

71
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,340
Carrot!

72
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,460
TELULU LEVEL 7

73
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,470
TELULU LEVEL 7
Snow?

74
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:21,510
Inside a dungeon?

75
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,220
It's dungeon snow.

76
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:27,060
Depending on how they're made,
some dungeons have floors where it can snow.

77
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,390
I see...

78
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,480
You always seem to have
all the info, Celeste.

79
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,320
Huh? I-I wouldn't say that...

80
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,190
Yay! He praised me!

81
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,700
Well done!

82
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,210
I am intensely moved right now!

83
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,920
Captain...

84
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,170
It was so hard, wasn't it?
You suffered so much!

85
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,090
I know all about it!

86
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,970
I feel the same way!

87
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,680
Every time you two felt pain,

88
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,180
I felt it right along with you!

89
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,520
You were suffering, too, Captain?

90
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,930
I don't matter one bit!

91
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,400
You two endured the stress
and grew stronger for it!

92
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,360
I'm proud of you!

93
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,400
Captain! The same goes for us!

94
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,070
We're so glad we followed you!

95
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,780
Their brainwashing's complete.

96
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,200
Yoda?

97
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,620
Nothing. Let's go.

98
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,460
Yoda! There's a monster!

99
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,560
What in the world—

100
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,100
Stop, Ryota!

101
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,520
You can't defeat a guts slime alone!

102
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,600
What do you mean?

103
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,570
Guts slimes become invincible
when near death,

104
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,280
and they no longer take damage from
the last person to attack them.

105
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,410
So we need someone to weaken it
and someone to finish it off?

106
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,240
Yes!

107
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,910
Wow! You beat it!

108
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,500
Solo-proof floors.
Not very common.

109
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,130
You can leave this floor to us.

110
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,590
Ryota is the best one to finish them off.

111
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,810
Finish it off!

112
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,850
We did it!

113
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,690
Yeah. They're not that strong
if we all fight them together.

114
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,070
Onions...

115
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,280
Do you like onions, Eve?

116
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,110
All I need are carrots.

117
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,910
In that case,
I'll make curry tonight.

118
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,280
It'll have potatoes, onions,
and big chunks of carrot in it.

119
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,040
Big chunks of carrot!

120
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,540
Sounds good!

121
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,830
Celeste, do you like curry—

122
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,960
Watch out!

123
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,710
Yoda!

124
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,420
Carrot!

125
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,420
I'm fine. And call me something else!

126
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,760
It's not like the ones
we've been fighting.

127
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,720
It must be a rare monster!

128
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,930
Celeste, how do we defeat this one?

129
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,770
A high-guts slime.

130
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,350
It still needs someone to finish it off,

131
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,560
but when in its invincible
near-death state,

132
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,940
it reflects all attacks used
against it, so be careful.

133
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,650
We'll have to wear it down carefully.

134
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,200
Let me. I know its HP.

135
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,490
You do?

136
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:33,370
I killed one before.

137
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,289
About this much...

138
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,539
Ready now.

139
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:40,250
Right!

140
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,460
We got it!

141
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,340
This was a victory for teamwork!

142
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,680
That jewel is its drop.

143
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,270
When equipped,
it reflects some attacks.

144
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,690
Huh... That sounds pretty cool.

145
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:02,610
TELULU LEVEL 2

146
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,070
It does seem to be
reflecting attacks, but...

147
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,450
Carrot!

148
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,070
You defeated it just by standing there!

149
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,240
Hm... I suppose it is convenient, but...

150
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,210
It's faster to attack things myself.

151
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,870
Low-Level's carrots are the best!

152
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:26,250
I'll just stick with the plan
and sell this to Erza.

153
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,810
This is the rare drop from Telulu level 7,

154
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:37,260
the Slime Tear!

155
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,060
Level 7?

156
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,850
Yeah, you know, the guts thing.

157
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,730
Oh...

158
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,100
You'll buy it off me, right?

159
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,940
Yes! Thank you very much!

160
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,650
Thanks to you, my shop's rank
and trust level will go up again!

161
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,450
I'm glad I could be of use.

162
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,370
And here's the 3,000,000
pilos this item is worth.

163
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,580
That much?!

164
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,920
The price is up right now because
it's almost harvest festival time.

165
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,800
Excuse me!
Please let me join your party!

166
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,060
Please let me...

167
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,310
What, a little kid?

168
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:32,650
NIHONIUM LEVEL 5

169
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:45,920
It's fast! The red skeleton
is three times as fast!

170
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,080
But...

171
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,130
I'm still faster.

172
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,140
Ryota's max MP increased by one.

173
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,600
Oh, so floor 5's drops raise
your MP, or magic points.

174
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,350
Wait, MP is the energy needed
to use magic, right?

175
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,770
How do you even learn magic, anyway?

176
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,700
Exactly 3,000,000 pilos...

177
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,240
I can't believe I bought it.

178
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,080
Yes, most people learn
magic by leveling up,

179
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,120
but you can't level up.

180
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,040
But if you eat this magic fruit,

181
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,210
you can learn a random magic spell.

182
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,590
I had no idea things like this existed...

183
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,550
Eat it now and see what happens!

184
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,130
No, hang on.

185
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,010
There's a reason I went
outside of town for this.

186
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,350
The odds of this working are fifty-fifty,

187
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,980
but I want to try it.

188
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,280
I see. You let it become a stray,
so it will drop something even better.

189
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,330
Ryota?!

190
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:03,620
That must be a Metal Ryota!

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,800
It's tough! And fast! And strong!

192
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:20,220
I guess it's a monster that takes on
80% of the specs of whatever it copies.

193
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,430
Not a monster suited
for big gatherings...

194
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,570
It's still just a magic fruit.

195
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,650
No, it's actually not.

196
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,070
Could this mean...

197
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,990
I think... No, I'm sure of it!

198
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,370
Yoda, you've learned magic?!

199
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,120
And two spells?!

200
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah. One is Wind Cutter.

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,800
It's a level 1 wind elemental spell.

202
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,630
That's amazing!
What's the other spell like?

203
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,760
I want to know, too!

204
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,220
It's kind of weird, though.

205
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,560
I'll test it out on those guys.

206
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Okay, do what we always do.

207
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,600
Got it!

208
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,940
Leave it to me! Inferno!

209
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,800
Reservation!

210
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,510
I don't think so!

211
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,540
Wow! It's like I'm Yoda!

212
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,130
You mean that spell was...

213
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,170
Yeah. If it's used in advance
on a monster,

214
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,670
my drop rates apply
to whoever actually defeats it.

215
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,090
So it gives someone drop rates
equivalent to rank S?

216
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:45,430
Yeah, but it's not that useful.

217
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,020
It has to be cast on a monster,
so it only works if I'm there.

218
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,100
That's not true! I'm grateful for it!

219
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,020
Grateful for what?

220
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,230
I think I leveled up after that battle!

221
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,460
Oh, right!

222
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,820
When he uses that spell,

223
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,530
someone other than him
can finish off the monster!

224
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:06,950
So it helps others level up!

225
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,700
I'm so glad I got a spell
that'll help my friends!

226
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,540
Let's share the experience from now on,

227
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,040
so everyone can level up together!

228
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,420
Absolutely!

229
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,130
Yes!

230
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,930
Maybe I'll head to Nihonium today...

231
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:24,470
Huh?

232
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,890
That's...

233
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,930
Erza!

234
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,680
Oh, Ryota!

235
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,230
That's a lot of stuff you're carrying.
Let me help.

236
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,310
Thank you. I bought too much
and made things hard for myself.

237
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,240
Thank you for helping!

238
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,030
Well, I'll be on my way, then.

239
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,820
You'll actually let me join?!

240
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,580
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Now, run straight in! Got it?!

241
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,490
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Yes, sir!

242
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,000
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Too close! And we're too close to floor 7!

243
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,250
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
It wasn't supposed to be like this...

244
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,210
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Carrot?

245
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,000
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Hey, wait!

246
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,340
Really?! You'll really let me join you?!

247
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,970
Yes. You have potential.

248
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:06,260
Potential that can only shine
in a dungeon!

249
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,760
That guy...

250
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,560
Oh, that girl!

251
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,600
She's been asking around for
adventurer companions lately.

252
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,810
Her max level is only 2,
so everyone's turned her down, though.

253
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,690
Come with me! Let's chase
our dreams in the dungeons—

254
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:21,730
Hold it.

255
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,490
What do you want?

256
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,650
I want this girl in my party.

257
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,820
Me?! Wh-What?!

258
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,740
I won't let her go.

259
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,490
Not to you!

260
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,500
Wow! You're really going
to join Ryota's party?

261
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,780
Congratulations!

262
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,960
What an honor to be invited
into the Ryota Family,

263
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,380
the hottest party in town right now!

264
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,930
You're such a lucky girl!

265
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:49,430
A l-lucky girl? Me?

266
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,260
Yes! I mean, it's the Ryota Family!

267
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,100
That's the Ryota Sato guy
everyone's talking about?

268
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,520
The guy from Selen?

269
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,810
I-Is he that big a deal?

270
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,190
Yeah! He's been drawing
everyone's attention!

271
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,740
Thanks, Erza.

272
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,870
N-Not at all.

273
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,120
Just to make this official...
Do you want to join my party?

274
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,450
I do!

275
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,000
What's your name?

276
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,250
It's Alice.

277
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,540
Cool. Mine's Sato Ryota.
Glad to have you.

278
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,380
Thanks!

279
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,220
All right, first...

280
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,180
Try touching this.

281
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,220
Okay.

282
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,680
"ALICE"
LEVEL, STATUS

283
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,100
Oh, boy... Frankly, the only word
to describe this is "hopeless."

284
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,770
But considering
my own past experiences,

285
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:45,400
she should be able to
fight in this dungeon.

286
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,530
What's wrong?

287
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,820
Nothing. You should start
with some leveling up.

288
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,160
Let's go in.

289
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,330
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1

290
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,700
What is it?

291
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,000
The air in here really takes me back!

292
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,290
It does?

293
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:02,830
Yeah! I was born in a dungeon, apparently!

294
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,920
Maybe that's why!

295
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,460
Huh?

296
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:07,140
My mom said that
when she was pregnant with me,

297
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,839
I just popped out while
she was working in a dungeon!

298
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,180
Just popped out?!

299
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,300
Th-That can actually happen?

300
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,810
Anyway, let's go kill some monsters.

301
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,099
So, this way, then!

302
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:21,650
Huh?

303
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,440
Well, there are lots of
monsters this way, right?

304
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:30,030
Wow! Look at them all!

305
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:33,490
That's pretty amazing.
You can tell where monsters are?

306
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,290
Try killing these guys.

307
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:41,420
I'd say they should get you
to level 2, probably.

308
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,290
Hit them using that rock there.

309
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,750
This one? Got it!

310
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,430
I did it!

311
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:53,010
Now do the same to the others.

312
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,180
Right!

313
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,730
Did you level up?

314
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,810
Let's step outside and check.

315
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,780
I see. So now she can't
gain any more levels.

316
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,780
Hey...

317
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,570
Can we go back inside?

318
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,120
Did you lose something?

319
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,700
No, it's not that.

320
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,290
When we were in there earlier,
Bonesy told me to hurry back.

321
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,080
"Bonesy"?

322
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,750
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1

323
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,170
That one! Catch it!

324
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,760
What are you gonna do?

325
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,550
It's telling me to defeat it.

326
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:40,390
What the?!

327
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,230
Yeah! It's nice to have you
with us, Bonesy!

328
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,150
This is... Bonesy?

329
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,320
Bonesy's gonna fight
with us from now on.

330
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,410
Huh?

331
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,240
TELULU LEVEL 1

332
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,660
Go! You can do it!

333
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,250
Good job, Bonesy!

334
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,090
Is that damage going to heal?

335
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,680
Yep. As soon as Bonesy changes back.

336
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,890
That's amazing.

337
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,100
Hey, guess what?

338
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,850
Bonesy is calling me "Big Sis."

339
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,270
Because you were both
born in a dungeon?

340
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,770
Oh, yeah!

341
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,770
What now?

342
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,150
Jiggly's calling me.

343
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,730
"Jiggly"?!

344
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,780
This is the one that's calling you?

345
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,490
Yeah. It's telling me to defeat it.

346
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,620
You can do it, Bonesy!
I'm rooting for you!

347
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,340
You can do that?!

348
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,930
Good job, Bonesy!

349
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,180
Yeah! It's nice to have
you with us, Jiggly!

350
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,020
Her naming sense...

351
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,890
Got another new little brother, huh?

352
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,190
No, no!

353
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,230
Bonesy is a girl, so Jiggly's
not "another" little brother.

354
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,900
You're a girl?!

355
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,430
Hey, Ryota...

356
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:22,700
Thank you! It's because of you
that I met Bonesy and Jiggly!

357
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,290
It's not like I did anything
in particular...

358
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,790
Still, thanks!

359
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,460
Bonesy and Jiggly are
saying thank you, too!

360
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,960
I'm back.

361
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,380
Hello!

362
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,500
Welcome back, Yoda.

363
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,320
Thanks, Emily.

364
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,180
Did you make that, Emily?

365
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,600
Yes. I made carrot Hamburg steaks today.

366
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,060
I want to eat your carrots all my life!

367
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,150
She just proposed to me.

368
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,360
Th-Th-Th-That's a big problem!

369
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,780
H-How cute!

370
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,200
This is Bonesy, and this is Jiggly.

371
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,990
How can they be so cute?!

372
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,790
Hey, can I snuggle them a little bit?

373
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,210
Oh, they're scared.

374
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,040
Aw...

375
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,340
So you like cute things, Celeste?

376
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,630
I-If you could just...
let me snuggle you a tiny bit...

377
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:24,390
Weirdo.

378
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,520
I'm Alice.
Nice to meet you all!

379
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,520
I'd like to bring her into our party.
Is that okay?

380
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,810
No objections!

381
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,070
You like carrots?

382
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,320
Sorry. I'm not a fan of them.

383
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,450
10,000 votes in favor.

384
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,410
You're sure?!

385
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,580
We'll never fight over carrots.

386
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,950
And you, Emily?

387
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,540
Of course, I wholeheartedly agree!

388
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:56,090
Alice, Bonesy, and Jiggly are
all part of the Ryota Family!

389
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,130
Yay! Isn't that great, Bonesy and Jiggly?

390
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,350
And that's how we gained another new ally.

391
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,310
It looks like our days are about
to get even more exciting.
