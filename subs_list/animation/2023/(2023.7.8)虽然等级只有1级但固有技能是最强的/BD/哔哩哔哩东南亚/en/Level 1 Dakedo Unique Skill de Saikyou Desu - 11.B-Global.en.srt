1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,860
I worked as a salaryman
for a toxic company,

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,820
until I reincarnated...

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,620
in a crazy world where everything is
dropped by monsters in dungeons.

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,540
In my new life, I'm level 1,
but I have a unique skill

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,130
that puts all of my drop rates at rank S.

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,250
And now it's finally time
for the harvest festival!

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,340
But while that's going on,
I get dragged into some major trouble!

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:45,280
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
EVEN AT LEVEL 1

9
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
TIME FOR THE HARVEST FESTIVAL

10
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,570
Good morning, Yoda.

11
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,160
Morning, Emily.

12
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,580
Hey, where's everyone else?

13
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,410
Celeste and Eve left for
the dungeon this morning.

14
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,920
Apparently, a massive amount of carrots
has shown up in Telulu.

15
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,010
That's gotta be wild...

16
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,300
That just leaves Alice,
and as I recall...

17
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,180
Since Bonesy is so scared of Celeste,

18
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,230
she's staying at her previous
house today, right?

19
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,640
That's right.

20
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,610
You didn't go to the dungeon with them?

21
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,480
No, since today is the harvest festival.

22
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,900
I'm going to meet up
with Alice around noon

23
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,950
and show her around
while we check out the festivities.

24
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,790
Oh, the harvest festival.
That's finally starting, huh?

25
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,080
Would you like to come along with us?

26
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,970
Yoda! Yoda! Look at all this!

27
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,560
There are so many stalls!

28
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,850
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

29
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,230
- And over there, and over here...
- Emily doesn't often get this

30
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,270
- And over there, and over here...
- excited over anything.

31
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,940
Since she used to live in a dungeon,
this festival stuff must be new to her.

32
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,740
Okay! Let's spend today...

33
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,280
enjoying the heck out of this festival!

34
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,240
Yes, let's!

35
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,000
How cute!

36
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,250
Which one do you like?

37
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,170
Well, um...

38
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,840
Maybe... this one?

39
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,260
I'll take this one.

40
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,550
You got it.
That'll be 3,000 pilos.

41
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,270
Y-Yoda! I wasn't trying to...

42
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,620
Please take it.

43
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,980
Thank you.

44
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,420
Hey, good thinking!

45
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,649
Now I can keep this bell
with me all the time!

46
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,710
Hey! Ryota! Emily!

47
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,420
Ah, there you are.

48
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,130
Guys, listen to this!

49
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,550
There's this weird stall over there!

50
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,130
A weird...

51
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,640
...stall?

52
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,740
EXPERIENCE FROM ALKYL
Low prices, low prices!

53
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,520
EXPERIENCE FROM ALKYL
Low prices on experience points!

54
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,140
This is a weird stall, all right.

55
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,190
Right?

56
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,190
Hey, bro!
How 'bout some experience points?

57
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,520
How does this work?

58
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,740
Well, have you ever been to
the dungeon called Alkyl?

59
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,200
No, I haven't.

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,870
There's a monster there called
a plated mouse, and it's amazing!

61
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,790
When you defeat one,
it gives you a ton of experience points!

62
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,870
Oh, kinda like the metal slimes?

63
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,170
If you leave one of these boxes out,

64
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:15,000
a plated mouse stray will show up.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,920
And when you defeat that,
you'll level up in a heartbeat!

66
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,340
So how 'bout it?

67
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,140
That sounds interesting.

68
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,260
Ryota and I can't raise our
levels any more, though.

69
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,480
But we could use it
to help Emily level up.

70
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,240
Okay! Here comes the plated mouse!

71
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,120
We'll start with a binding bullet!

72
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,920
Way to go! Finish it, Emily!

73
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,180
Not yet, before that...

74
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,840
Reservation!

75
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,800
Now, Emily!

76
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,470
Right!

77
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,440
Huh? I thought strays didn't drop items.

78
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
That's my Reservation spell.

79
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,610
When I use it, my drop rates
apply to the monster,

80
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,910
even if it was Emily who killed it.

81
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,450
So I level up,
and I even get an item.

82
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,950
That's great!

83
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,460
Is this...

84
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,590
Ryota obtained a strengthening bullet.

85
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,590
Strengthening, huh?
Let's test it out.

86
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,650
Huh?

87
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,860
Nothing's happening.

88
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,320
It's not... broken, is it?

89
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,070
Let me try a regular bullet.

90
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,280
How about this?

91
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,250
I was right!

92
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:20,420
The strengthening bullet strengthens
whatever bullet is loaded after it's shot!

93
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,710
That's amazing!

94
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,050
Yeah, this'll have lots of uses.

95
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,550
We'd better go buy more
from that stall!

96
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,840
- Yeah!
- Let's!

97
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:34,680
Well, we've got lots of
strengthening bullets now.

98
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,100
What next?

99
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,270
Do you think that was...

100
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,270
Let's hurry!

101
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,820
Right!

102
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,400
A stray got out of its cage!

103
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,240
Run!

104
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:47,990
Hurry!

105
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,410
Are you all right?

106
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:56,410
Y-Yes...

107
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:00,330
Everything's fine now.
I beat the monster.

108
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,590
Not yet, Ryota!

109
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,750
You haven't beaten it yet!

110
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,800
What?!

111
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,140
Come on, this way!

112
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,470
I'll finish it off!

113
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,150
It didn't work!

114
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,820
Something's weird about this thing.

115
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,950
If it grows bigger by
absorbing our attacks...

116
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,620
You seem to be having some trouble.

117
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,870
You're... Neptune!

118
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,130
Hi there, Sato.

119
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,500
Looks like you've made
that thing pretty big.

120
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,720
Yeah. We'll need to be smart about
attacking it, or people could die.

121
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,470
What are you gonna do?
Turn tail and run?

122
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,270
Don't be stupid!

123
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:01,730
Help me out, Neptune!
We've gotta protect our town!

124
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,820
Lil! Ran!

125
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,150
Understood.

126
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,360
We'll do our best for you, Nep!

127
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,950
- God Bless!
- Devil Curse!

128
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,120
Allow us to show you...

129
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,340
the power of the Neptune Family!

130
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,550
Okay! We'll all attack it at once!

131
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,510
Neptune! Emily!

132
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,390
Right!

133
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,760
Ready when you are!

134
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,060
Take this!

135
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,400
Be still!

136
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,480
Purgatorium Gravity!

137
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,620
Thank you so much!

138
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,330
My daughter and I got separated
in the festival crowds.

139
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,920
Try not to get lost again, okay?

140
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,130
Okay.

141
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,050
You need to thank them.

142
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,050
Thank you, mister.

143
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm just glad you're safe.

144
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,560
When I grow up, I'm gonna
be an adventurer like you!

145
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:27,860
Oh, yeah? In that case,
I hope you'll remember this.

146
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,530
Remember what?

147
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,570
Hard work will always be rewarded.

148
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,530
I got that from
a very dear friend of mine.

149
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,980
If you're gonna try
to be an adventurer, too,

150
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,870
let's work hard together.

151
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,250
Yeah!

152
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,840
Ryota!

153
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:53,130
Celeste? Weren't you in the dungeon?

154
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,930
I was just making a brief stop back here,

155
00:10:55,930 --> 00:11:00,140
and I heard you were all
here fighting a monster.

156
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,060
The magic cart's full of carrots!

157
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,940
So you both came to help us?

158
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,270
It looks like you're already done, though.

159
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:11,980
Yeah, the Neptune Group helped us out.

160
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,570
Defeating monsters is part of our job.

161
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,160
Anyway, I see you've
started a family, too.

162
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,160
Yeah. They're all important
members of the team.

163
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,290
Hey, Sato...

164
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,580
Don't you want to ditch this "family"

165
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,420
and finally come over to my group?

166
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,760
Ask me that all you want,
but my answer's still no.

167
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,970
What a shame.
Shot down again.

168
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,510
But I got to fight alongside you,
so I'll be content with that for today.

169
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,730
See you later, Sato.

170
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,650
Well, in any case,
I'm glad everyone's safe.

171
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:55,530
Next time one shows up, I'll beat it!

172
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,740
GURGLE

173
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,570
Running in a panic like that
made me hungry.

174
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,490
Yes, and we've been
in the dungeon all day, too.

175
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:07,250
Well, then, since we're here,
let's get food from the stalls around here.

176
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,420
Yeah!

177
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,330
Let's enjoy the festival to its fullest!

178
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,540
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
This is pretty heavy, y'know...

179
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,980
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Keep it up, Nep!

180
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,050
- C'mon, Nep, tough it out!
- Help me out here...

181
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,050
Oh, I'm gonna do something.

182
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,680
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

183
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,050
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
See? There.

184
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,720
Yoda, look at that! It looks like fun!

185
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,180
Oh, cool!

186
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,190
Low-Level, you suck at ring toss.

187
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,070
Harsh!

188
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,400
Bonesy, Jiggly, open wide.

189
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,780
They look adorable when eating, too!

190
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,120
Eve is...

191
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,500
...eating something that isn't carrots!

192
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,540
Rabbits are actually pretty
okay with meat, too!

193
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:54,420
You did tell us a story
about that before.

194
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,720
I saw a stall over there selling
food made with carrots.

195
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,510
I'm a gourmand.
I only eat delicious carrots.

196
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:06,390
Maybe you should eat a variety
of foods and not be picky?

197
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,690
A low-level shouldn't be so impudent!

198
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,690
Ow!

199
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,020
You two get along so well.

200
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,440
I honestly don't get her...

201
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,280
Hey, Ryota...

202
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,580
It looks like there are
a bunch of monsters over there.

203
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,580
What? Did more strays show up?

204
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,750
If they're in that direction,
it's probably the arena.

205
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,590
Arena? They have one of those?

206
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,260
Yeah. Goods gathered
for the harvest festival

207
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,630
are turned into strays
in the arena and then killed.

208
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,050
Really? That's weird.

209
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,060
Fighters participate in pairs.

210
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:52,690
If you manage to defeat them,
you can get a rare item as a prize.

211
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:56,190
A rare item!
I wanna try for one!

212
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,110
Why don't we join, then?

213
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,400
Who will be on your team?

214
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,450
Assuming you participate,
you'll need one more with you.

215
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,410
Celeste, can I ask you?

216
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,250
What?! Me?!

217
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,880
Are you that surprised?

218
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,710
I thought you would be
the best choice for this.

219
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:24,640
I-Is that... like... a confession?

220
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,060
You're always out there
getting intel for me,

221
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,930
and you know a lot about monsters.

222
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:33,100
So you're the best bet
for something like this!

223
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,400
What's wrong?

224
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,570
That makes me happy, but it feels
like you don't see me as one of you.

225
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,490
Is there some kind of problem?

226
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,710
No problem at all!

227
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,800
Die! Inferno!

228
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:15,020
C-Celeste? You seem to be
going harder than usual...

229
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,770
You're imagining things!

230
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,820
Anyway,
that thing's still alive, you know!

231
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,480
I know!

232
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,870
It takes two to defeat a high guts slime.

233
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:35,830
You've mastered the art of leaving
them with just enough HP.

234
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,460
You rock, Celeste!

235
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,750
Ryota...

236
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,130
I'm going to work even harder.

237
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,260
I want to be as important
a teammate to you as Emily is.

238
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,390
You already are, Celeste.
You know that.

239
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,510
Ryota, you jerk!

240
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,600
You're gonna make me happy,
saying things like that!

241
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,940
The harvest festival sure was fun.

242
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,480
It was amazing!

243
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,990
Hey, Celeste, what was the rare item
we got at the arena?

244
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,450
It's in here.

245
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,410
It's a... let's see...

246
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:13,450
What in the world is this?

247
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,270
FUN FIREWORKS SET

248
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,370
It looks like it has lots of
the same thing inside it.

249
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,380
I've never seen that before.

250
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,040
Those are fireworks.

251
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,890
Wow! This is amazing, Yoda!
Just amazing!

252
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,810
I never thought I'd get to play
with fireworks in this world.

253
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:36,060
Long live rare items!

254
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,400
Not bad.

255
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,390
They're so pretty.

256
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,070
That was fun!

257
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,240
Right? I hadn't played with fireworks
since I was a kid.

258
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,160
I'm glad I got to do this
with all of you.

259
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,370
This was my first time doing
anything like a festival,

260
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,210
so I'm just really happy...

261
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,540
Alice?

262
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,260
They're calling...

263
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,839
Hey! Alice?!

264
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,880
A new little one?

265
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,140
Alice! Are you okay?

266
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Ryota...

267
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,849
Yeah, I'm okay.

268
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,109
Alice! Did something happen?

269
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,240
I had a feeling
someone was calling for me.

270
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,650
Which direction did it come from?

271
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,860
That way.

272
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,160
That's where Nihonium is.

273
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,500
Is there another monster in there
that you can befriend?

274
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,210
Maybe? I'm not really sure.

275
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,290
I want you to befriend a monster
that gives infinite carrots!

276
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,380
Or you could just
get a carrot as a friend!

277
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,680
I'd feel bad for a carrot friend
that you're just going to eat.

278
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,850
We can go check it out tomorrow.
It's late now.

279
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,850
You should stay with us tonight, Alice.

280
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,310
Can I?

281
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:01,980
Can she?!

282
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:08,230
Celeste, try not to scare
Bonesy and Jiggly too much.

283
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,150
I'll be careful...

284
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,080
Ah, I'm glad you came, Sato.

285
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,540
I heard you wanted to talk to me.

286
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,250
What's going on?

287
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,880
Come, have a seat.
I'll put some coffee on.

288
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,170
How many dozens of sugar cubes
would you like?

289
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,340
Just one cube is fine.

290
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,510
Ever the conservative type, aren't you?

291
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:42,180
The thing is, nothing's been dropping
in the dungeons since last night.

292
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,350
Huh?

293
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:49,150
Telulu, Silicon, Arsenic,
Bismuth, Polon, and Selen.

294
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:55,110
All six of Secro's dungeons
have ceased to produce drops.

295
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,320
A-All of them?!

296
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,790
This has never happened before.

297
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,700
As ashamed as I am to admit it,

298
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,250
I don't even know
how long this will last.

299
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,420
Please, Sato!

300
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,470
Would you investigate
what's going on here?

301
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,430
Investigate how?

302
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,890
I realize I'm asking too much of you,

303
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,770
but you're the only one I can rely on!

304
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:26,350
You're the one who got all
those rare drops from Selen!

305
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:26,980
Right?

306
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:33,280
All right. I can't just ignore this.

307
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,610
I'll do what I...

308
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:38,280
No, I'll do everything in my power
to find out why this is happening.

309
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,830
TELULU LEVEL 2

310
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:47,830
It's no use.
No items are dropping.

311
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,750
Just like on the other floors.

312
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,710
The carrots have died.

313
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,670
Carrot is dead.

314
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,970
Why isn't anything dropping, damn it?!

315
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,640
I can't pay off my mortgage
if I can't earn money here!

316
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,560
Yeah, but what are we
supposed to do about it?

317
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,810
I've got debt, too, y'know!

318
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,360
Oh, boy... What do I tell
my family waiting at home?

319
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,230
Damn it!

320
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,530
There might be something
dropping something somewhere.

321
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,700
Let's search every nook and cranny!

322
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,820
This looks bad.

323
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,330
Prices are already rising,
and people are buying up all they can.

324
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,960
It'll be terrible
if we can't buy vegetables.

325
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:29,960
Low-level! Make a carrot come out!

326
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,130
That's easy for you to say...

327
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,250
Hurry up!

328
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,880
I'm telling you,
it's not gonna happen.

329
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,890
Huh?!

330
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,970
Yay! Resurrected carrot!

331
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:50,440
But how? Nothing is
dropping for anyone else.

332
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,480
Is it just me?

333
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,940
I had a feeling
someone was calling for me.

334
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:02,240
It's apparently a useless dungeon
where nothing drops at all.

335
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,580
Nothing drops at all?

336
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,910
That's it!

337
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,750
Yoda?

338
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,210
I'll be right back!

339
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,960
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1

340
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,180
If all the dungeons
are like Nihonium now...

341
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,970
and if I'm right about the presence
Alice was picking up on...

342
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,980
NIHONIUM LEVEL 4

343
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,990
I found you!

344
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,820
You're the reason nothing's dropping
in the dungeons, aren't you?!

345
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,080
You're Nihonium's dungeon master!

346
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,830
What?!

347
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,840
Don't tell me...

348
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,890
None of my attacks work on it?!
