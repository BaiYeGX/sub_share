1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,610
I worked as a salaryman
for a toxic company,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,400
until I reincarnated...

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:12,120
in a crazy world where everything is
dropped by monsters in dungeons.

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,500
In my new life, I'm level 1,
but I have a unique skill

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,000
that puts all of my drop rates at rank S.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,920
And at last, I'm back in Secro!

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,630
Wait, there's a stray showing up already?!

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,840
And Eve, too?!

9
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:45,280
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
EVEN AT LEVEL 1

10
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING!
IT'S EVE'S TURN TO SHINE

11
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,860
No.

12
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,530
Not delicious.

13
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:18,280
I want those! I want to eat...

14
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,540
...the low-level's carrots!

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,670
Come back soon, Low-Level...

16
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,090
- Welcome! Come on over!
- Yo, check it out!

17
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,840
Oh, man! She's gorgeous!

18
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,140
This is Secro.
Pretty lively town, isn't it?

19
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:38,930
It is.

20
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,770
Come to think of it,
I wonder what Eve's up to.

21
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,190
Oh? Is that you, Ryota?

22
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,480
Erza! It's been so long!

23
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,030
Yes! So you're back now?

24
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,610
Wait...

25
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,450
Um... who is this?

26
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,780
Oh, I'll introduce you.

27
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,490
This is Celeste.

28
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,080
We're going to form a party
called the Ryota Family.

29
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,330
You're forming a party
with someone this beautiful?!

30
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,380
Erza? What's wrong?

31
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,420
N-Not a thing!

32
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,050
I heard rumors about all
the great things you've done!

33
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,470
I'm thrilled that one of my regulars
has become famous!

34
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,640
A-Anyway, I wanted to ask you a favor
regarding the harvest festival!

35
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,560
Please come by my shop
whenever you have time!

36
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,230
W-Well, bye!

37
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,980
Harvest festival?

38
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,230
I don't know much about it, either.

39
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,780
In that case, you can leave it all to me.

40
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:40,620
Emily and I went out and got some
information about the harvest festival.

41
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,790
Way to go, Celeste!

42
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,290
It's a festival held annually in Secro.

43
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:51,960
Goods found in Secro's dungeons are
gathered up and put on display.

44
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,130
Huh...

45
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,760
And what do they do with all those goods?

46
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,380
Kill them!

47
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,220
Eh?

48
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:01,680
They turn them into strays
in an arena and kill them.

49
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:06,520
The point is to show off both
the goods and the monsters.

50
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,600
I see.

51
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,520
So... what are we doing here, anyway?

52
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,820
Oh, actually...

53
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,820
NIHONIUM LEVEL 3

54
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,570
NIHONIUM LEVEL 3
After I parted ways with you two,

55
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:21,370
NIHONIUM LEVEL 3
I wanted to get my speed up

56
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,120
NIHONIUM LEVEL 3
to rank S in a hurry, so I came here...

57
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,910
Ryota's speed increased by 0.

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,040
But I maxed it out in no time.

59
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,790
NIHONIUM LEVEL 4

60
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,000
NIHONIUM LEVEL 4
I still had time,

61
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,750
so I went down to level 4.

62
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,420
I had some trouble at first,

63
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,340
but I finally managed to defeat
the monsters there...

64
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,140
Ryota's vitality increased by 1.

65
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:46,430
I put the seeds I found there in that box.

66
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,020
What?

67
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,060
Isn't that a bad idea?

68
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,270
- Okay!
- Strays?!

69
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,480
Huh?!

70
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,820
Celeste, everything's fine.

71
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,280
Ryota obtained binding bullets.

72
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,950
Binding bullets!

73
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:09,000
That sounds like a fun one!

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,000
And there you have it.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,420
I had no idea strays could drop things.

76
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,800
I haven't told anyone else about this.

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,050
So I'd like you to keep it quiet, too.

78
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,340
Huh? If you're keeping it secret,
why tell me?

79
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,680
Because you're one of us now.

80
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,980
What was that?

81
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,770
What the...

82
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,570
What happened here?!

83
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,570
A rare drop turned into a stray!

84
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,530
You guys need to run, too!

85
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,420
Emily! Celeste!

86
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,380
- Got it!
- Right!

87
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,720
Burn! Inferno!

88
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,650
Emily!

89
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,610
It's... not even moving...

90
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,660
That's it!

91
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,460
Looks like you get to show your
stuff already, Binding Bullets!

92
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,640
Time to finish this!

93
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,030
Emily! Are you okay?

94
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,830
Yes...

95
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,710
I'm all right... but...

96
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,800
All right! Let's buy you
a new hammer!

97
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
The best one out there!

98
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,470
What?! But that would be
wasted on me!

99
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,850
If I just straighten it
out like this, I can...

100
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,980
Emily...

101
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,270
We'll go buy a new one tomorrow.

102
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,440
Okay...

103
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,650
Is that true?!

104
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,160
Yeah... It was Sato
who defeated the stray.

105
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,620
Oh...

106
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,660
Hi, there!

107
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,880
I'm Smith, the weapons dealer.

108
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,500
Um... What did you want with us?

109
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:08,090
Well, I heard that Emily's hammer broke

110
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:11,430
when your party was fighting
the stray yesterday.

111
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,560
So I was hoping to offer you
a new hammer.

112
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,600
Offer one?

113
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,350
Yes!

114
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,520
The Ryota Family has drawn much
attention for their exploits in Selen,

115
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,990
and we supplied Emily, one of the members,
with her beloved hammer!

116
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,740
I want to lay claim to that slogan!

117
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,659
What?! I don't think I want that!

118
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,990
I promise you won't suffer for it.

119
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,080
I'll provide you with
the hammer at no charge.

120
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,210
Huh?

121
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,500
For... free?

122
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,170
Yes, for free!

123
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:48,590
Then I can't wait to do
business with you!

124
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,720
Thank you very much!

125
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,640
Now, let's get right
to the production process.

126
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,720
If you have any requests at all,
just let me know.

127
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,020
I-I can ask for anything?!

128
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,940
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1
Oh! Mr. Sato!

129
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,360
Hey, long time no see.
Working on air boxes again?

130
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,280
Is something wrong?

131
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,200
The thing is... air boxes haven't
been selling so well lately.

132
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,920
It's not as though Princess Margaret
is any less popular...

133
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:24,460
I guess people are tired of air boxes?

134
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,340
Can't you just sell
something else, then?

135
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,260
Something else? Such as?

136
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,470
Well...

137
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,770
The princess's panties, maybe?

138
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,020
Shall I lift it a bit more?

139
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,060
That's it!

140
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,190
What?! You know you
can't actually do that!

141
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:50,030
Rings?

142
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,410
- Rings would be right in line
- Please accept this.

143
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,950
- with the princess's elegant image,
- It's the princess's... my own...

144
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,240
- and they would feel special.
- It's the princess's... my own...

145
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,290
Are you a genius?!

146
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,540
Princess!

147
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,340
I've got this!

148
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,180
Excuse me!

149
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,890
Thank you for saving me
when I was in danger.

150
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,040
Aw, c'mon.

151
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,310
I just did
what anyone would've done.

152
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,070
Mr. Sato, thank you for saving our princess.

153
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,240
To thank you, since you
gave us the idea of rings,

154
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:37,620
would you allow us to present you
with the first one?

155
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,330
The first one?
But I couldn't...

156
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,960
Please!

157
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,980
I want to give my first...
to you, Mr. Sato.

158
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,300
Huh? Uh...

159
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,130
Okay...

160
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,760
What do you think, Miss Emily?

161
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,510
Well, let's see...

162
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,600
I think I'd like it heavier and sturdier.

163
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,900
Eve! Welcome!

164
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,900
Carrots—I mean,
where is the low-level?

165
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,190
Low-level?

166
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,320
If you mean Yoda,
he's gone to Nihonium.

167
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:21,370
He was going to stop by Telulu
and then Erza's shop after that.

168
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:23,250
Nihonium first!

169
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,500
Got it!

170
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:30,090
TELULU LEVEL 1

171
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,930
This thing sure came in handy right away.

172
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,390
Ryota obtained a pouch that automatically
picks up and contains dropped items.

173
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,140
If I didn't have this, people would've
seen me getting these seeds.

174
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:48,730
That would've been bad.

175
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,650
Anyway, time to make a little money!

176
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,190
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1
Carrots...

177
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,360
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1
Low-Level... Carrots...

178
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,150
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1

179
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,570
He's not here!

180
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,910
Then... Telulu!

181
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,830
U-Um...

182
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,290
Eve?

183
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,630
Low-Level...

184
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,130
...where are you?

185
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,090
Here you go.

186
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:21,010
All right, got it.

187
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,470
Oh! Ryota, you're here!

188
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,560
Yeah.

189
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,150
So, what was the favor you wanted
to ask me for the harvest festival?

190
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,190
Right!

191
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,650
Wait, do you know
what the harvest festival actually is?

192
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,070
Pretty much.

193
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:40,530
You put products
from dungeons on display,

194
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,530
then turn them into strays
and kill them, right?

195
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,450
If you know that much,
it'll save us some time.

196
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,460
I'd like you to collect drops
that are difficult to get.

197
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,880
I see. You mean rare drops, right?

198
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,960
Yes!

199
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,090
And I'll pay you for all of them.
Would you do that?

200
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,470
Of course I will.

201
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,010
You're always doing so much
for me, after all.

202
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,930
Thank you so much!

203
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,890
In that case, take this.

204
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,020
It's a list of the rare drops
we haven't found yet.

205
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,110
So sorry to interrupt your fun.

206
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,570
What fun?!

207
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,860
Here's the 40,000 pilos
for the items you brought in.

208
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,950
Huh? That's more small
change than usual.

209
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,950
Oh, sorry about that.

210
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,870
The person in charge of the dungeon
that drops money was arrested for corruption.

211
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,460
So money circulation
is lagging a bit at the moment.

212
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,920
Huh...

213
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,510
Wait, money is dropped
in a dungeon?!

214
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,470
Y-Yes, that's right.

215
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,470
Which means...

216
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:53,520
I should get a stray from this!

217
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,150
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Hey, director! Punch!

218
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,320
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

219
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,910
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Why am I doing the title call alone?

220
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:05,030
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
It's not even my turn.

221
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,290
It worked!

222
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,960
Hey! Don't run away from me, 10,000 pilos!

223
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,560
Got it!

224
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,940
What's this?

225
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:40,480
Ryota obtained a potion that boosts one's plant
drop rate by three ranks for ten minutes.

226
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,740
Ooh!

227
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,660
Actually, this doesn't mean much to me,
since my drop rates are all at rank S...

228
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:51,910
I found you!

229
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:56,210
Low-Level!

230
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,710
Carrots, please!

231
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,590
Flop.

232
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,800
Huh?

233
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,850
TELULU LEVEL 2

234
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:14,100
If you want carrots that badly,
ask your partymates.

235
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,520
Not good enough!

236
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,940
Your carrots taste better!

237
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,190
Also, I left them.

238
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,150
What? Why?

239
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,320
A difference in dungeonal direction.

240
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,910
Were you a band?!

241
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,700
I'm a rabbit who just wants carrots,
and they want other stuff.

242
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,210
It happens all the time.

243
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,420
All the time? Really?

244
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,420
Rabbits are strong!

245
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,130
I'm fine by myself!

246
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,840
Rabbits know...

247
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,050
...that partymates are a hassle.

248
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,270
Not good.

249
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,890
MANGAN LEVEL 16

250
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,480
Come on, Eve!

251
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,270
Don't just eat meat.
Eat some vegetables, too.

252
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,150
No!

253
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,570
I hate vegetables! Yucky!

254
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,820
I like meat!

255
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,240
You need to eat them anyway!

256
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,740
No!

257
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:20,250
Party members are annoying.
I hate them.

258
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,680
Huh?

259
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,100
It talked! What an unusual carrot!

260
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,600
Is this... a haunted house?

261
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,020
Not a carrot.
You're a human?

262
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,190
Are you a ghost?

263
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,450
A cow ghost?!

264
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,540
No. It's a death buffalo.

265
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,660
It's this floor's monster.

266
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,960
Monster?!

267
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,380
Stay still!

268
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,480
Hmph!

269
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,940
Wow!

270
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,980
How did you do that?

271
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,819
Can I do it, too?

272
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,990
Huh?

273
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,570
I wanna exterminate ghosts, too!

274
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,530
Come on! Teach me how!

275
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,490
Please teach me!

276
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,410
O-Okay...

277
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,220
Now! Throw!

278
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,130
Right!

279
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,150
It turned into a carrot!

280
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,320
Throw it away.

281
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
Huh? Why?

282
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,740
I hate carrots. Yucky.

283
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,580
You shouldn't be picky about food.

284
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't care! I hate—

285
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:23,540
Rabbits—

286
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,830
Here. It's yummy.

287
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,850
Want this, too?
You can have it.

288
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,430
Here.

289
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,480
You're good person!
We're a party!

290
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,310
Yeah! We're a party!

291
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,900
Huh?

292
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,200
Where have you been?!

293
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,870
We were so worried!

294
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:06,580
Hey, listen to this!
I defeated a big cow!

295
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,920
And then...

296
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:17,550
From then on, I was a carrot-loving rabbit
who sought out delicious carrots.

297
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,600
All because of that boy...
my partymate.

298
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,930
Which means parties are bad.

299
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,480
I think you're just being
a bit too extreme.

300
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:32,250
Anyway, if you love carrots that much,
you should get your own.

301
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,780
I can't.
My plant drop rate is D.

302
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,740
I only get yucky carrots.

303
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,030
Oh...

304
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,830
Hey, I've got just the thing
for you, then.

305
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,330
You do?

306
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,210
It's not a carrot.

307
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:51,630
Don't worry about that.
Just drink it.

308
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,720
Is this real?!

309
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,140
Yeah. If your plant drop rate is D,

310
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,770
it should've just gone up
by three to A.

311
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,230
Give it a try.

312
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,330
Now taste it.

313
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,500
The sweetness!
The crunch!

314
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,210
It's definitely an A-rank carrot!

315
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,340
Plus, the sense of accomplishment
in knowing I got it myself!

316
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,640
This is... truly delicious!

317
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,640
Where do they
sell this potion?!

318
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,100
Uh... sorry.

319
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,230
Nobody sells it.

320
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,690
In fact... it's a special item
that only I can get.

321
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,990
Low-Level!

322
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,740
Huh?

323
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,450
Let me join your party!

324
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,410
What?! Just like that?!

325
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,710
You said partymates were bad!

326
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,830
I was wrong!

327
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:14,920
Partymates are good!

328
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,840
They give me potions,
and they give me tasty carrots!

329
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,300
Partymates didn't do that! I did!

330
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,470
Please! I'll do anything!

331
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,560
Please!

332
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,930
- Please! Please! Please!
- Okay, okay! You can join!

333
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,230
- Please! Please! Please!
- You can join my party!

334
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,690
Low-Level! I love you!

335
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:40,990
I'm back...

336
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,280
Yoda, look at this!

337
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:47,870
My new hammer is all...
done...?

338
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:51,870
Um... what has happened, exactly?

339
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,920
Well...

340
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,210
This is Eve, and she'll be
joining the Ryota Family.

341
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:02,740
Yay! Welcome to our party!

342
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,140
Low-Level!
I love you, love you, love you!
