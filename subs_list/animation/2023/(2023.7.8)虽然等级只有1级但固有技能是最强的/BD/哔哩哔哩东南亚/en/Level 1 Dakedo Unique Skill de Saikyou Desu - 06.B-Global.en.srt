1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,820
I worked as a salaryman
for a toxic company,

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,689
until I reincarnated...

3
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:09,860
in a crazy world where everything is
dropped by monsters in dungeons.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:15,080
In my new life, I'm level 1,
but I have a unique skill

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,210
that puts all of my drop rates at rank S.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,870
And today I'm...

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:23,000
dealing with another gorilla
while trying to get my license?!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,840
And then I meet a mysterious girl
who uses fire magic...

9
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,010
What the heck is about to happen?!

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:45,280
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
EVEN AT LEVEL 1

11
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
A BEAUTIFUL GIRL APPEARS

12
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,570
I got some new drops today: watermelons.
Could you appraise them?

13
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:15,450
Wow, that's a nice watermelon!

14
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,200
You've done it again, Ryota!

15
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,500
Give me just a minute while I head
to the back and prepare...

16
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,120
There'll be no need for that.

17
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,750
I'll assess your goods
right here and now.

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,540
Eric!

19
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,250
Let's see...

20
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,100
Its refreshing texture and sweet flavor
make my very soul feel fulfilled.

21
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,060
It's like I'm on the beach in midsummer,
with the sun blazing down on me!

22
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,480
What? Watermelons from the guy
who makes Ryota's Bamboo Shoots?

23
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,820
First bamboo shoots,
and now watermelons?!

24
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,360
I want a bite, too!

25
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,820
Hey! Stop it!
That's mine!

26
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,820
Ryota!

27
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,240
Please let us sell these Ryota's Watermelons
through an exclusive contract, too!

28
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,830
Sure...

29
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,380
Wow... The watermelon's just as popular
as the bamboo shoots!

30
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,590
All right! There's another
reliable source of income!

31
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,220
Oh, Ryota...

32
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,760
Watermelons are dropped on
level 5 of Telulu, right?

33
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,590
Yeah.

34
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,560
Have you gotten
your license already?

35
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,180
License?

36
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,100
Yes. It gives you permission to explore
dungeon levels lower than level 6.

37
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,520
It works for all dungeons
across the world.

38
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,770
Since dungeons get more
dangerous every five levels,

39
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,820
different towns have different policies.

40
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,530
Uh-huh.

41
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,450
SAFE: NO LICENSE NEEDED
In Secro,

42
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,530
SAFE: NO LICENSE NEEDED
there's a new license every five levels,

43
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,530
SAFE: NO LICENSE NEEDED
and traders aren't permitted to buy items

44
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,820
DANGEROUS: LICENSE 1, 2
and traders aren't permitted to buy items

45
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,990
DANGEROUS: LICENSE 1, 2
dropped in those levels

46
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,950
DANGEROUS: LICENSE 1, 2
if the adventurer doesn't have the license.

47
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,410
I see.

48
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:48,000
That would stop people from putting themselves
in danger to get more valuable drops.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,790
Right. So...

50
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,210
I recommend getting a license
to make things easier in the future.

51
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,550
So this is the place?

52
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,970
Excuse me.

53
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:06,480
Is this where I can get a license?

54
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,480
What are your achievements?

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,310
Huh?

56
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,030
When they ask about
your achievements...

57
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,320
Oh, uh...

58
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,360
I regularly bring back watermelons
from the fifth level of Telulu.

59
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,410
Hmph. Telulu, huh?

60
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,210
This way.

61
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,500
What's his problem?
Talk about a bad attitude.

62
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,090
This melon was dropped at
level 6 or lower in Telulu.

63
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,720
I'm going to turn it into a stray.

64
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,550
If you can defeat it, you pass.

65
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:48,350
Be ready. This won't be like what
you've seen on level 5 and up.

66
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,020
Just what I was hoping for.

67
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,480
Here it is!

68
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,910
That's a Steel Slime!

69
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,320
It's so hard that blades
are useless against it!

70
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,160
Still, instead of just seeing
how things go...

71
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll say hello with my rank S strength!

72
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,340
It really is as hard as steel.

73
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,920
Yoda...

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,840
No problem. I've got a plan
that should prove interesting.

75
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,970
All right! Bring it on,
Steel Slime!

76
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,060
A fire bullet!

77
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,400
But it doesn't seem to be working!

78
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,570
No, it just hasn't started yet!

79
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,820
A freezing bullet this time?

80
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,700
Emily, watch this.

81
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,530
See?

82
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,250
What?! How'd you do that?!

83
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:53,040
An extreme temperature difference.

84
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,130
Hitting it with a powerful fire bullet,

85
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,590
then immediately freezing it
with a freezing bullet,

86
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,170
weakens metal by making it brittle.

87
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,840
Wow...

88
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,470
Incredible...

89
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,010
You're really something, bro!

90
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,970
You have my approval
as an examiner!

91
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,310
Your Secro license for levels 6
and below is approved!

92
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,730
Congratulations!

93
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,730
So this is my license!

94
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,980
Congratulations, Yoda!

95
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,400
I've been working here
for over ten years,

96
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,320
and I've never been so impressed!

97
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,530
Secro's future is bright!

98
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,780
To make this the most effective...

99
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,490
To get those as drops...

100
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:29,740
Yoda?

101
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,910
Oh, right.
I have some preparations to make.

102
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:33,910
Emily!

103
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,710
I need your help!

104
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,170
There's something I want!

105
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,210
A FEW DAYS LATER

106
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,550
A FEW DAYS LATER
We finally made it here.

107
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,880
All right!

108
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,930
When you said you needed 1.5 million
pilos because you wanted a tuna,

109
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,600
you really threw me for a loop.

110
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,480
There's something I really want to try.

111
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,770
And the first step to doing that
is turning this into a stray.

112
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,440
Yes! There it goes!

113
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,360
The stray that comes from a tuna is...

114
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,780
the same kind of gorilla
that attacked Secro!

115
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:11,870
Don't worry!
Let me handle this!

116
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,790
First, a freezing bullet...

117
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,080
to immobilize it!

118
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:23,050
Sorry, pal! I gotta use
the gun I got from you...

119
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,880
to kill you!

120
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,430
Th-That was amazing, Yoda!

121
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,980
That first gorilla gave you so much trouble,
but you beat this one in no time!

122
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,270
Yes! Just like I thought!

123
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,400
Gorillas drop guns and regular bullets.

124
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,530
Now I can dual-wield!

125
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,030
This'll make special bullet
combos a lot easier!

126
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,280
Two guns at once...

127
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:57,080
Y-Yoda, please don't
end up turning evil!

128
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:58,920
Huh?

129
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,500
H-Hey, come on!
It'll be fine!

130
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,710
I'll always be peaceful
as long as you're around!

131
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,120
Did something happen?

132
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,890
Actually... a strike has been called.

133
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,730
Doesn't sound like things
have been peaceful here.

134
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:21,270
The Adalberd Group occupies
level 6 of Silicon,

135
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,610
the only place you can get rice,

136
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,070
and they're saying that if I don't
raise the price of Secro rice,

137
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:29,030
they won't sell me anymore.

138
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,530
I see.

139
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,830
I guess I should find whoever's
in charge and talk to them.

140
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,039
Hey, if it isn't Sato.

141
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,289
You're...

142
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,460
Neptune!

143
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,130
What're you doing here?

144
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,590
You must be here because
of Adalberd, too, right?

145
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,470
Yeah. You, too?

146
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,890
By request.

147
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,050
Request?

148
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,380
Adalberd's done this lots of times.

149
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,810
The people in town have
finally run out of patience.

150
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,190
So the Neptune Group
might just get rid of them?

151
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,820
No, not quite.

152
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,660
We won't get rid of them.
We'll destroy them.

153
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,450
I have a question.

154
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,410
What is it?

155
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:17,080
Would you let me handle this?

156
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,250
Let you... destroy them?

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,710
Get rid of them.

158
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,380
SILICON LEVEL 6

159
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,380
SILICON LEVEL 6
This is what's wrong with you!

160
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,260
You gotta really go in there and...

161
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,300
Halt! Who goes there?!

162
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,470
Entry to this level is forbidden!

163
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,350
You're gonna use force?!

164
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,060
Get out here, boys! The townies
are trying to muscle their way in!

165
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,040
Well, that worked out.

166
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,460
Hey, what's that?

167
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,130
Don't just pop up behind me!

168
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:10,300
This is a healing bullet.
All it does is heal wounds,

169
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,510
but when you fuse two together,
it becomes a sleep bullet,

170
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,430
and it puts your target to sleep.

171
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,470
Yep!

172
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,430
This is the new potential that came about
when I got a second gun!

173
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:24,020
ARSENIC LEVEL 1

174
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,770
What can you do with two guns?

175
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,360
I tested out all kinds of
different possibilities.

176
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,620
That was amazing!
What did you do?

177
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,700
I shot a freezing bullet
and a fire bullet at the same time.

178
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,750
Looks like that turns them
into an erasing bullet.

179
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,830
Erasing bullet!
That's so cool!

180
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,590
And the combination is just
a freezing bullet and a fire bullet?

181
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,130
What Emily said gave me a hint,

182
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:56,550
so I tried several different
bullet combinations.

183
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,470
The possibilities for bullet fusions
are basically endless.

184
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,390
Getting a second gun gave that to me.

185
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,730
Wow, so you're doubling
their healing power.

186
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,360
Exactly.

187
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,570
Well, guess we should
carry these guys outside.

188
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,070
Since you followed me down here,
you'd better help out.

189
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,200
Aw...

190
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,460
So that's the infamous Ryota Sato, is it?

191
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,580
We're just waiting together...

192
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,540
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

193
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,040
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Tee-hee.

194
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,710
I don't want to do any more eyecatches!

195
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,840
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
I don't want to do any more eyecatches!

196
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,050
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

197
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,590
Thank you for coming by.

198
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,550
I'm Clint Gray,
the dungeon chief of Secro.

199
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,260
Dungeon chief?

200
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,020
Doesn't ring a bell?

201
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,730
It means I hold a pretty high
position here in Secro.

202
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,770
Uh-huh...

203
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,560
Now, let's cut to the chase.

204
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,860
I'd like to ask a favor of you.

205
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,650
A favor?

206
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,110
Yes. I'd like to enlist your aid
in a battle for a new dungeon

207
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,530
against the neighboring city of Hetero.

208
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,740
A battle for a new dungeon?

209
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,960
All the dungeons east of Secro
have meat as drops.

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,420
And as you know,
Hetero is a livestock city.

211
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,710
I don't, actually...

212
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:17,010
A new dungeon was found halfway
between Hetero and Secro.

213
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,720
Remarkably, the drops in this dungeon
are half vegetables and half meat.

214
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,600
If vegetables made up more than half,
Secro could claim it, but...

215
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,900
Huh... So they decide ownership of
dungeons by the ratio of the drops?

216
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,650
But...

217
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,940
Is it absolutely necessary
to pick which city it'll belong to?

218
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:41,620
Every time dropped items are purchased,
a tax is charged!

219
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:45,660
Ownership of dungeons makes a huge
difference in a town's economic health!

220
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,580
S-Sorry...

221
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,130
No, I apologize for losing my composure.

222
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,920
Let me cool down for a moment.

223
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,550
Mm, sweet!

224
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,390
Sugar is the best!

225
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,560
Is he not afraid of diabetes at all?

226
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,480
Anyway, since vegetables and meat
are dropped in equal proportions,

227
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,860
we decided to determine their ownership
based on who gets more rare drops.

228
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,950
This is why, since you're renowned for
your strength and high drop rates,

229
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,070
I chose you to help.

230
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,990
I won't ask you to do it
for free, of course.

231
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:28,040
Even if we lose,
you'll get a monetary reward,

232
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,420
and if we win, all dropped items you receive
henceforth will be exempt from taxation.

233
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,710
What do you say?
Will you accept?

234
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,130
It makes me feel good to have my work
recognized and relied on like this.

235
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:43,300
I'll need my guns,

236
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,430
and I should have plenty
of special bullets ready.

237
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:49,520
That just leaves the magic cart,
a change of clothes...

238
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,310
Kinda feels like I'm getting
ready for a business trip.

239
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,980
Back then, I worked too hard

240
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,980
and pushed my own limits too far...

241
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,240
But now, I have Emily with me.

242
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,820
Emily?

243
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,240
Right!

244
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,200
That's the story.

245
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,410
So I'll be going to
this new dungeon, Selen.

246
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,120
That's amazing, Yoda!

247
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,090
Just like the Neptune Group!

248
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:19,630
Being asked to inspect
a dungeon is a big deal!

249
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,050
Oh, yeah. It was the same way
with Nihonium, wasn't it?

250
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,680
Understood!

251
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,140
I'll hold down the fort
while you're away!

252
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,560
No, I want you to come with me.

253
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,640
What? You do?

254
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,480
Yeah.

255
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,270
But I won't be of any use there.

256
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,480
That's not true!

257
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,320
I want you to come with me.

258
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,530
Low-Level! Carrots!

259
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,160
Eve?!

260
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,580
What will you do about carrots?!

261
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:54,410
Okay, okay! We'll get as many
as you need before we leave!

262
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,580
Heh! Better believe it!

263
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,630
There's nothing here.

264
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,510
The only things that don't become
strays are air, water, and earth.

265
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:08,470
Other than places with lots of people,
like towns and dungeons,

266
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,260
it's like this everywhere.

267
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,270
I see.

268
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,850
There's seriously nothing
here at all, though.

269
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,730
This world is so weird...

270
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,650
Emily? What are you doing?

271
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,360
Traveling from town to town is strenuous.

272
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,820
If anyone travels through here after us,

273
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:28,820
I hope this will bring them
a bit of cheer.

274
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,450
Round, round,
the sun is big and round...

275
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,630
Two of them together
make big, soft cushions!

276
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,050
Oh! There's a cane
sticking out of the sofa!

277
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,720
A cane is there to hold you up!

278
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,890
Here... and there...

279
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,060
Oh! We have to add
pupils to the eyes!

280
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,470
Ahem!

281
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,100
And now it's all done!

282
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,030
Wh-What is this?

283
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,360
It's Mr. Bean Sprout!

284
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,200
Bean sprouts are a source of energy!

285
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,240
I... I see.

286
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,620
Then, I'll draw something, too.

287
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,330
You're very good at drawing!

288
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,040
That's a cute bean sprout!

289
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,830
W-Well, yours is cute, too!

290
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:27,090
Now it's perfect!

291
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:29,550
Okay, ready to get moving again?

292
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:30,680
Yes!

293
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:36,930
YOU CAN DO IT!

294
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,850
Yoda! Hold up that side, please!

295
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:42,560
S-Sure.

296
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,900
And... hup!

297
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,860
There! All done!

298
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,200
That backpack had...

299
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,320
a tent this big in it?!

300
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,200
This is where I get
to show my real skills!

301
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,620
Could you go and fetch
some water, please?

302
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,540
Sure.

303
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,339
What the heck is going on in there?

304
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,680
Now that I'm used to living
in a house with Emily,

305
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,720
roughing it in the wilderness
like this is a big change.

306
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,390
I have up early to go find carrots, too.

307
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,310
Nice job, Low-Level.

308
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,599
I hope I got enough of them...

309
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,859
Yoda! It's all done!

310
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,780
Wh-Wh-What the heck is all this?!

311
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,200
A warm light illuminates the tent...

312
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,080
A relaxing sofa brimming
with a sense of security...

313
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,620
And the most amazing cooking
is sitting here as if it's a matter of course!

314
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,000
Even in a tent, Emily's house
has an overwhelming presence!

315
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,920
Wait, it doesn't make sense!

316
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,010
How in the world
did you carry all this?

317
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,000
Huh?

318
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,800
I packed it in my backpack.

319
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,340
It was pretty heavy.

320
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,180
What kind of backpack
does she have, exactly?

321
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,730
Oh! There's a dessert
for after dinner, too!

322
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,900
Since we're on our first trip together,

323
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,770
I was so happy,
I gave it extra effort.

324
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,980
So precious!

325
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,860
RYOTA ABANDONED ALL THOUGHT!
So precious!

326
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,190
RYOTA ABANDONED ALL THOUGHT!
Huh?

327
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,780
Oh, right. I'll go burn our trash.

328
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,580
Burn it? Not throw it out?

329
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,120
That's right.
I'm incinerating it.

330
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,330
In town, there are people
who do it for us,

331
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,290
but at times like these,
we have to do it ourselves.

332
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:28,750
We don't want things turning into strays.

333
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,920
Does even trash turn into strays?

334
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,340
And the strays that come
from trash are really strong.

335
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,930
They're different monsters
than they originally were.

336
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,510
Do different monsters
come from trash?

337
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:43,480
Burning trash is a very important job.

338
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,650
If I were to kill one of those strays...

339
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,270
Do you think something might happen?

340
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,990
The stray our trash turned into...

341
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,080
It's... a Frankenstein?!

342
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,160
I'll hold it here!

343
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,500
Emily, stand back!

344
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,160
Right!

345
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,620
We'll start with this one!

346
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:09,000
Burn it to ashes, fire bullet!

347
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,380
It didn't work!
The flames are too weak!

348
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,340
If one isn't enough, how about this?!

349
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,090
That's...

350
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,440
They always make such a loud sound.

351
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,730
These fused bullets really
are gonna be handy.

352
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,730
Yes! They're amazing!

353
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:33,570
Now...

354
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:53,130
Yoda, did that shot just... curve?

355
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,010
Yeah.

356
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,970
More like the bullet chased
the slime, actually.

357
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,970
It's a homing bullet!

358
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,350
Yoda's gained yet another
dangerous weapon...

359
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:10,560
So this is Selen, the new dungeon
halfway between Secro and Hetero!

360
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,610
It's so busy here.

361
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,360
Yeah, 'cause people have been
sent in from both towns.

362
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,080
Emily, isn't that...

363
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,620
A pile of trash, it looks like.

364
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,580
With so many people here,
there's bound to be lots of trash.

365
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,750
Is it okay to just leave it there?

366
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,130
It's probably fine since there
are so many people here,

367
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,090
but it's still scary, isn't it?
Like a ticking time bomb.

368
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,380
Burn.

369
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,890
Fire Magic: Inferno!

370
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,900
She must be in charge of gathering up
all the trash and burning it.

371
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,650
What incredible magic power.

372
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,660
Whoa...

373
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,870
The next trash pile
is already that big?

374
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,330
It's so much!

375
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,790
She can't burn enough to keep up
with this kind of trash production!

376
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,250
No! We have to stop her right now!

377
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:16,840
Huh?

378
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,800
Those bags under her eyes...
And she's so pale.

379
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,550
That's what people who've put in over
100 hours of overtime in a month look like!

380
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,770
Just like... when I...

381
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,720
Let's go!

382
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,850
Okay!

383
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,190
Are you all right?

384
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,820
Adventurers?

385
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,660
If you have trash,
just bring it all here, okay?

386
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:45,410
Sure, but... you should rest for a while!

387
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,790
Thank you, but I can't do that.

388
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:51,290
I have to burn the trash right away.

389
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,620
But...

390
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,830
I'm all right.

391
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,590
Fire Magic: Inferno!

392
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,560
Are you okay?!
