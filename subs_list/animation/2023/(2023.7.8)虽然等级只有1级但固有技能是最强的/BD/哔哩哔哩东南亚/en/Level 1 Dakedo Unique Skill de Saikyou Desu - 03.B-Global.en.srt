1
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:07,320
I worked as a salaryman
for a toxic company,

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,430
until I reincarnated...

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,710
in a crazy world where everything is
dropped by monsters in dungeons.

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,110
In my new life, I'm level 1,
but I have a unique skill

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,250
that puts all of my drop rates at rank S.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,030
And today I'm facing off against

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,390
a really scary monster and...

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:29,330
Emily?!

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:45,230
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

10
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
KILL ALL THE LITTLE BLACK THINGS

11
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,030
Yoda?!

12
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,410
Don't underestimate my skill!

13
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,840
It's over...

14
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,340
Yes, it is!

15
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,680
What a cheeky low-level.

16
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,300
- Thank you!
- That was amazing!

17
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,640
What a man!

18
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,100
You're the town hero!

19
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,500
I got a weapon that shouldn't
exist in this world

20
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,620
from a stray, a monster that's
not supposed to drop anything.

21
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,250
LUCK, DEXTERITY, SPEED, WILL,
INTELLIGENCE, VITALITY, STRENGTH, MP, HP

22
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,390
I'm still at level 1,

23
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,170
RYOTA: LEVEL, STATUS
but thanks to the seeds I find here,

24
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,750
my abilities are steadily improving.

25
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:14,550
NIHONIUM LEVEL 2

26
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,470
Okay...

27
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,600
Let's see if this thing's
gonna be of any use.

28
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,410
Yeah, it's definitely a gun.

29
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,560
It works on monsters
just the way it should.

30
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,390
I wonder how I'm supposed
to get more bullets.

31
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,480
Will they drop from strays, too?

32
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,910
I'll have to use them
sparingly until I know.

33
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,450
Yoda!

34
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:32,130
Your weapon is amazing, Yoda.

35
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,630
I've never seen anything like it.

36
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,420
Yeah, and my strength is
at rank B now because of it.

37
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,920
Let's check out the next level later.

38
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,090
Sure!

39
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,570
As my stats increase,
so does the range of places I can go.

40
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,880
It feels good knowing
there's something I can do!

41
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,060
She's not coming.

42
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,550
So she isn't.

43
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,240
Well, I guess Eve has stuff to do, too.

44
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,080
She can't just show up every day.

45
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,900
We'll save these carrots for her,
just in case.

46
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,890
Yeah. She might still
show up at the house.

47
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:16,660
Anyway, the lunches you make
are still the best, Emily!

48
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,140
Have some tea, too.

49
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,970
Thanks.

50
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,730
How I put this...

51
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,220
It's so relaxing.

52
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,510
Have you been down here before?

53
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,030
No.

54
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,870
I only know the names
of the monsters here and what they drop.

55
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,190
The monsters are cockroslimes,

56
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,500
and they drop pumpkins.

57
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,650
Slimes again?

58
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,040
But I look forward to meals
made with pumpkins.

59
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,050
So those are cockroslimes?

60
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,320
I bet girls would run away
screaming from these.

61
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,520
I mean, they look just like cockroa—

62
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,610
E-Emily, I don't think you
needed to go that hard...

63
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:24,450
What are you talking about, Yoda?

64
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,600
The tragedy will only grow
more widespread if I don't.

65
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,000
Not relaxing anymore!

66
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,830
I can't allow any to escape.

67
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,630
Um... Emily?

68
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,970
Hey, a drop.

69
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,240
I did it!

70
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,550
Well, we killed the cockroslimes.

71
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,170
Let's go up and get more carrots.

72
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,090
Okay!

73
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,110
We gotta get out of here, fast.

74
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,330
I don't want to see
that scary version of Emily again.

75
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,710
For every one you see...

76
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,890
you have to assume there are
thirty more you can't see!

77
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:38,040
Yoda... I might never regain my humanity!

78
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,770
Don't be hasty!
Let me do it!

79
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,200
Just let me take care of everything here!

80
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,490
I'm begging you!
Please let me take care of this!

81
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,100
I can't miss a single shot!

82
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:01,710
Have I ever concentrated so intently
on anything in all my life?

83
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,960
No... I haven't.

84
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,840
They're so big!
You've done it again, Yoda!

85
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,850
Yeah, but we can't take all these upstairs.

86
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,730
Those things will spawn again
if we stay here.

87
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,230
Do you want to kill them again?

88
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:22,190
O-Okay, just calm down for a minute...

89
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,810
Low-Level, I'm here for today's carrots.

90
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,130
Help yourself.

91
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,679
I-I'm saved...

92
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:49,130
Thank you as always!

93
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,930
We'll bring some more later.

94
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,020
Okay. I'll be waiting.

95
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,770
Aw, man.

96
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,280
I guess some animal got to them.

97
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,160
We can't sell these.

98
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,240
They're here...

99
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,500
But how?! We're outside the dungeon!

100
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,920
I have lived my entire life
for this moment.

101
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,930
You're getting a little intense there!

102
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:53,110
I'll do it! I'll kill them, okay?!

103
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,960
Give her back!

104
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,440
Give me my Emily back!

105
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,160
I did it. I killed them all.

106
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,090
I'm sorry.

107
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,760
I guess I turn into someone else
when I see those things.

108
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,130
It's not your fault, Emily.

109
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,950
You didn't know?

110
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:39,060
If you leave dropped items behind
where there are no people around,

111
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,120
monsters spawn around them.

112
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,280
I think Emily told me something like that
when the gorilla showed up,

113
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,250
but it didn't even register.

114
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,470
Yeah, and they ruined
the last of our pumpkins.

115
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,240
Sorry. I know you were waiting for them.

116
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,630
No problem.
We're still open, anyway.

117
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,890
We will be closing soon, though.

118
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:07,000
- So it's possible to force strays to spawn?
- Um, Ryota, if you don't mind...

119
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,230
- That means...
- Um, Ryota, if you don't mind...

120
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:12,030
Would you like to g-g-go out for dinner?

121
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,240
I found a great restaurant,

122
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,950
- and I thought—
- Thanks, Erza!

123
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,510
I'll be back!

124
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:22,900
What?!

125
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,870
Once I get an idea,

126
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:29,150
I have to act on it right away.

127
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,270
I got this carrot in Telulu earlier.

128
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,820
Is this gonna work?

129
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,660
You took the bait?!

130
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,800
Hey! That carrot—

131
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,200
This carrot is for a rabbit!

132
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:53,970
Even if Heaven and Earth switch places,
I won't give it up!

133
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,400
It's the longest sentence I've heard
you say, and it was to say that?!

134
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,830
Starting over...

135
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,380
Good thing I got so many of these.

136
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,580
I can't believe she took
nine out of ten, though...

137
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,710
Here we go!

138
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,230
It worked!

139
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,040
They say strays don't drop anything,

140
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,150
but for me...

141
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,820
Hang on...

142
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,190
What if I did this with those guys?

143
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,050
Boing.

144
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:55,090
Emily!

145
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:04,680
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1

146
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,130
RYOTA'S MAX HP INCREASED BY 0.
Ryota's max HP increased by 0.

147
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,680
No matter how many times I try,
they just vanish.

148
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,960
Turning monsters with no drops
into strays, then killing them...

149
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,380
With my unique skill,

150
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,510
something interesting
is about to happen...

151
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,950
RYOTA'S MAX HP INCREASED BY 0.
Ryota's max HP increased by 0.

152
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,540
Since my HP's already maxed out,

153
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,630
I thought I'd be able to carry the seeds back
without consuming them...

154
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,950
But I guess that won't work.

155
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,760
I'll just meet up with Emily in Telulu

156
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,710
and work hard to hunt down
today's supply of drops.

157
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,870
Damn! It'll turn into a stray!

158
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,370
No, actually, that's fine!

159
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,470
Huh?

160
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,920
Monsters disappear
if they leave a dungeon.

161
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,680
We'd have strays all over
the place otherwise.

162
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,430
So that's how it works.

163
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,790
Even within a dungeon, they disappear
if they enter a different floor.

164
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:34,020
That's why there's only one type
of monster on each floor.

165
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,520
I see.

166
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,180
You're a very talented adventurer,

167
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,940
but there's a surprising
amount you don't know.

168
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:48,790
Still, I think the contrast is...
k-kind of charming... or...

169
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,900
Thanks, Erza!

170
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,620
Huh?!

171
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,690
I'll be back!

172
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:54,700
Darn it!

173
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,560
Ryota, you jerk!

174
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,110
If my guess is right,
this should work.

175
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,270
There's one!

176
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,440
Just like before...

177
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:18,300
I have just a moment before it disappears.

178
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,940
If I kill it within that moment...

179
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,300
It worked!

180
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,940
If I kill it outside its floor,
it should count as a stray!

181
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,540
Ryota acquired a freezing bullet.

182
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,790
A freezing bullet?

183
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,470
This is incredible!

184
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,110
Depending on how I use them,
I could do a lot with these!

185
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,110
Now, Emily!

186
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,320
Got it!

187
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,580
Freeze it in place,
then hit it with a powerful attack.

188
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,380
It's a combo often used in games,
and it looks like we can do it here, too.

189
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,910
Yoda, that was amazing.

190
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,560
What was...
What was that, exactly?

191
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:37,520
Just what it looked like.
A bullet that freezes whatever it hits.

192
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,580
It takes time to get them, though,

193
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,320
so I can't fire a lot in succession.

194
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,190
They're quite valuable.

195
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,000
Yeah. So I'll stick with the regular bullets
unless it's an emergency.

196
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,440
You can just finish off the ones I miss.

197
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,760
Understood!

198
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,540
Looks like it's rained recently.

199
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,180
Watch your step.

200
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,890
Same to you.

201
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,150
I will.

202
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,819
Get it up here already!

203
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,010
Don't be crazy!

204
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,240
- You fool!
- Are they fighting?

205
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,850
Say what?!

206
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,780
Excuse me.
We'd like to get past.

207
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,260
Oh, you'll do.

208
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,560
Pull that cargo up for me.

209
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,120
This fool will pay you.

210
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,350
What?!

211
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:45,140
What in the...

212
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,840
Cargo?

213
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,030
Do you mean that?

214
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,700
Uh... If someone could drop
a rope to climb down,

215
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,520
I could probably get it,
though it wouldn't be easy...

216
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,880
Don't!

217
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,780
It's been quite a while since it fell.

218
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,660
It might turn into a stray, then!

219
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,880
That thing's loaded with drops
from some troublesome monsters.

220
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,690
We have to burn it up with magic
while we still can.

221
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,690
No!

222
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,540
Hey, watch it!

223
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,150
That perfume will sell for a fortune!

224
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:31,720
Do you have any idea how many adventurers
I hired to collect that much of it?!

225
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,600
Do you think I care?!

226
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,840
Besides, you're the one who dropped it!

227
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,030
The rain made you slip and lose it!

228
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,210
Well, you... are fired!

229
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,280
Huh?!

230
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,700
That's one very powerful old man!

231
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,570
I was too late.

232
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:53,610
What's that?

233
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,740
A monster called a Femini.

234
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,090
It doesn't have its own body.

235
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,240
It possesses a human and uses it
as a nursery to propagate itself.

236
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,330
That's not good!

237
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,940
It worked!

238
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,790
Take him and run!

239
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:21,630
Huh?

240
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,390
Hey! What are you gonna do?!

241
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:28,770
If I don't do something, Femini are
gonna pop out in all directions.

242
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,730
If I go down there and become a nursery,

243
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,220
I can buy time while you gather
an army in town.

244
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,570
But what will happen to you?

245
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,480
As the one hired to serve as
the escort on this mission,

246
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,540
I must take responsible for this accident!

247
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,440
Oh, boy, you've done it now.

248
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,010
The client's furious, y'know.

249
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,390
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

250
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,290
Gotta start all over now, huh?

251
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,340
You're not gonna get any sleep
for five days, but good luck!

252
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,310
Yes, sir.

253
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,340
Man, I could never survive that.

254
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,720
U-Uh...

255
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,620
It was my mistake,
so the responsibility is mine.

256
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,700
You have your own work to do, senior Sato.

257
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,440
I really did want to help.

258
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,820
But in the end,
all I could think about was myself.

259
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,130
What are you doing?!
Run away now!

260
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:40,760
No! Let me help!

261
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,530
It's not like that anymore.

262
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,980
The whole reason
I'm gaining more abilities

263
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,130
is for times like these!

264
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,370
Emily! Are you okay?!

265
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,840
Just like before...

266
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,740
I did it right!

267
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,290
Thank you. You saved us.

268
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,310
EMILY: LEVEL, STATUS

269
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,360
HP, MP, STRENGTH, VITALITY,
Your level went way up!

270
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,070
INTELLIGENCE, WILL, SPEED, DEXTERITY
It sure did! I could feel it!

271
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,400
I guess Femini are really strong monsters.

272
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,460
If you take out
that many of them at once,

273
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,280
of course your level's gonna go up.

274
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,910
It's all thanks to you.

275
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:51,800
If I stay with you,

276
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,290
I'm sure more good things will happen.

277
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,610
Nah, I'm the one...

278
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,890
who felt the same.

279
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:03,830
Oh, you are, too?
So we're the same!
