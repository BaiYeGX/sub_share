1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,660
I worked as a salaryman for a toxic company,
until I reincarnated...

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,950
in a crazy world where everything is
dropped by monsters in dungeons.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,830
In my new life, I'm level 1,
but I have a unique skill

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:21,000
that puts all of my drop rates at rank S.

5
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,750
Wait, no one's allowed into this dungeon?!

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,800
What even is a "Dungeon Master," anyway?!

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:45,280
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
EVEN AT LEVEL 1

8
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
YOU CAN DO IT!
GET 'EM, CELESTE!

9
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,479
Well done today!

10
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,740
And there's more!

11
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,700
I'll go get it!

12
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,250
She's going way too hard just
because my work here is easing up.

13
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,120
You've done very well, Ryota.

14
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,500
Thanks.

15
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,670
It's not like they've decided
Selen belongs to Secro yet, though.

16
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,350
Once that decision is made,
it'll truly be over.

17
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,220
Then we can go back to Secro
with nothing left to worry about.

18
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,970
I hope they make the decision quickly.

19
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,270
Ta-da! It's a cake!

20
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,480
What? How did you get that?

21
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,270
I baked it over the campfire.

22
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,150
Campfire? You mean... that campfire?

23
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,730
Celeste...

24
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,860
Don't think too hard about it.

25
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,200
Huh? But...

26
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,820
There's ice cream, too!

27
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,200
What?! How do you have ice cream?!

28
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,610
Celeste!

29
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,700
Ryota?

30
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,120
Try not to move.

31
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,170
It's a healing bullet.

32
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,670
Are you okay?

33
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,750
Yes... Huh?

34
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,680
Hey, Celeste, was that—

35
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,560
O-Oh, no!
Why is my heart pounding so hard?!

36
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,140
And my face feels hot!

37
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,770
C-Celeste...

38
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,900
Celeste?!

39
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,070
C-Calm down, Celeste!

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,900
I have calmed down.

41
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,200
R-Really?

42
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,820
Yes, really.

43
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,370
Anyway, weren't you about
to ask me something?

44
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,120
O-Oh...

45
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:28,330
You know, that trash you just burned...

46
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,120
There wasn't that much.

47
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,550
Did you really need to use
a huge spell like that on it?

48
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,590
That's the only one I can use.

49
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,380
Huh?

50
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,800
The level 3 fire magic spell, Inferno.

51
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,850
It's the only magic I can use.

52
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,100
Level 3? What about levels 1 and 2?

53
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,820
I can't use them.

54
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,570
Excuse us!

55
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:56,860
Of course.

56
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,330
I'll help you.

57
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,710
I have time now that my work's done.

58
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,590
It's a lot to handle alone, isn't it?

59
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,880
Th-Thank you...

60
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,600
But...

61
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,640
We keep burning and burning,
but it's not decreasing at all!

62
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,390
Is it always like this?!

63
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,400
Today is special.

64
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,230
Apparently, the Dungeon Master
has shown up.

65
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,440
Dungeon Master? What's that?

66
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,490
The boss of a dungeon.
They only show up once every few months.

67
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,740
They're very strong,
dangerous monsters.

68
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:47,990
No one's allowed to enter
the dungeon now because of it,

69
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,660
so everyone's just stress-eating.

70
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,790
And that led to this.

71
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,250
Ch-Cheer up!

72
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,460
They'll have a team together
to get rid of it in no time!

73
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,380
I'm sure things will be back
to normal by tomorrow!

74
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,930
You're right. Thank you.

75
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,600
Celeste, you should call it a day now.

76
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,270
I'll handle the rest.

77
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,890
What? I couldn't!

78
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:12,100
This is my—

79
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,150
If you keep this up,
you'll pass out again.

80
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:17,860
Just go and rest now.

81
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,940
You're always pushing yourself too hard.

82
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,700
So on that note, she's all yours, Emily.

83
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,870
Got it!

84
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,740
Come on, now, let's go!

85
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,910
What? W-Wait...

86
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,790
Okay, let's do this!

87
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,170
THE NEXT DAY

88
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,090
There's so much again today...

89
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,090
Yes...

90
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,010
It'll be all right.

91
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,260
The team to get rid of the Dungeon
Master should be assembled now.

92
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,850
I'll go check on where things stand, then.

93
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,190
You'll feel better knowing
there's an end in sight, right?

94
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,810
Y-Yes...

95
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,900
Okay, I'll go check it out.

96
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,070
Celeste, don't push yourself too hard!

97
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,030
Why?

98
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,280
What?

99
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,080
Why is Ryota so kind to me?

100
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:13,870
That's just the sort of person he is.

101
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,330
When he sees someone who
needs help, he can't ignore them.

102
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,000
It was the same in Secro, too.

103
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,920
In Secro, too?

104
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,880
Once that decision is made,
it'll truly be over.

105
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,110
Then we can go back to Secro
with nothing left to worry about.

106
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,720
Hey, if it isn't Sato.

107
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,020
What?

108
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,560
Neptune? Why are you here?

109
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,400
Since the Dungeon Master has appeared,

110
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,530
we've asked the Neptune Group
to come and help defeat it.

111
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:48,610
Perfect timing! That's why I'm here.

112
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,780
Please get rid of the Dungeon
Master as soon as possible.

113
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,790
I have a friend who's in trouble.

114
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,330
I'd love to do that myself, honestly.

115
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,920
Is there some reason you can't?

116
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,960
Things have gone a bit messy.

117
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,420
Messy?

118
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,470
Our agreement with Hetero dictates
that if a Dungeon Master appears,

119
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,430
the two towns must assemble
a joint force to defeat it.

120
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,220
We've decided to send
the Neptune Group from our side,

121
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,940
but Hetero isn't even making
an effort to pick anyone.

122
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,900
They won't even try? Why not?

123
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,110
Because that works out better for them.

124
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,440
If a Dungeon Master sticks
around for a long time,

125
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,320
the whole ecology
of its dungeon can change.

126
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,539
And if its ecology changes,
the items that drop there change, as well.

127
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,870
You mean...

128
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,539
Yes. The dungeon was
practically in Secro's hands,

129
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,539
but this might send us back to square one.

130
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,460
That's what Hetero is after.

131
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,470
I'll go in, then.

132
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,510
Forget about the joint force.

133
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,720
If I go after it on my own,
there's no problem, right?

134
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,470
No. I can't allow that, either.

135
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,770
Why not?!

136
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,560
They have an arrangement, too.

137
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
Huh?

138
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,780
Only a group of no less
than three adventurers

139
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,740
with stats ranked A or
higher are allowed in.

140
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,360
Why is that the rule?

141
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,780
That's just how dangerous
the Dungeon Master is!

142
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,660
I apologize.

143
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:20,120
Neptune, why don't you and I—

144
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,040
I can't.

145
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:26,300
We came here on a contract to be
Secro's part of the joint force.

146
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,550
I can't act on my own.

147
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,840
What are you gonna do?

148
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,390
I'll check around with the people here
to find some who'll help me.

149
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,890
That's not going to be easy.

150
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,980
Huh?

151
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,270
All the adventurers here

152
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,400
are people who came to profit off
of drops while they're tax-exempt.

153
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,740
None of them are ambitious enough
to take on a Dungeon Master.

154
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,290
Welcome back, Yoda!

155
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,040
I'm back... wait...

156
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,460
What's going on, Emily?

157
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,330
You're going to defeat
the Dungeon Master, aren't you?

158
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,380
I'm going with you!

159
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,460
I can always count on you.

160
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:14,010
Sorry, though. The two of us can't go
into the dungeon on our own.

161
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,140
We need one more—

162
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,350
I know.

163
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,750
I'm going, too.

164
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,520
Celeste?

165
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,730
You're going? What about the trash?

166
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,440
It's all right.
I found someone willing to help.

167
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,610
You found someone to help?

168
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,360
Hey!

169
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,990
Sis!

170
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,950
Eugene?!

171
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,040
This is the one who's agreed
to burn the trash in my place.

172
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,790
Huh?!

173
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,330
Just so you know, this isn't to apologize
for last time or anything!

174
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,500
I only agreed to do it
because she said she'd pay me!

175
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,380
O-Okay... Can you handle it
by yourself, though?

176
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,760
It's not just me!

177
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:57,760
Huh?

178
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,010
Come on, bring it over here.

179
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,980
They're...

180
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,230
So as you can see,
everything's gonna be fine!

181
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,520
Y-Yeah.

182
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,190
What's the holdup, Eugene?

183
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,110
Get over here and help us already.

184
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,030
Oh, shut up!

185
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:20,490
We can let them handle things here.

186
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,040
Yes, while we head to the dungeon.

187
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,420
W-Well... just having three
of us isn't enough, actually.

188
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,460
We all need to have stats
ranked A or higher to go in.

189
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,510
No problem there.

190
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,760
"CELESTE", LEVEL: 21/54, STATUS:
HP: D, MP: C, STRENGTH: E,

191
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,180
VITALITY: F, INTELLIGENCE: A,
WILL: A, SPEED: E

192
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,300
Your Intelligence and Will are ranked A?!

193
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,350
My drop rates are terrible, though.

194
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,100
"CELESTE", LEVEL: 21/54, DROP STATUS:
PLANTS, ANIMALS, MINERALS, MAGIC, SPECIALS

195
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,150
But if I'm with you,
you can go into the dungeon.

196
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,770
Are you really sure about this?

197
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,150
Yes.

198
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,360
You'll go back to Secro eventually.

199
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,280
So...

200
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,920
Please take me along. I want to help you.

201
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,210
Thanks, Celeste.

202
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,960
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom... screech!

203
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,050
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

204
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,720
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Once this is done, we can go home.

205
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,050
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
I want to go home right now.

206
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,350
SELEN LEVEL 1

207
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,060
There are... no monsters?

208
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,810
Right. While the Dungeon Master's around,

209
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,480
all the other monsters go away.

210
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,030
All other monsters leave?

211
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,990
What about all the drops, then?

212
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,910
There are no drops to find.

213
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,120
That's why we have to defeat
the Dungeon Master as soon as possible.

214
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,960
That's crazy.

215
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,310
Is that the Dungeon Master?

216
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,310
A horse with two horns...

217
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,110
I've heard of this before.

218
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,320
A beast that taints the pure...

219
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,400
The Bicorn!

220
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,200
Bicorn?

221
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,530
Let's do this, Emily!

222
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,410
Right!

223
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,620
Did that do it?!

224
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,010
Not so fast!

225
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,900
What the heck was that? A barrier?

226
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,320
I don't know!

227
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,740
Well, all we can do is keep pushing!

228
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,320
Celeste! Back me up!

229
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,110
Right!

230
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,700
Burn! Inferno!

231
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,000
It's staying in one place!

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,040
Now I can...

233
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,170
Emily!

234
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,220
Yes!

235
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,560
Again?!

236
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,330
It's okay! I can blow up its barrier
with bullet fusions!

237
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:37,910
I want to hit it with
the same chain of attacks again.

238
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,440
Can you do it, Celeste?

239
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
Yes, of course.

240
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,860
What?

241
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,110
Mr. Sato went to the dungeon?!

242
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,410
That's my Sato.
Nothing stops him.

243
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:51,410
This is not a laughing matter!

244
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,710
You know the Bicorn's power
poses a tremendous threat!

245
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,550
It sure is resilient.

246
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:05,300
I feel like we've done a lot of damage...

247
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,300
Then we just have to keep
going until it falls!

248
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,760
Yes, like what Emily said!

249
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,120
All right, then...

250
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,400
That looks like trouble!
We gotta stop it!

251
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,200
Right!

252
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,400
Emily!

253
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:30,620
Ryota has dropped two ranks
in all stats except HP and strength.

254
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:31,450
Wha—

255
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,370
Emily!

256
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,790
I'm all right!

257
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,210
But, Yoda, did it just...

258
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,470
Yeah. It lowered all my stats
other than HP and strength.

259
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,390
How about yours?

260
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,510
It lowered all of mine.

261
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,970
Is Celeste...

262
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,600
Celeste!

263
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,070
Celeste?

264
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,190
Oh, right. With her stats lowered,
her MP would be...

265
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,150
I can't let her push herself any farther.

266
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,700
Emily, take care of Celeste!

267
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,620
I'll take care of the rest.

268
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,620
Understood. Be careful.

269
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,710
I'm sorry.
I only ended up slowing you down.

270
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,630
That's not true.

271
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,590
You did more than enough to help us out.

272
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,880
So just rest for a while.

273
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:33,100
Your help isn't as important
as you yourself are.

274
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,480
No one's ever said anything
like that to me before...

275
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,610
Why are you so inefficient?!

276
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:49,700
Can't you burn that stuff any faster?

277
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,200
If you're gonna be sick, tell me first!

278
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,660
Save the collapsing for
after you finish the job!

279
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,040
People have only ever
said harsh things to me.

280
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,790
Since I can only use level 3 magic,

281
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,130
I just accepted it as natural.

282
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,880
That's not true.

283
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,220
You did more than enough to help us out.

284
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,730
I never knew...

285
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,240
...that someone's approval
could make me so happy.

286
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,150
Celeste?

287
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,030
I can't afford to rest.

288
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,490
I want to give my all...

289
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,370
right now!

290
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,460
Yoda!

291
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,580
Celeste?

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,590
Burn!

293
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,760
Inferno!

294
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,310
Yoda! Use this!

295
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,870
We did it!

296
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,710
Wait...

297
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,140
Celeste!

298
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,670
Celeste!

299
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,710
How about the Bicorn?

300
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,510
We defeated it!

301
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,430
Thanks, Celeste. We couldn't
have done it without you.

302
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,020
I'm so glad... I could be of help...

303
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:49,730
Here. Take these.

304
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,490
What are they?

305
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,200
The Bicorn's drop.

306
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,070
What? I can't accept
something so valuable!

307
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,580
Just take them.
Right, Emily?

308
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,410
Absolutely! They're all yours!

309
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,380
Celeste obtained Bicorn horns.

310
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,380
Celeste can now use level 1 magic
with no limitations.

311
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,630
Huh?

312
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,180
Emily and I talked it over.

313
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,720
We think you should have them.

314
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,140
Thank you for working
so hard to help us, Celeste!

315
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,860
Thank you...

316
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,830
You defeated the Dungeon Master?!

317
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,740
Yeah... er, Duke?

318
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,410
This is an unbelievable shock!

319
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,540
W-We must immediately
inform the adventurers

320
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:51,090
and have them see
if the dungeon ecology has changed!

321
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,000
Thank you, Mr. Sato!

322
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,760
It's amazing that just
three of you defeated it.

323
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,930
You've been blessed
with some wonderful companions.

324
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,310
Companions...

325
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,640
You were so amazing back there, Celeste!

326
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,270
So were you, Emily.

327
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,540
Yeah.

328
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,320
Hey, where's Neptune?

329
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,410
I missed my chance to fight with Sato.

330
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,450
And it's all because of
your stupid bullying.

331
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,540
Aw, man.

332
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,830
So... what are you gonna do about it?

333
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,390
Celeste.

334
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,980
Ryota!

335
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,770
These are amazing!

336
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:51,810
I never thought I'd be able
to use level 1 magic!

337
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:53,650
It's truly like a dream come true!

338
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,320
I'm glad you're so happy with it.

339
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,820
By the way, I heard that Selen
belongs to Secro from now on.

340
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,830
Yeah. They confirmed
that the dungeon's ecology didn't change.

341
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:09,580
A lot happened,
but now it's finally over.

342
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,420
So... when are you leaving for Secro?

343
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,000
Tomorrow, maybe?

344
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,300
I see.

345
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,760
Hey, Celeste... If you want...

346
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,490
- Why don't you come with us?
- I'll go with you!

347
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,100
What? You're asking me to?

348
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,600
Well, I mean...

349
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,020
Remember when they called us
"companions" yesterday?

350
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,570
I thought it might be nice
to really be like that...

351
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,650
so I was thinking of starting up...
like, "Ryota's Party," maybe.

352
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:42,070
I love it! Let's do that!

353
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,240
Oh, glad to hear it!

354
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,910
We'll have to talk to Emily—

355
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,330
I'm absolutely in!

356
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,000
You were there, Emily?!

357
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,960
Yes!

358
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,170
I'll be in the Yoda Family with Celeste!
It sounds like fun!

359
