1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:15,250
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
EVEN AT LEVEL 1

2
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:34,990
WE'RE ALL HAVING A PARTY

3
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,580
What?!

4
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,590
Don't tell me...

5
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,670
None of my attacks work on it?!

6
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,530
The last one I shot was a homing bullet.

7
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,160
All of my special bullets have
gone right through it now.

8
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,630
Even fusion bullets don't work.

9
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,010
It's both faster and stronger than me.

10
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,850
So I have no way to win!

11
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,780
But that doesn't mean
I can just give up!

12
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,940
What?

13
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,320
That's...

14
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:56,780
I see!

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,050
Yes!

16
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,980
When you attack,

17
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,460
the body part you attack
with becomes corporeal.

18
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,980
The bullet you pulled out of
your foot a minute ago...

19
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,900
was a homing bullet.

20
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:40,450
And its homing capabilities kicked
in the instant it became corporeal.

21
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,660
Once I figured that out,

22
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,330
I just had to fire more homing bullets.
It didn't matter where.

23
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,710
They'd always react to
your attacks and hit you.

24
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,050
I'm out of homing bullets,

25
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,630
but now that I've shaved down
your speed and power,

26
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,100
you're much closer to my level!

27
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,560
And if our strength is equal...

28
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:06,020
I'm the one who'll win!

29
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,210
Yoda!

30
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,420
Yoda! Yoda!

31
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,550
Yoda! Are you all right?

32
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,800
Emily...

33
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,380
You came here looking for me?

34
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,390
Ow...

35
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,470
You're injured all over!

36
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,390
A healing bullet will fix me right up.

37
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:18,010
I guess I needed you to save me again.

38
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,790
What are you talking about?

39
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,760
Items are dropping in dungeons again.

40
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,560
You've saved everyone in Secro, Yoda.

41
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,440
But...

42
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,620
Even if it's to help people,

43
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,980
I wish you wouldn't
push yourself so hard.

44
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,360
You always try too hard.

45
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,290
Even if you can be healed,
getting injured still hurts!

46
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,250
Thanks, Emily.

47
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,290
But I wasn't even thinking
about saving the town.

48
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,710
I just started running here
without even realizing it.

49
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:01,220
I don't want you to push yourself too hard,

50
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,550
but I forgot that's just how you are.

51
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,540
Pushing myself was worth it.

52
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,230
Now you can make
bean sprout soup for me again.

53
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,230
Yes, I'll go home and make some.

54
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,580
Is this what the dungeon master dropped?

55
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,790
When this ring is equipped...

56
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:42,380
I want to tell everyone in town right away
that you fixed the problem.

57
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,180
Nah, I don't like attracting
too much attention.

58
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,260
Besides, like I said before,

59
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,930
I didn't do it to save the town.
It was... well...

60
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,400
Ryota!

61
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,560
Don't go off into danger alone!

62
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,440
Let me help you!

63
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,990
Sorry. I'll do that from now on.

64
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,910
It didn't seem like one that would
become a new friend for me.

65
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,160
Nope, not that one.
Try something else.

66
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,710
I haven't had enough of your carrots!

67
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,750
Okay, okay.
I'll stop by Telulu on the way home.

68
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,340
I'll go, too!

69
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,840
Then, so will I.

70
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,510
Carrots! Quick!

71
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,170
We'll all go together!

72
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:33,560
This is probably the reason
I couldn't give up.

73
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,860
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1

74
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,530
The dungeon master's drop...

75
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:48,450
If the description I heard yesterday is true,
it's incredibly powerful.

76
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,340
And that's ten.

77
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,260
Hey, Mr. Sato!

78
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,890
Hey, working hard again today, huh?

79
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,270
G-Good morning.

80
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,480
You know, that idea you had
about selling rings...

81
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,610
I don't think it's gonna work for a while.

82
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,780
It means dragons are our main target,

83
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,450
and our princess can't finish
one of those off alone.

84
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,659
Well, yeah, I guess not.

85
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:36,159
Even though her level is high...

86
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,580
Is she?

87
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,169
Her maximum level is 99,
and she's level 94 now.

88
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,630
She'll reach 95 soon.

89
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,540
Huh?

90
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,510
MARGARET- LEVEL 94/99 - STATUS: HP, MP,
See? It's just as I said.

91
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,640
STRENGTH, VITALITY, INTELLIGENCE, WILL: F
Yeah...

92
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,180
STRENGTH, VITALITY, INTELLIGENCE, WILL: F

93
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,230
So even though her level keeps
going up, her abilities don't.

94
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,440
It's gotta suck when none of the work
you put in ever pays off.

95
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,610
Give me your hand.

96
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,650
Like this?

97
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,620
I leveled up!

98
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,990
Huh?!

99
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,330
A ring that turns any experience gained
after maxing out your level into a crystal.

100
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,550
I couldn't quite believe it,
but now I know it works.

101
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,420
What?!

102
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:29,260
What is it?

103
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,090
They've gone up... They've gone up!

104
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:32,970
MARGARET- LEVEL 95/99 - DROP STATUS: PLANTS,
Huh?!

105
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,010
ANIMALS, MINERALS, MAGIC, SPECIALS: E
Huh?!

106
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,270
That's awesome! All your
hard work is paying off...

107
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,140
Wait, hang on.
Give me your hand again.

108
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,310
Okay...

109
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,240
I leveled up again!

110
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,030
MARGARET- LEVEL 96/99 - DROP STATUS: PLANTS,
What?!

111
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,660
ANIMALS, MINERALS, MAGIC, SPECIALS: D
I knew it!

112
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,200
What do you mean?!

113
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,910
The princess is a majorly late bloomer.

114
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:00,790
Her drop rates hit E at level 95,
and D at level 96.

115
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,000
So when she reaches level 99,
they'll all be A!

116
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,170
I'm sure of it!

117
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,000
Long live Princess Margaret!

118
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,380
So everything I've done
really hasn't been a waste.

119
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,470
You taught me that.

120
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:18,010
Nah, I wanted to try those
things out, anyway.

121
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Remember when I asked you to accept
my first ring the last time we met?

122
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,730
Well...

123
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:31,490
I'd really like it if you would
accept all of my firsts.

124
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,740
Nah, it wouldn't be right
for me to take that much.

125
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,290
Well, there's something
I wanna do. See ya later.

126
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,540
Banzai! Banzai! Banzai!

127
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,210
I hit up all the greengrocers in town

128
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,960
and bought all the bean sprouts
and carrots they had.

129
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,130
I'm going to get all of us leveled up.

130
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:58,550
Um... Do you mean we're going to turn all of
these into strays and kill them together?

131
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,470
I have an even more efficient way.

132
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:07,400
This turns leftover experience into
crystals that I can give to others.

133
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,440
Is that what the dungeon master
dropped yesterday?

134
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,110
Is that really possible?

135
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,380
Yeah. Alice has maxed out her level,

136
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,600
so that leaves Emily,
Celeste, and Eve, right?

137
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,660
Mine's maxed out, too.
More importantly...

138
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,960
Carrots are for eating.

139
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:32,050
Eve, if you'll just be patient,
Yoda will give you even tastier carrots.

140
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,630
Y-Yeah, that's right. I will.

141
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,100
Okay. I'll be patient.

142
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Well, let's get started, then.

143
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,610
The regular bullets they drop
go into my pouch automatically,

144
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,610
so I won't run out.

145
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:58,740
Emily and Celeste,
take turns picking them up!

146
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,700
Oh! I leveled up!

147
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,290
He's totally perfected this whole process.

148
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,380
He's the very image
of a first-class adventurer.

149
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:17,050
Did I just... join the party
of someone genuinely amazing?

150
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,590
Yoda really is incredible!

151
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,260
You're amazing, Ryota!

152
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,890
That's our Ryota!

153
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,100
Amazing, Yoda!

154
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,400
EMILY - LEVEL 40/40 - STATUS:
Wow! My level's maxed out!

155
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,570
EMILY - LEVEL 40/40 - STATUS:
And my vitality went up to A, too!

156
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,490
STRENGTH, VITALITY, INTELLIGENCE,

157
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,740
STRENGTH, VITALITY, INTELLIGENCE,
One of your drop rates went up a little, too.

158
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,280
STRENGTH, VITALITY, INTELLIGENCE,
Yes!

159
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,570
WILL, SPEED, DEXTERITY, LUCK
It's your turn next, Celeste.

160
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,330
EMILY - LEVEL 40/40 - DROP STATUS:

161
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,040
CELESTE - LEVEL 54/54 - STATUS:

CELESTE - LEVEL 54/54 - STATUS:

163
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,300
DROP STATUS: PLANTS: F, ANIMALS: F,
MINERALS: F, MAGIC: E, SPECIALS:  F

164
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,050
You're not an F Final anymore.

165
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:02,340
Thank you!

166
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,600
Thank you from me, too.

167
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,560
But it's a little sad that you're
not getting any experience

168
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,400
when you're working so hard.

169
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,650
Nope, I'm getting experience.

170
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,400
It's just not expressed as a number.

171
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,570
I've gained a lot through
my experiences in this world.

172
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,160
And now I have an item

173
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,500
that lets me use all that I've built up
to share experience with you guys.

174
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,000
Yoda...

175
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Anyway, now that we've all
maxed out our levels,

176
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,210
I guess the Ryota Family is ready
to move on to the next stage!

177
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,460
Yeah!

178
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
Next carrot?

179
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,390
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
It's all you now! Go, Emily!

180
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,470
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
Uh... Yay!

181
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,060
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

182
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,770
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
And now...

183
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,390
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1
A word from the director!

184
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,060
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

185
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,490
So that's the Ryota Family?

186
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,820
They only just got together,
but they're on fire.

187
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,250
The one with the hammer, Emily,
has a merchant who provides her weapons.

188
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:15,670
The pretty magic user, Celeste,
also excels in intel gathering.

189
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,960
They've even tamed the Killing Rabbit.

190
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:23,880
And I heard the new girl they just
took in can command monsters!

191
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:29,310
That Ryota Sato guy's pulled
together quite a crew.

192
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,350
But as long as just one of us has a license,

193
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,150
no one else going into a dungeon
with them needs one, right?

194
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:41,070
Yeah, but if you do have one,
it could come in handy someday.

195
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,780
Besides, the more members
we have with licenses,

196
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,240
the stronger our family will look.

197
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,580
And it'll be easier to get
quests if we need them.

198
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,250
Today, we'll be getting licenses

199
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:55,330
for Emily and Celeste to go below
the fifth level of Telulu.

200
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,460
With your skills, it shouldn't be a problem.

201
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,800
Alice, this will be a lesson to prepare
you to get your own license.

202
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,590
And Eve—

203
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:06,760
I have a license.
I'm waiting for your carrots.

204
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,390
Oh, right. Got it.

205
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,480
I can definitely tell
they're with you, my man!

206
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,900
They both pass with flying colors!

207
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,440
We've all maxed out our levels now,

208
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,110
and Emily and Celeste have their licenses.

209
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:30,240
I think our family's
in a good place right now.

210
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,540
I agree!

211
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,120
Ryota, what are we gonna do next?

212
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,080
Let's act individually for a while.

213
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,000
What?

214
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,550
We'll head out to separate hunting
grounds where we can make

215
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,960
the most of our talents.

216
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,260
I want to get an idea of what
we can all do around here,

217
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,930
and how much profit
we can make on average.

218
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,680
I get it now!

219
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,350
That's certainly important.

220
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,480
I'll get you all some potions
to boost drop rates.

221
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,270
Use them whenever you need.

222
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,480
And even if you don't earn as much
as you'd like, no working overtime.

223
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,190
There'll be days like that.

224
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,110
We'll do our best to get together
for lunch and dinner every day.

225
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,820
Dismissed!

226
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,990
Yes, sir!

227
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,460
Okay, let's all announce our results.

228
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:31,090
My average over six days was the equivalent
of 120,000 pilos per day, a new record.

229
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,470
Why "the equivalent"?

230
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,100
Because I ate them all.

231
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,770
You ate 120,000 pilos'
worth times six days?!

232
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,150
I made 160,000 pilos,

233
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,190
also a personal best!

234
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:48,360
We earned... 215,123 pilos.

235
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,870
That's a little over
100,000 for each of us.

236
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:56,370
And I made... 1,560,000 pilos.

237
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,460
This means if we're all together,

238
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,960
we can rake in about two million a day.

239
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,250
I know that for sure now.

240
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,880
Is there something you plan to buy?

241
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,260
Yeah, something I've been putting off.

242
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,839
Magic carts for all of us!

243
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,140
Here goes!

244
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,230
Wow! What just happened?!

245
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,490
Anything that'll fit
in the magic cart can be sent over.

246
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,730
It's Orton's latest model.

247
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,330
Eve's already mastered hers.

248
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,210
That's very handy.

249
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,670
If one of us gets stuck
in a dungeon with a full cart,

250
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,750
we can keep hunting instead
of returning to town.

251
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,550
Hey, Ryota...
Can I ask one question?

252
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,680
What's up?

253
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,760
How do we get these to the trader?

254
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,680
Uh...

255
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,430
So anyway...

256
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,020
If we gather everything
together at home first,

257
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:07,230
we'll probably still have to make
multiple trips between there and here.

258
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,700
Just a day's worth of your own
trips here is already amazing.

259
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:16,240
Your record so far is sixteen trips!

260
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,040
I'm impressed you remember that.

261
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,830
Only because it's you, Mr. Sato.

262
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,830
Go do your own work, Eyna!

263
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,880
Yeah, yeah.

264
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:31,760
M-More importantly, you'll continue to
do all your business with us, right?

265
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,850
Yeah. You've done so much for me.

266
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,550
I came to talk about this because
I want to keep that going.

267
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,220
All right.

268
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,810
I'll talk to the owner.

269
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,060
So there you have it.

270
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,690
Erza's going to work exclusively
for us from now on.

271
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,150
I look forward to it.

272
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,740
So you'll do all the counting here,

273
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,030
and make the arrangements
to have them collected?

274
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,280
That's wonderful.

275
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,700
And you'll be here every day,
except for holidays?

276
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,040
You're basically a member
of the Yoda Family now!

277
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,460
Now we've really got
nothing left to worry about!

278
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,790
We can all go hunt
to our hearts' content!

279
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,380
Yeah!

280
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,090
I think...

281
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,720
I'm really glad I was sent here
from my old world.

282
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,600
This is a welcome party for Erza, right?

283
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,430
I get why Eyna's here. But...

284
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,400
Why are you here?

285
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,190
I've been wanting to come
and see your house.

286
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:33,150
Don't show up when you weren't invited!

287
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,280
You even brought your party mates!

288
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,240
What's the problem?

289
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,910
Yoda, more people make a party more fun!

290
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,500
See? You heard your partner.

291
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,870
That's right!

292
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,540
Jeez... All right, fine.

293
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,670
Yes?

294
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,760
Um, um...

295
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,010
I haven't thanked you yet
for the last time, so please...

296
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,890
They're just flowers,
but if you'll accept them...

297
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,430
Oh... Why don't you come in?

298
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,850
We'd love to come in, Mr. Sato!

299
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,650
We had an idea
for the princess's next new product,

300
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,980
but we wanted your opinion!

301
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,030
Can we save that for next time?

302
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,610
More people make a party more fun!

303
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,060
Thank you for having us.

304
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:23,870
Yo! How is it?

305
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,950
Daddy!

306
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,910
You can't just go in without permission!

307
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,080
Come on in!

308
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,170
It'll be more fun with lots of people!

309
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,220
Sato, I brought this up to thank you.

310
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:38,930
Huh?

311
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:43,760
You're the one who defeated
the dungeon master, right?

312
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,890
It's a year's supply of sugar cubes.

313
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:48,520
Don't say anything!
Just accept it!

314
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,190
I'd really rather not!

315
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,520
Low-Level!

316
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,400
Not enough carrots.

317
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,820
Ryota!

318
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:02,410
The ratio of women to men in this room
is not nearly high enough!

319
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,530
Hey, Ryota!

320
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,960
Bonesy and Jiggly say they
want to be friends with Olga!

321
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,000
You're all more than welcome!

322
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,170
A lively party with lots of people
is the most fun of all!

323
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,760
When I came to this world,

324
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,180
I was given a unique skill.

325
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,890
I was incredibly fortunate.

326
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,980
I wonder what the old me
would think if he saw this.

327
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,230
But...

328
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,150
What makes me even more fortunate is...

329
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:56,130
It looks like we might not have enough food.

330
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,010
I'll go out to the dungeon and get more.

331
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:01,340
In that case,
we'll go with you!

332
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:10,060
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
EVEN AT LEVEL 1
