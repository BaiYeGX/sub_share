1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,250
Ugh...!

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,860
What is this sound?

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,990
Sounds like something
from a video game.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:13,370
So sleepy...

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,950
I don't want to wake up.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,370
Is this... a human?

7
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:21,880
But it's a drop.

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,950
I see.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,300
This must be a meat
shaped like a human.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,220
Let’s try cutting off a piece...

11
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,880
TELLURIUM B1
Hold it right there!

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,640
TELLURIUM B1

13
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,550
Y-You startled me!

14
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,140
You're an actual human?

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,810
What else do I look like?
I'm clearly a human!

16
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:42,480
Why did a slime drop a human?

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,860
Slime? Drop?

18
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:46,480
It's strange.

19
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,570
Slime only drop bean sprouts.

20
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:52,070
Again, slime and drop?

21
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,240
Are you all right in the head?

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,990
You really don't know?

23
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,290
Know what?

24
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,600
Watch me.

25
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:04,040
A SLIME APPEARED
A slime?

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,260
Watch out!

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,430
Hey!

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,930
I'm... FINE!

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,140
Why bean sprout?!

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,690
Bean sprouts are what slimes drop
on B1 of Tellurium.

31
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,400
It's basic knowledge.

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,480
Not to me, that's for sure.

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,320
What in the world is this?

34
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,990
What the hell is all this?!

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:50,214
MY UNIQUE SKILL
MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,960
A HUMAN DROPPED BY A SLIME

37
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,170
Hey, are bean sprouts
made like this around here?

38
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,010
The bean sprouts?

39
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:20,430
Or rather, everything are.

40
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,220
Everything?

41
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,810
Everything in this world
comes from drops in dungeons.

42
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,270
So you really don't know anything?

43
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:32,690
Hey...

44
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,480
Yes?

45
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,450
Are we not in Japan?

46
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,820
Japan?

47
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,570
We're in earth, right?

48
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,280
Earth?

49
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,580
What the heck is going on?

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,880
Phew.

51
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,050
I see you've been fighting
nothing but slimes so far.

52
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,130
Are you not going after other monsters?

53
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,680
There are only slimes in B1 of Tellurium.

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,850
You're not going to other floor?

55
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,560
I'm weak.

56
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,220
It doesn't seem like it to me.

57
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,730
If my level goes up,
then maybe I can go to B2.

58
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,860
Level?

59
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,360
There is a level?

60
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,730
Of course.

61
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,990
Oh, how about I show you?

62
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,700
Here it is.

63
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,820
What's this?

64
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,910
It's called a status board.

65
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,660
EMILY - LEVEL 3/40 - STATUS:

66
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,950
This is my status.

67
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,790
HP, MP, STRENGTH, VITALITY, INTELLIGENCE,
WILL, SPEED, DEXTERITY, LUCK

68
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,080
It really is like a video game.

69
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,130
Her HP is B, and her Strength is C...

70
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,290
And...

71
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,710
Her status is basically
like a brawler build.

72
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,680
There is a second page?

73
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,800
Yes.

74
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,040
This is my drop status.

75
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,600
EMILY- LEVEL 3/40 - DROP STATUS:
PLANTS, ANIMALS, MINERALS, MAGIC, SPECIAL

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,810
What do you get when those goes up?

77
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:51,690
The higher they are the easier it is to get
drops and the more plentiful it will be.

78
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:56,980
My stat for plants is the highest,
so I go here for bean sprouts.

79
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,490
Rather than 'high,' it's more that
it was the better one out of the rest.

80
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,950
Would you like to give a try?

81
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,200
Yeah.

82
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,660
So I just touch it?

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,170
RYOTA - LEVEL 1/1 - STATUS: HP, MP, STRENGTH,
Very low stats.

84
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,750
INTELLIGENCE, WILL, SPEED, DEXTERITY, LUCK
Level 1...

85
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,170
So my level cap at level 1?
That means I can't go up from there?

86
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,180
That would be the case.

87
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,640
You got to be kidding me...

88
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:28,100
Very low drops, too.

89
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,650
I've nothing good to go for, huh?

90
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,860
Um, A, B, C, D, E, F...

91
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,940
Q, R, S...

92
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,740
They're all really bad.

93
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,360
What?

94
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,820
RYOTA - LEVEL 1/1 - DROP STATUS:
PLANTS, ANIMALS, MINERALS, MAGIC, SPECIAL

95
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,160
When it's this low, you maybe
won't get any drop at all.

96
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,580
Wait a minute.

97
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,040
"S" is low?

98
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,080
Huh?

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,000
I mean...

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,460
- A, B, C...
- No, from what I usually see,

101
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,920
S is higher than A.

102
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,210
Is that not the case in here?

103
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,210
I'll give it try.

104
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,630
What are you looking for?

105
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,880
Something I can use as a weapon.

106
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,140
Would you like to use mine?

107
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,140
Thank—

108
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:12,810
How much does this weight? 100kg?

109
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,020
I-I'm sorry!

110
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,320
How about this?

111
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,190
Ryota has obtained a bamboo stick.

112
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,700
This seems great.

113
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,820
A slime is coming.

114
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,410
A SLIME APPEARED
Oh!

115
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,330
A SLIME APPEARED
All right!

116
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,130
You did it!

117
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,050
Whoa!

118
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,630
A-Amazing!

119
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,430
Have you got this much before?

120
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,430
No!

121
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,140
I've been here for about two years,

122
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,270
but I've never seen a drop this plentiful.

123
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,060
Which means...

124
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,190
I knew it.
S is higher than A.

125
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,190
Have you seen other people
with S rank drop?

126
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,820
I haven't.

127
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,610
I've never even heard of it before.

128
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,740
I see...

129
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,530
Let's eat something first.

130
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,910
Here you go.

131
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,750
Thank you.

132
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,290
I'll have it.

133
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,260
Delicious!

134
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,550
The crispy texture
of the bean sprouts paired well

135
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,260
with the slight spiciness
of the chili oil dressing!

136
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,140
This would go great with alcohol.

137
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,770
It would?

138
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,440
You never had one before?

139
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,150
No.

140
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,860
Besides, it's too expensive to me.

141
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,150
You can have this, too.

142
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,030
Thanks!

143
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,950
It's warm...

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Wh-What's wrong?

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,710
Was it that bad?!

146
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:01,130
No, that's not it.

147
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,090
It's just that it's been such a long time
since I've eaten...

148
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,090
...a warm meal with someone.

149
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,890
I'd head out early in the morning.

150
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,600
Work late into the night.

151
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,310
And eat some cold convenience store food
I could find.

152
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,770
I'd worked myself so hard
that I ended up in the hospital.

153
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,970
And to get back the hours
I'd lost not working...

154
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,510
...I work overtime again.

155
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,990
And when I took a nap
after missing the last train home...

156
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,120
And the next thing I know,
I got dropped by a slime.

157
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:41,669
It really was a hellish life
where nothing I do gets rewarded.

158
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,800
I remember someone said this before.

159
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,260
Those who strive will always be rewarded.

160
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:54,180
It maybe sooner,
or it maybe later.

161
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,810
But those who works hard
will surely find their happiness.

162
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,850
Furthermore...

163
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,270
The longer they go without being rewarded,

164
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,400
the better the reward will be.

165
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,780
It's like pushing your finger against your thumb
when you're about to pluck something.

166
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,910
The longer you push,
the harder the pluck.

167
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:20,710
That's why the most incredible of us
are rewarded in the next life.

168
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sure you did your very best.

169
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,130
That's why now is your turn...

170
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,960
...to get all the reward you deserve.

171
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,810
Thank you.

172
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,310
I guess it's time for me
to find a place to sleep.

173
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,900
There is a town right outside the dungeon.

174
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,280
You can look for an inn there.

175
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,490
I should be taking a sleep, too.

176
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,700
Wait, you're staying here?

177
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,820
Yes.

178
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:59,200
My drop rates are low,
so I can't afford a place to stay.

179
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,660
It's my dream to rend
an apartment one day.

180
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,670
What?

181
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,500
I see.

182
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,760
Oh, you should take this.

183
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,550
Really? Are you sure?

184
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,430
It's dangerous to go without a weapon.

185
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,800
Okay.

186
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,220
I'll borrow it.
I will return it someday.

187
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,970
Got it.

188
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:22,890
You can find me here anytime
on B1 of Tellurium.

189
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,060
What's your name?

190
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,860
Emily Brown.

191
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,440
Emily?

192
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,780
I'm Ryota Sato.

193
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,110
Yoda Hello?

194
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:36,200
RYO-TA SA-TO!

195
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,540
I've never heard a name like that before.

196
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:43,790
I learned a few things.

197
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,790
The currency here is Piro.

198
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,540
That pile of bean sprouts
was worth 200 piro.

199
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,340
A night at a cheap inn was 2,000 piro.

200
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,260
A bowl of ramen-like stuff was 500 piro.

201
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,220
I've also confirmed the price
for the thing I want.

202
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,680
Which means, all left is...

203
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,680
TELLURIUM B1

204
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,700
When I learned I was level 1,

205
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,480
I thought I'd be in for more hellish life
with no reward, but...

206
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,070
"Drop Rate All-S"....

207
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,740
With this ultimate skill,
I'll make a better life this time through!

208
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,850
Huh?

209
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,830
What's this place?

210
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,820
I rented it.

211
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,540
With my three whole days of earnings.

212
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,830
Only three days?!

213
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,500
That's incredible, Yoda!

214
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,260
Well, it's a run-down
87-years-old apartment.

215
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,430
So no key money or a security deposit.

216
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,930
This is the best I could afford
in three days.

217
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,100
But it's still incredible.

218
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,470
How much was it?

219
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,310
Twenty thousand piro a month.

220
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,600
Twenty thousand...
That's a lot.

221
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,520
It's wonderful!

222
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,770
And here.

223
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,650
What is it?

224
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,240
A key.

225
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,780
Huh? Why are you giving it to me?

226
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,330
Because this is a home now.

227
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,450
For who?

228
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,540
You, of course.

229
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,710
I'll pay for the loan for you,
so no need to worry.

230
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,050
N-No, I couldn't possibly—

231
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,630
It's my thank for the soup.

232
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,510
Your soup that day was great.

233
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,010
It was warm.

234
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,470
So this is my thanks.

235
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,850
I know this isn't that great of a house,
but I want you to have it.

236
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,020
Okay...

237
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,190
Well, I'll get going now.

238
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:37,780
Your hands are full of blisters.

239
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,070
Huh? Oh, sorry.

240
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,250
The spear I borrowed might have
some blood from popped blisters on it.

241
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,330
I'll wash it well
before I return it to you.

242
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,080
You have bangs under your eyes, too.

243
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,040
You know, right?
Real work starts after you have bags.

244
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,460
I'll make you soup.

245
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,090
Okay. I guess I'll take a bowl—

246
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,550
I'll make it over and over.

247
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,890
So let's eat it together.

248
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,810
A-Are you saying...

249
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,520
You want me to live here with you?

250
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,060
Are you sure?

251
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,080
Okay?

252
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,320
H-Hip hip, up.

253
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:22,700
Here!

254
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,990
Why?!

255
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,460
Count this for me, Erza.

256
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:38,420
Okay, please wait a moment.

257
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,300
Um, Sato Yoda, was it?

258
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,760
It's Ryota!

259
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:48,560
I'm sorry.
Your name is hard to remember.

260
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,480
That would be 1,967 piro in all.

261
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,690
You always bring us so many,

262
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,110
so I'll bump that up to 2,000 piro.

263
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,940
Thank you.

264
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,310
But in the end,
they're still bean sprouts.

265
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:05,490
Not really something that
rake in big bunks, eh?

266
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,830
Maybe I should try B2 of Tellurium.

267
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,750
The monsters in B2 drop carrots.

268
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,330
So surreal! Too surreal!

269
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:19,130
But this is what's normal in this world.

270
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,300
Oh, have you heard
about the new dungeon?

271
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,760
New? Do dungeons appear out of thin air?

272
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,270
Yes. Every once in a while.

273
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,560
Though the new dungeon has
a rather difficult name to pronounce.

274
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,190
The name was Niho...
No, Nihonium, I think.

275
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,820
Nihonium?

276
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,110
That's easy to pronounce.

277
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,030
You think so?

278
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,540
Anyway, the Neptune group
is investigating the drops there,

279
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,530
so we should learn
more details before long.

280
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,580
The Neptune group?

281
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,160
Haven't you heard of them?

282
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,920
They're the biggest organization
here in Cyclo.

283
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,790
Oh...

284
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:01,460
Sorry for hogging you for so long.
I'd better go now.

285
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,260
Wait!

286
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,550
There's a new shop on the corner
that sells delicious beer!

287
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,020
I-If you don't mind, would you like
to go there with me today?

288
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,520
Beer, huh...

289
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,020
Sorry. I'll have to pass today.

290
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,360
See you later.

291
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,480
Y-Yes... Later...

292
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,860
Aww, he rejected you.
That's a shame.

293
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,200
I-It's not like that at all!

294
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:31,160
It has been decades since I return home
where someone is waiting for me.

295
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,620
What should I say?

296
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,000
I know...

297
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,920
I-I'm... home...

298
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,090
Welcome back!

299
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,050
I-I'm home...

300
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,130
Yes, welcome back!

301
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,140
The place looks... so clean now.

302
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,680
Yes. I spent the entire day cleaning.

303
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,270
Cleaning?

304
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,480
That doesn't even begin to describe it...

305
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,060
Did I do something wrong?

306
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,440
This is my first time
cleaning an apartment.

307
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,020
So I went all-out.

308
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,650
Here, Yoda.
Have a towel.

309
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,700
Aaaah! This feels great!

310
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,450
Thank you, Emily!

311
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,280
Have a tea, too.

312
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,160
You've got tea, too?!

313
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,000
Yes. Please sit hit and have a break.

314
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,000
You don't have to do that much.

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,500
Why don't you take a rest?

316
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,590
You must be tired.

317
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,130
Being able to do things around my home
is new and exciting!

318
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,890
I'm not tired at all!

319
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,880
Well, that's fine, I guess...

320
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,350
By the way,
I hear a new dungeon just appeared.

321
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:40,060
Nihonium, or something.

322
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,440
I've heard of that, too.

323
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,400
They say it's a bust dungeon
where nothing dropped.

324
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,610
Nothing dropped?

325
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,280
Dungeons dropped pretty much
everything in this world.

326
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,310
NIHONIUM B1
So a place that supposedly dropped nothing

327
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,950
NIHONIUM B1
piqued my interest.

328
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,500
Nobody here...

329
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,250
It's been completely abandoned.

330
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,790
So really nothing dropped in here?

331
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,300
Huh?

332
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,390
I'm dead!

333
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,740
So this is the full capacity of level 1...

334
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,110
I didn't know I was this weak.

335
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,750
What is this?

336
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,460
A seed?

337
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,500
What?

338
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,550
Ryota's max HP went up by 1.

339
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:55,680
RYOTA - LEVEL 1/1 - STATUS: HP, MP, STRENGTH,
INTELLIGENCE, WILL, SPEED, DEXTERITY, LUCK

340
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,310
You're still level 1
but your HP has gone up!

341
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:02,020
- Yoda, this is incredible!
- I knew it.

342
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,940
That seed's effect was a real deal.

343
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,280
Following this, I decided to fight
some more skeletons.

344
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:13,030
And after I meet up with Emily,
I learned a few things.

345
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:17,950
That seed didn't drop when
Emily defeat a skeleton.

346
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,370
The seed that I dropped would pass by
Emily's hand when she try to grab it.

347
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,500
And only I can hear that voice.

348
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,800
Ryota's max HP went up by 1.

349
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,970
This is unthinkable.

350
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,510
That's right.

351
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,550
A drop that can only be obtained

352
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:39,810
by a select people might ruin
this world's balance.

353
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,600
That's why these seeds
weren't supposed to exist.

354
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,270
But here they are.

355
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,230
Incredible!

356
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,690
I have never heard of anyone
getting stronger without leveling up!

357
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,450
That means, this Nihonium...

358
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,870
...is a status increase dungeon
for those with S rank drops!

359
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,580
Yummy!

360
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,250
Emily's house is the best!

361
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,380
Yoda, are you going
to be out late today, too?

362
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,670
Yeah!

363
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,300
I've been going to Nihonium a lot lately.

364
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,300
And now my max HP
finally has gone up to S!

365
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,970
Today I'm going to B2 of Tellurium

366
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,060
to check how strong I am right now.

367
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,520
What's the matter?

368
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,980
Why the long face?

369
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,940
Please don't push yourself too much.

370
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,650
What?

371
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,610
You often do crazy things.

372
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,400
When you rented this place...
you looked terribly tired.

373
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,160
And lately, you often stay out so late.

374
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,870
If possible, I love to see you home
before nightfall.

375
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,670
Back then, nobody worried
about my well-being.

376
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,630
But now...

377
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,960
Got it.

378
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,590
I'll get back before nightfall.

379
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,050
Thank you!

380
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,510
A SLEEP SLIME APPEARED

381
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,430
Ow! Wait...

382
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,220
It didn't hurt at all.

383
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:03,770
I see!

384
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,060
So this is what S rank HP feels like.

385
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,910
It really dropped a carrot!

386
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,450
That's huge.

387
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,840
It's smaller than mine?

388
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,420
What are you standing there for?

389
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:38,130
B2 is too hard for a newbie,
don't you think?

390
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:39,840
Let me check his status.

391
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,390
Easy scan.

392
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,680
Level 1.

393
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:50,600
If you don't want to die,
you better get back to B1.

394
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,690
What's the deal with them?

395
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,200
Those ears...

396
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,490
Are those reals?

397
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,950
Level 1.

398
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,210
What? You're talking about me?

399
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,580
Well, yeah, I am.

400
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,130
I hate low-levels.

401
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,710
What?

402
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,720
What's wrong with her?!

403
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,680
Big carrots!

404
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,890
People at the Swallow’s Returned Favor
loves the carrots.

405
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,100
They gave me 8,000 piro for those.

406
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,480
8,000 piro in one day?

407
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,770
Woah!

408
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,320
In a month, that would be 24,000 piro.

409
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,650
That's a fair bit higher
than my previous salary.

410
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,740
I saved some for us to have.

411
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
I'll make something delicious.

412
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:49,790
Yes?

413
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,580
You're the girl from before!

414
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,540
I hate low-levels.

415
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,710
Then why do you come to my home?

416
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,380
Huh? Do you need something?

417
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,970
I wuvv.
