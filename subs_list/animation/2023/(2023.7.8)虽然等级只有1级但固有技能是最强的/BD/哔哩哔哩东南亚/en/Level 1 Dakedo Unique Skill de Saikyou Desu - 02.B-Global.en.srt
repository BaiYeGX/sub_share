1
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,780
I used to work as a salaryman
for a black company and was reincarnated

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,490
in a strange world where everything

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:11,570
comes from drops in dungeons.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,330
I'm level 1, but with my unique skill,
"Drop Rate All-S,"

5
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,540
my new life has started.

6
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,090
And what I encountered was...

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,920
...a giant gorilla?!

8
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:29,630
Just what kind of rare item
do I get from beating it?!

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,890
Yes?

10
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:34,680
The girl from before...

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:38,640
I hate low levels.

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,810
Uh, was it really necessary
to come to my house for that?

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,480
What? You need something?

14
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,110
I wuv you.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:07,260
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP EVEN AT LEVEL 1

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
IT'S DEAD OR CARROT

17
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,170
Yoda, who is this girl?

18
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,970
Well, I'm not really sure myself.

19
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:37,180
Are bunny girls common in this world?

20
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,390
Huh?

21
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,850
Uh, eh, what?

22
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,810
Stop it! We're in your—

23
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,490
I did the same thing to both of you,
and yet the low-level is still alive.

24
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,740
You were trying to do that to me?!

25
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,030
Your level is low, so why?!

26
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,830
W-Well...

27
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,450
It's probably because my HP is S rank.

28
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,750
By the way, what are you here for?

29
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,670
This.

30
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,210
I picked this up in the dungeon.

31
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,730
I want more of this amazing carrot!

32
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,740
Found it!

33
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,410
I wuv carrot!

34
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,000
Wait, that's ours.

35
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,790
Would you like to have this with us?

36
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,880
First, we start by peeling
the skin off the carrot.

37
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,100
Then we slice it into thin strips.

38
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,230
Boil them enough while
it's still nice and crunchy.

39
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,190
Then we fry the carrot leaf
and cook it with meat.

40
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:22,530
Add in the carrot noodles we made,
and we've got tricolor carrot-noodle soup!

41
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,120
Please enjoy it with a bean sprout
and carrot soup.

42
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,840
Let's eat!

43
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,260
The soup smells great.

44
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,010
So those ears are real, huh.

45
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,340
It's very yummy!

46
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,550
It really is.

47
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,850
A goddess!

48
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,850
I know, right?

49
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,190
Emily's cooking is god-level!

50
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,770
That's going a little far!

51
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,150
But I've made a lot.

52
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,690
Eat as much as you like.

53
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,110
Thank you for the food!

54
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,700
Thank you for the food.

55
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,120
Bye.

56
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Eh? Uh, yeah.

57
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,080
Please come by again.

58
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,920
Will surely do.

59
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,670
What's up with her?

60
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,510
Come to think of it,
we didn't ask her name.

61
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:23,970
Yoda.

62
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,100
Thank you.

63
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,720
Huh?

64
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,390
Before coming here,
I always eat alone.

65
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,230
That's why I'm happy to be eating
with you and a visitor.

66
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:39,070
It's a dream come true.

67
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,410
Me too.

68
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,830
I’d been eating alone all the time.

69
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,930
Yoda.

70
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,290
Let's eat together from here on out, too.

71
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,250
Yeah!

72
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,050
NIHONIUM LEVEL 2

73
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:08,180
I've obtained a warm home
to go back to in this world.

74
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:10,930
And to protect that...

75
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,360
...I want to get stronger!

76
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,320
Oh no! My only weapon!

77
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,150
My HP is S rank,
so it didn't hurt at all.

78
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,160
But it's gross!

79
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,300
I want a long range weapon.

80
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,100
B1 drop seeds that increase my HP.

81
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,350
Then B2...

82
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,280
Ryota's max strength increased by 1.

83
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,700
So it's Strength!

84
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,580
What are you doing there?!

85
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,540
What was that?

86
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,420
Huh?

87
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,790
That drop just now.

88
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,170
Well...

89
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
In this Nihonium dungeon
where nothing is supposed to drop,

90
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,180
only someone with S rank drop skill
like me can increase their stats.

91
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,180
If possible, I don't want to tell
anyone about that.

92
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,640
Stare...

93
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,020
Don't say it out loud.

94
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,690
No carrots yet?

95
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,440
That's what you want?!

96
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,940
If I can't have carrots...

97
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,360
I-If you can't?

98
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,280
Dead-or-carrot?

99
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,700
It's a matter of life or death to you?!

100
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,660
No carrot drops here.

101
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,450
Hurry and go to Tellurium.

102
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,200
Fine. I'll go to Tellurium after this.

103
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,540
Really?!

104
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,790
Yeah.

105
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,210
Just wait for me
at Swallow’s Returned Favor.

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,130
Got it!

107
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,380
So as long as she gets her carrots...

108
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,550
...that's all she needs?

109
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,020
Because my Strength
went from F to D,

110
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,350
it is now easier for me
to beat the slimes.

111
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,400
So I get more drops than usual.

112
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,900
There she is.

113
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,660
Who's that guy?

114
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,530
Oh crap, he approached
the Killer Rabbit on his own!

115
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,750
Here, carrot.

116
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,620
Is he even aware of what he's doing?!

117
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,418
What?

118
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,582
I wuv carrot!

119
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,260
A carrot that was even approved
by the carrot junkie?!

120
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,140
Seriously, what the heck is this?

121
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,640
R-Ryota!

122
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,940
Are you friends with her?

123
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,520
Oh, Erza.

124
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,940
Rather than friends... uh...

125
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,900
Here's your food.

126
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,570
- Wov, wov, wov, woooov.
- She just follows me around

127
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,530
- Wov, wov, wov, woooov.
- after I gave her some carrots.

128
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,660
Ryota, let me buy these carrots
for double the price!

129
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,710
Double?! Wh-Why?

130
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,670
Don't you know?

131
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,880
This person is...

132
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,170
Her name is Eve Callusleader.

133
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,010
She's an Adventurer with a trademark
buddy-girl outfit and natural bunny ears.

134
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,640
Rumour had it
that her ultimate technique,

135
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,930
Excalibur, could calve a boulder.

136
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,310
She was also known
by the title of Carrot Sommelier.

137
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,310
There is even a dungeon near Cyclo
with a floor that drop carrots

138
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:46,610
that only she managed to conquer.

139
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,490
Her catchphrase is "dead or carrot."

140
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,160
It is said that some people had died
after giving her bad carrots.

141
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,330
That's a lot of information to process...

142
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,790
If it's a carrot that Eve acknowledges,

143
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,540
its price is bound to go up!

144
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,210
Swallow’s Returned Favor would like
to have it no matter what!

145
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,130
We will take it for fifteen thousand piro!

146
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,850
Fifteen thousand times thirty...

147
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,810
In a month, it'll be four hundred
fifty thousand piro!

148
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,140
I must thank her!

149
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,020
I like carrots more than thanks.

150
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,940
Carrots please.

151
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,530
The door's closed today!

152
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,320
I'm done for the day,
so wait tomorrow, okay?

153
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,990
No! I hate low-level!

154
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,660
Oops.

155
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:43,710
My name is not low-level.
It's Ryota Sato.

156
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,170
What about carrots?

157
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,420
Sorry.

158
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,960
I promised Emily I'd go home on time.

159
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,840
I promise I'll bring you carrots tomorrow.

160
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,800
Dead-or-carrot.

161
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,220
Dead-or-carrot.

162
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,390
Fine.

163
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:02,350
See you tomorrow, Eve.

164
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,780
Carrot tomorrow.

165
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,950
Ca-

166
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,740
-rr-

167
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,120
-o-

168
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,910
-t.

169
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,120
Wuv, wuv, wuv, wuv, wuv.

170
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,450
Carrot!

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,420
TELLURIUM LEVEL 2

172
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,340
Looks like we can get a lot today.

173
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,170
I'll go check over there.

174
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,340
Okay.

175
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,680
There it is!

176
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,760
Got it!

177
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,980
Hang in there.

178
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,530
What are you two doing?!

179
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,490
We're sorry, Captain!

180
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,240
Captain?

181
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,080
He's strong.

182
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:11,460
But...

183
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:15,710
All right. On to the next one.

184
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,880
Sorry.

185
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,930
Let us... rest just a little.

186
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:24,720
We haven't rested
for two whole days now.

187
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:26,930
Feeble!

188
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,940
In my youth,

189
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,190
we'd spend an entire week or two
in a dungeon like this.

190
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,780
That's how I've gotten this strong.

191
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,860
But we haven't got any proper sleep.

192
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,280
I'm doing this for your own good.

193
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,200
Our... own good?

194
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,540
That's right!

195
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,870
You two will become strong someday!

196
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,210
That's because I believe in your potential

197
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,210
so I'm being strict towards you!

198
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,250
Now, will you believe in me?!

199
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,050
Captain...

200
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:00,380
We're sorry.

201
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,970
As long as you understand.

202
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,430
Now, let's go.

203
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,430
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,190
I wished I didn't see that.

205
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,900
I had a boss like him
in the company I worked at before.

206
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,610
He'd push unreasonable tasks on those
under him and say it was for their own good.

207
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,700
So people like them are everywhere.

208
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,370
Yoda?

209
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,790
Is something matter?

210
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,960
You look pale.

211
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,630
It's nothing.

212
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,250
Let's take a break.
I made us lunch.

213
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,510
These look tasty! Thank you!

214
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,730
Emily's lunch!

215
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,520
There she is.

216
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,440
Carrot!

217
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,650
Please eat this with us, Eve.

218
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,070
I tried making a carrot pudding.

219
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,730
Carrot pudding?!

220
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,280
Yummy!

221
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,990
It's tasty!

222
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,280
Goddess!

223
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,910
Oh, this is tasty too.

224
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,830
It smells great, and the breading
is sweet and delicious!

225
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,870
I used sweet potato powder
for the breading.

226
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,000
I also put in a secret spice.

227
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,420
Oooh!

228
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,460
Um, next is...

229
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,340
There is a carrot in this, too.

230
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,930
I'll take that!

231
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,140
Ah, this is great.

232
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,220
I can feel myself being filled with joy.

233
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,560
You two, don't be like them.

234
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,900
It is scandalous to be so slovenly
in a sacred dungeon.

235
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:47,700
Every drop has a soul and our effort
is reflected in the quality of it.

236
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:51,290
Goods produced by such sloths
can never be any good.

237
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,710
Huh?

238
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,000
Eat carrot.

239
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,590
What's this?!

240
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,640
It's tasty!

241
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,850
Hey, what are you doing?!

242
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,680
I hate people who misunderstand carrots.

243
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,350
What?!

244
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,310
Carrots are delicious
regardless of hardship.

245
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:17,310
You little—

246
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,150
Low-level's carrots are the best.

247
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,490
You two, let's go!

248
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,170
I'll have carrot!

249
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,170
Thank you, Eve.

250
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,010
Bring carrot tomorrow.
More carrot.

251
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,020
Yes, of course.

252
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,940
Thank you for bringing so many.

253
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:04,280
We wanted to bring more, actually.

254
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,240
But this is the most we can carry.

255
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,620
I assume you don't have
a magic cart, correct?

256
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,990
Magic cart?

257
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,040
Those things.

258
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,790
With a magic cart, you can carry more drops
and do things more effectively.

259
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,710
Oh, that sounds great.

260
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,180
You're going to buy a magic cart?

261
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,260
Yeah. They sound quite convenient.

262
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,270
Is this the magic cart shop
that Erza mentioned?

263
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,610
Welcome!

264
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,570
Good afternoon.

265
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,860
Um...

266
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,780
Where are your mommy and daddy?

267
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:51,030
Daddy is modifying at the back.

268
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:52,870
Modifying?

269
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,080
Daddy! A customer!

270
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,790
Oh, Olga.
Thank you for watching the shop.

271
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,250
Oh, welcome.

272
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,164
We'd like to buy a magic cart.

273
00:17:06,164 --> 00:17:10,800
Oh, then I've got just the perfect one.

274
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,010
Here's my recommendation!

275
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,720
It comes with a monster detection system.

276
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,836
That sounds convenient!

277
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:18,164
Yes!

278
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:22,980
Of course! I modified it myself,
so I assure you of its quality.

279
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,836
Oh, so that's what she meant.

280
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:28,642
So how much it is?

281
00:17:28,642 --> 00:17:29,900
Ten million piro.

282
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,820
- Ten million?!
- Ten million?!

283
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,700
Oh well, if you want a regular one,
you can get it for around two or three million.

284
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,250
It still cost quite a lot, huh.

285
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,580
The regular ones are boring.

286
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,710
I have one I'm still working at right now.

287
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,710
I plan to put even more
convenient functions on it.

288
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,510
So be sure you wait until it's done!

289
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,420
Sure...

290
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,680
Magic cart...

291
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,760
It's still outside of our reach right now,

292
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,720
but let's save up and get it someday!

293
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,600
Yes!

294
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,350
Let's get home and have dinner.

295
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,850
I'm sure Eve will barge in again.

296
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,650
I'll make her some carrot dishes.

297
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,980
An outsider is on the loose!

298
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,740
What's an outsider?

299
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,040
It's a monster born from a dungeon
item drop that's left unchecked.

300
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,660
Monster?

301
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,300
A gorilla?!

302
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,980
Even the Adventurers are running away!

303
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:47,610
Outsiders don't drop any items.

304
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,900
It's not worth the effort,
so nobody wants to deal with it.

305
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,030
Huh?!

306
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,110
But still...!

307
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,820
Daddy, I'm scared!

308
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,280
It'll be fine, Olga.

309
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,410
You two should hurry up
and run away, too!

310
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:16,090
R-Ryota?!

311
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,390
I can't hold it for long!

312
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:23,770
Low-level, get lost!

313
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,030
Thank you very much.

314
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,280
Are you okay, Erza?

315
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,200
Yes.

316
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,570
But...

317
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,000
Our town...

318
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,840
I'll go defeat the outsider.

319
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,840
It will be okay.

320
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,590
I won't let that thing destroy our city!

321
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,390
I'm coming with you!

322
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,150
We can't hit it properly like this!

323
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,480
I'll do it!

324
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,110
You guys keep it steady!

325
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,360
Huh?! What the heck
are you saying?!

326
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,280
Reckless.

327
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,530
You better know
what you're doing, low-level!

328
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,160
Just shut up and leave it to me!

329
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,500
There!

330
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,960
Thanks, Emily!

331
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,170
Eve!

332
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,220
Thank you!

333
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:49,690
Yoda!

334
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,070
Don't you mess with me and my skill!

335
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,500
It's... over.

336
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,040
Yes, it is!

337
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,370
What a cheeky low-level.

338
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,760
We're all saved thanks to you.

339
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,260
Thank you!

340
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,590
Ryota!

341
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:25,850
Thank you so much for protecting Cyclo.

342
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,060
I've never been appreciated
for what I'm doing.

343
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,360
And I've never done anything
directly for someone else.

344
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,820
But...

345
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,570
In this world, it's...

346
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,820
That sound just now.

347
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,320
What's the matter?

348
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,240
Emily, an outsider doesn't
drop anything, right?

349
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,700
Yes.

350
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,460
But that sound just now...

351
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,460
I had things drop in Nihonium
when everyone else don't.

352
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,630
Is it true for that gorilla, too?

353
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,970
This is...!
