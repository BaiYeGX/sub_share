1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,240
I worked as a salaryman
for a toxic company,

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,050
until I reincarnated...

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,150
in a crazy world where everything is
dropped by monsters in dungeons.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,390
In my new life, I'm level 1,
but I have a unique skill

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:18,620
that puts all of my drop rates at rank S.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,880
And today I'm...

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,000
being hugged by a mummy,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,470
hassled by a hot guy,

9
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,320
and swarmed by bugs!

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,910
Wait, none of that is any good at all!

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:45,280
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
EVEN AT LEVEL 1

12
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,020
YAY! IT'S MY TURN NOW

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,680
It's coming along great!

14
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,210
I'm enjoying my life very much.

15
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,830
Are you watching?

16
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,550
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1

17
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,250
First skeletons, then zombies,
and now mummies?

18
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,770
That one sure was tough, though.

19
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,810
My bullets... Oh.

20
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:54,190
RYOTA'S SPEED INCREASED BY 1
Ryota's speed increased by one.

21
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,550
Speed, huh?

22
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,970
Hey! Get off me!

23
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,680
Oh, right. Since my strength's at S...

24
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,740
Looks like I'm better off
using these here.

25
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,850
WILL, SPEED, DEXTERITY

26
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,250
Hi.

27
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:34,070
You're Sato Ryota, right?

28
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,370
Who're you?

29
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,570
Oh, sorry. I'm—

30
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,110
Is this the guy, Nep?

31
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,600
Yep, seems to be.

32
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,860
Huh... So this is him.

33
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,660
Just who is this guy?

34
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,680
Good-looking,
with a cute girl on each arm...

35
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,120
And... what did you want from me?

36
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,730
I wanted to arm wrestle you.

37
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,310
Huh? Why arm wrestle?

38
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm interested in your power.

39
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,260
I've heard...

40
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,250
that you put on quite
the show here recently.

41
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,649
Oh...

42
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,580
What do you say to a match with me?

43
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,170
He's hot, he has cute girls
hanging on him, and he's confident?!

44
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,120
Hang on! I can't just let this guy slide!

45
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,340
All right. Let's do it.

46
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,780
Thanks.

47
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,050
Well, shall we?

48
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,510
Sure.

49
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,130
Ready...

50
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,930
Go!

51
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,460
This guy's... strong!

52
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:06,830
- No way! Neptune lost?

53
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,370
- What?!
- No way! Neptune lost?

54
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,360
- Nep actually lost?
- No way! Neptune lost?

55
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,100
You're really something!

56
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,450
Yeah, same to you.

57
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,510
Oh, that's right!
He's...

58
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,640
Neptune?

59
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,240
You don't know them?

60
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,110
They're the most powerful
organization in Secro.

61
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,630
Neptune?

62
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,400
Hey.

63
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,900
Want to go one more round?

64
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,660
No, thanks.

65
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,320
We've made enough
of a scene already.

66
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,490
Aw...

67
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,320
Well, so it goes.
In that case...

68
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,840
Hey! What were you thinking?!

69
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,220
Wow, you're not half bad!

70
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,180
Yeah. I like you.

71
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,020
Would you be interested
in joining our family?

72
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,220
What?

73
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,060
For real?

74
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,480
Did he get scouted
by the Neptune family?

75
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,810
And by the leader himself!

76
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,570
What?! You turned him down?!

77
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,510
Yeah. I have no interest
in belonging to any groups.

78
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,330
I have more fun
just living here with you.

79
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,960
This is where I feel best.

80
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm so happy to hear you say that.

81
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,630
You're very cocky for a low-level.

82
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,450
Wait, you're here?!

83
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,000
It really is amazing that
he scouted you, though!

84
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,020
It must be because you've
helped so many people.

85
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,650
You're a hero, Yoda!

86
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,490
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1

87
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,840
A hero? I'm a hero, huh?

88
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,570
Hey, we meet again.

89
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,370
Oh... huh?

90
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,310
Are those boxes...

91
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,750
Oh, you saw these?

92
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,160
This is our company's latest product,
the Pandora's Box!

93
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,840
Pandora's Box?

94
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,950
Yes, and you came
at the right time. Look.

95
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,100
It automatically sucks up dropped items,

96
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,090
and even displays the face of
the person who found them!

97
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,380
There are a few folks
who don't believe our air

98
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,220
was really harvested by the princess.

99
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,080
We came up with these to fix that.

100
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,750
You're an adventurer, aren't you?

101
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,770
I'll give you a few. Use them well.

102
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,620
And tell your friends about them!

103
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,340
Uh, I don't know if I need this many...

104
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,490
Wait, if they automatically
suck up all dropped items...

105
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,490
I was right!

106
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,070
If I use this, I can take
the seeds outside the dungeon!

107
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,900
And if I can take them out...

108
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:39,830
I went through hell to get freezing bullets,
and this makes it so easy!

109
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,580
No...

110
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,140
Hang on.

111
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,720
NIHONIUM LEVEL 1

112
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,940
If I have this box...

113
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,810
Yoda?

114
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,400
Oh, Emily.

115
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,300
Um, what are you doing?

116
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,320
Here they come!

117
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,330
What?!

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,410
I knew it! It worked!

119
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,450
Yes! There they are!

120
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,780
Ryota acquired a fire bullet.

121
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,200
A fire bullet!
So fire comes after ice!

122
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,130
And what's this one from the mummy?

123
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,310
Um, Yoda?

124
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,550
What just happened?

125
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,530
This is...

126
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,770
I can use these!
I gotta get more!

127
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,670
Check out all these special bullets!

128
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,230
Amazing!

129
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,370
All right, now for the last—

130
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,560
What's wrong?

131
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,380
I just felt a really powerful chill...

132
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,710
A chill?

133
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,760
Oh! I forgot! That's what
I came to tell you!

134
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,630
Huh?

135
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yoda, a magic storm is coming!

136
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,560
A magic storm?

137
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,390
Um... is Emily not with you today?

138
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:32,780
O-Oh... She had some shopping to do,

139
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,740
so we're working separately today.

140
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,910
I-I see. It is a magic storm, after all.

141
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,370
Does a magic storm have anything
to do with shopping?

142
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:46,670
Y-Yes, I think it does.

143
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:51,300
Are you telling me you don't know
what a magic storm is?

144
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:55,720
Yeah, actually...
Emily mentioned it to me,

145
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,250
but she didn't know much, either.

146
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,860
Could you tell me what they're all about?

147
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,140
Of course! Leave it to me!

148
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,990
A magic storm is a very
rare natural phenomenon.

149
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,140
When they occur,
no one can use any magic at all.

150
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,470
You can't use magic?

151
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,520
Right. And depending on how big they are,
their effects can go beyond the town.

152
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,010
You might not be able to use
magic in dungeons, either.

153
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,890
Not even in dungeons?

154
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,450
And this magic storm is a big one
that will affect dungeons, too.

155
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,550
So all those who use magic
are taking the day off.

156
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,080
That leads to reduced availability of drops
from dungeons intended for them,

157
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,510
which affects how people shop.

158
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,580
I see.

159
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,550
Someone help! Please!

160
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,650
Help!

161
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,350
Rosa...

162
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,090
My partner's been
left behind in Silicon!

163
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:02,990
Reyes!

164
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,500
What's Silicon?

165
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:09,250
One of the dungeons intended
for magic users.

166
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,810
- What? Weren't all magic users

167
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,210
- Please help me! I beg you!
- What? Weren't all magic users

168
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,250
- Please help me! I beg you!
- taking the day off?

169
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,100
- Please help me! I beg you!
- Reyes and Rosa just came to Secro recently.

170
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:19,180
I think they must have found out
about the magic storm too late.

171
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,230
Hey, why won't anyone...

172
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,040
Tragic, isn't it?

173
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,860
Don't show up out of nowhere!
Why are you here, anyway?!

174
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,490
I thought maybe you'd
changed your mind.

175
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,700
I have not!

176
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,260
Well, that's a shame.

177
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,670
Still...

178
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,200
Of all places, it had to be Silicon...

179
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,470
What do you mean?

180
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,990
The monsters there are a real pain.

181
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,040
Even I don't want to go near it.

182
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,800
Even you?

183
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,210
The monsters in Silicon take nearly
no damage from non-magical attacks.

184
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,710
So they have my condolences,

185
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,320
but I can't put my life on the line
for a complete stranger.

186
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,100
You're a hero, Yoda!

187
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,000
Please... Somebody help me... Please...

188
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,740
Hey.

189
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,780
I'll go.

190
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,340
Tell me what's going on.

191
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,160
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
EVEN AT LEVEL 1

192
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,060
It was me, Eyna!

193
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,830
MY UNIQUE SKILL MAKES ME OP
Whatcha doing, Erza?

194
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,100
EVEN AT LEVEL 1
It smells like Ryota...

195
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,050
Please use it responsibly.

196
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,890
SILICON LEVEL 1

197
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:53,030
Level 3.
That's where Rosa should be.

198
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,260
That's a fire bullet!

199
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,740
All right!

200
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,680
That should stop it
from turning into a stray.

201
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,220
I can still use my special bullets
during the magic storm.

202
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,300
This'll work!

203
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,470
I can save her!

204
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,460
There are so many of them.

205
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,840
But...

206
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,520
Yoda, sorry to keep you waiting!

207
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,930
Emily!

208
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,000
Yes?

209
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,110
Wait, isn't that Yoda's...

210
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,870
Mr. Sato is in a bit of a situation.

211
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,870
What?! Yoda's in trouble?!

212
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,710
SILICON LEVEL 3

213
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,810
This is the place.

214
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,040
Already?!

215
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,690
Rosa! Where are you?!

216
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,110
Rosa!

217
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,010
This looks bad.

218
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,300
Hang tight! I'll—

219
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,370
This is not the time!

220
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,970
Are you kidding me?!

221
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,800
My special bullets...

222
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,130
Hey! Silicon is that way!

223
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,720
Don't go there!
It's dangerous!

224
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,820
I'm afraid we have no choice!

225
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,550
I get it.

226
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,470
Low-Level's carrots are important.

227
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,890
No, that's not exactly why...

228
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,430
Why, then?

229
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,740
Because Yoda reminds me of...

230
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,620
my mother!

231
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,770
That was amazing, Mom!

232
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,210
Well, that's how I handle things.

233
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,920
Are you guys okay?

234
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,690
Y-Yeah...

235
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,620
You need to understand what you're
capable of before taking on a dungeon.

236
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,050
Otherwise, you don't stand a chance.

237
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,320
Yes, ma'am...

238
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,340
Okay, that's enough lecturing for now.

239
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,700
Time to live it up! Yeah?

240
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,260
If she ever found someone in trouble,

241
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,080
she'd help them, lecture them,
and then have fun with them.

242
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,260
My mother was both strong and kind.

243
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,370
But one day...

244
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,080
What's wrong?

245
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,540
You'd better run, too!

246
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,360
There's a dragon! It's a stray!

247
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,670
Mom?

248
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,050
Don't worry.
Everything's fine, Emily.

249
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:15,859
I'll take care of this.
You escape with the others.

250
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,300
All right?

251
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,670
O-Okay...

252
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:31,150
Mom!

253
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,490
Mom!

254
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,120
Don't make a fuss.

255
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,590
Are the others safe?

256
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:43,080
They're all fine!

257
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,070
Oh?

258
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,260
I'm glad.

259
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,860
Don't cry.
The time for that will come later.

260
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,030
Huh?

261
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,330
Take me out of here.
Get me to the others.

262
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,170
That way, none of my belongings
will turn into strays.

263
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,140
Can you do that?

264
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,230
Yes.

265
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,350
Will you continue going
into dungeons after this?

266
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,700
Don't be reckless.

267
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,650
Not just for yourself...
but for everyone...

268
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:35,990
She was concerned for
everyone else right up to the end.

269
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,040
My mother was a hero.

270
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,550
Yoda is the same way!

271
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,370
He's done so much
to help so many people.

272
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,480
So now it's my turn to help him!

273
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,680
Regular bullets just aren't cutting it!

274
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,500
Yoda!

275
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,370
Emily?! Wait...

276
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,440
What?! Why are there zombies?!

277
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,910
We'll take care of her!
You handle the strays!

278
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:40,620
We brought more bullets for you!

279
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,960
You're both lifesavers, Emily, Eve!

280
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,930
I'll take it from here!

281
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,690
Rosa!

282
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,460
She's hurt badly...

283
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,700
And I can't use healing magic during
the magic storm! What do I do?

284
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,700
No need to worry about that.

285
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,730
Huh?

286
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,860
What was that?

287
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,130
A healing bullet.

288
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,300
Ryota acquired a healing bullet.

289
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,650
This is...

290
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,060
I didn't have time
to use it in the dungeon.

291
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,610
Rosa!

292
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,900
Thank you! Thank you so much!

293
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,700
I'm glad we were able to save her.

294
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,220
By the way, Emily, I'm impressed
you had the idea to do that.

295
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,110
It wasn't a big deal.

296
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,910
I just imitated what I've seen you do.

297
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,680
You really saved my skin.

298
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,010
Thanks, Emily.
And you, too, Eve.

299
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,990
Carrots before thanks.

300
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,120
Okay, want to get something
to eat before we go home?

301
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,880
You all must be tired.

302
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,660
We should head back home, then.

303
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,040
Huh? But that'll mean you have to cook.

304
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,460
That's exactly why!

305
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,080
Huh?

306
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,290
Huh?

307
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,470
I'm enjoying my life very much.

308
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,590
Are you watching, Mom?
