Oh... Thank you.

00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,207
Are you feeling unwell?

51
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:55,628
No, it's nothing like that.
I'm just a little...

00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,056
<i>I treated the wound, but still...</i>

57
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,936
<i>Guns?! She got shot by a gun!</i>

58
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,899
Mother. Are you going to die?

59
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,486
Don't worry, Anya. I won't die.

60
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:25,658
I'm a little tired,
so I'll head to bed now.

61

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,636
<i>Yor was in a bad mood.
Was it because I asked her to go shopping?</i>

64
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,306
<i>That must be it!
This marriage is just on paper,</i>

65
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,560
<i>but I've been asking her to do so much!
That must've made her unhappy!</i>

66
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,231
<i>Mother won't die even when she gets
shot by a gun! Impressive!</i>

67
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:01,486
<i>This is not good! Not good at all!
Family troubles will ruin this mission!</i>

68
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,946
<i>I must do everything within my power

<i>Hopefully she'll feel better

00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,674
<i>- It's not better.

72
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,843
Good morning.

73
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,846
Good morning.

74
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:30,973
<i>It hurts.</i>

75
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,851
<i>I need to do something to lift her mood.</i>

76
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,479
Yor, today is our day off.

77
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,484
- So, will you go out on a date with me?
- Date...

78
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:46,572
You're always helping me by taking care
of the house and looking after Anya.

79
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,991
So I want you to relax
and let loose today.

80
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,493
A date...

81
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:55,123
My boyfriend took me on a cruise
for our date the other day.

82
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,376
What kind of dates do you go on, Yor?

83
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,462
- We've never gone on a date.
- Liar.

84
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,298
It's normal to go on dates
even after you get married.

85
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,426
Oh... well...

86
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,473
<i>I should probably gain
some experience of going on a date,</i>

87
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,726
<i>or people might suspect
that we're not really a married couple.</i>

88
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:20,189
We don't have to go
if you're not feeling well.

89
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,818
I will go!

90
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,280
This is a great opportunity,
so I will use this chance to learn!

91
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,656
Learn?

92
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,076
I'll get dressed right away!

93
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,288
Anya wants to go too! A date!
How exciting!

94
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,709
Sorry. You're not coming with us.
It's a date, after all.

95
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,254
How sad.

96
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,931
Have fun at home.

97
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,434
Come here.

98
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,231
Listen up!
How many times do I have to tell you?

99
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,485
I'm your informant!
Not someone you call for odd jobs!

100
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:09,614
I have no choice. I can't leave Anya
home all by herself.

101
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,534
This is an important part of the mission
to keep the family together.

102
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,621
You said you want to invent
some new spying gadgets, right?

103
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,581
This payment will help with that.

104
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,792
You keep on using my weakness against me!

105
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,922
All right. Shall we go, Yor?

106
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,139
Your hand, please.

107
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,061
<i>Last night, I came up with 862 date plans</i>

108
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,647
<i>that Yor might enjoy.</i>

109
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,564
<i>I'm all set.</i>

110
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,405
I'm sorry, Loid.

111
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,535
<i>I'll sustain more damage to my butt
if I have to sit!</i>

112
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,579
I'd like to walk on our date.

113
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,499
<i>She's mad? She's still mad?</i>

114
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,586
<i>Dammit. That takes out 794 date plans.</i>

115
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,214
Good idea.

116
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,591
Let's just take it easy
and go for a stroll.

117
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,430
I'm worried about Father and Mother.

118
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,518
That guy's hopeless if he's got
a little kid worrying about him.

119
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:23,354
Little kids should go inside
and watch anime.

120
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:29,110
{\an8}Go, Bondman! Tail the target,
and maintain world peace!

121
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,903
Scruffy!

122
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,117
Anya wants to tail Father and Mother.

123
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,126
What? That sounds like so much fun!

124
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,253
- Shall we do it?
- Let's tail them!

125
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,172
Your dad is pretty sharp.

126
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,259
So let's disguise ourselves,
and be careful. Go change!

127
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,385
Yes, sir!

128
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,478
That outfit makes you stand out even more.

129
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,273
- No problem.
- If you say so.

<i>What's so fun about that?</i>

142
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,941
<i>I'll view this as part of my mission
to maintain a happy family,</i>

143
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,902
<i>and pretend I don't notice them.</i>

144
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,489
<i>And Anya should be safe as long as Franky
is with her.</i>

145
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:00,117
- Loid?
- Oh, it's nothing.

146
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,536
<i>More importantly,
I have to lift Yor's mood.</i>

147
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,581
{\an8}Shall we do some shopping?

Yor, you have a nice figure,
so I bet you'll look good in pants too.

150
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,549
Would you like to try it on?

151
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,391
<i>If I wear anything that tight,</i>

152
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:26,519
<i>it'll put pressure on my wound,
and the pain will make me faint.</i>

153
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,561
Not a chance.

154
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,481
Sorry.

00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:46,348
<i>Not only have I not lifted her mood,
I've made it worse!</i>

173
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,517
<i>Did I pick all the wrong choices?</i>

174
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,770
<i>What is it? What does Yor like?
Did I not do enough research?</i>

175
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,234
Loid is always acting so cool,
but he's failing so badly!

176
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,278
How pathetic!

177
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,405
Scruffy, are you a mean person?

178
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:06,076
Not at all! I have the right to sneer
because I can't get any girls!

179
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,621
- How pitiful.
- What did you say?!

180
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,290
<i>They're so obtrusive.</i>

181
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,959
I'm sure you're tired. How about dinner?

182
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:14,877
Sure.

183
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,550
Mr. Forger, we have your reservation.

184
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,932
Please sit.

185
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,156
We're very sorry, sir.

186
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,575
We do not serve customers

187
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,411
in casual clothes, nor children.

188
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,331
- No one under the age of 18.
- You heard the man.

189
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,166
Let's give up.

190
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,756
Let's head back soon.

191
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,510
I was getting a little bored anyway.

192
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,849
<i>Thorn Princess? Why is she here?</i>

193
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,435
What is it?

194
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,854
Are you looking for a bathroom?

195
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,358
<i>No doubt about it!</i>

196
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,069
That hurts!

197
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:25,865
<i>She's the assassin that raided
our hideout yesterday!</i>

198
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,825
<i>What is she doing here?</i>

199
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,912
<i>I felt God's mercy as the lone survivor
of that horrendous event,</i>

200
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,414
<i>and that made me want to</i>

201
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,334
<i>straighten out my life, and work hard
for the sake of my girlfriend!</i>

202
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,132
<i>But I see, this is a command
from my friends in hell.</i>

203
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,261
<i>You guys want me to kill her, right?
I'll avenge the Red Circus!</i>

204
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,138
<i>There's a bad guy in the restaurant!</i>

205
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,723
Die, Thorn Princess!

206
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:53,642
Whoa, you're the great assassin after all!
You win!

207
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,312
Yor, you're an assassin?

208
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,231
Let's split. No more Forger family.
We'll dump Anya too.

209
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,151
- Let's go, little one.
- No!

210
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,194
What? You still want to continue this?

211
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,196
My family's in trouble!

212
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,156
What?

213
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,699
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

214
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:11,410
<i>Is this kid worried that her parents
might divorce?</i>

215
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,787
<i>She's so invested,
even though they're a fake family.</i>

216
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,876
I guess I have no choice.
I'll help you out for a little longer.

217
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,880
- Now it's time to play "infiltration."
- Infiltration!

218
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,925
What would you like as your aperitif?

219
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,844
I'll have a dry champagne.

220
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,889
I'll just have a cocktail.

221
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,224
This restaurant serves

222
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,936
a rare pufferfish dish
that comes from the Far East.

223
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,854
It's part of the meal today.

224
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,357
Oh, I see.

225
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,319
<i>Pufferfish is a fish that carries
a toxic poison,</i>

226
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,987
<i>but its flesh is delicious.</i>

227
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,371
Excuse me, please take this to
the lady at table three.

228
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,748
- Okay.
<i>- Gulp down that pufferfish poison.</i>

229
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,584
<i>And go to hell, Thorn Princess!</i>

230
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,920
Hurry up, Scruffy!

231
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,090
Don't rush.
Infiltration requires patience.

232
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,300
If you make a fuss, you'll get caught.

233
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,303
Thank you for waiting.

234
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:20,062
Wow, what a surprising color and aroma.

235
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,772
<i>It's so thick.</i>

236
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:25,275
<i>You can't drink it, Mother!</i>

237
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,083
<i>Oh... I feel...</i>

238
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,087
<i>I successfully avenged all of you,
my friends.</i>

239
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:50,259
<i>The pain in my butt is gone now,
and I feel so much better!</i>

240
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,512
<i>The woman had a high tolerance for poison.</i>

241
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,599
<i>My body feels a little tingly,
but I can sit down!</i>

242
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:02,604
I'm so hungry now.
I can't wait to try the dishes.

243
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,606
Oh... yes.

244
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,610
<i>She's in a good mood now.
Is it because of the alcohol?</i>

245
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,365
<i>What? Wait... I gave her the blood... What?</i>

246
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,283
{\an8}PUFFERFISH POISON IS DANGEROUS.
DON'T TRY IT.

247
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,368
{\an8}<i>There's a fine line between
poison and medicine.</i>

248
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,622
{\an8}<i>Normal people must follow directions,
and the recommended dosages.</i>

249
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,626
What's wrong?

250
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,467
<i>I'll have to resort to extreme measures.</i>

251
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,635
<i>I'll personally kill and bury her!</i>

252
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,639
<i>I can make an improvised bomb
with the tools in the storeroom.</i>

253
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,850
{\an8}<i>I'll use that, that, and that.</i>

254
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,894
{\an8}<i>I can't place a timing device,</i>

255
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,646
{\an8}<i>so I'll have to carry it there myself.</i>

256
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,650
<i>I'm sorry, Catherine.
Please forgive this fool.</i>

257
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,654
We're almost right above the dining area.

258
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,742
Once we're right above them,
I'll lower you with a wire,

259
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,453
so that you can hear their conversation... Wait...

260
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:05,793
<i>I should be able to make the bomb casing,
by using *** and ***.</i>

261
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,795
<i>I think it was placed on the right shelf.</i>

262
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,672
<i>After I put in the blue ♪
located across the shelf,</i>

263
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,467
<i>I'll *** it. I'll also have to</i>

264
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,302
<i>add ***, to make it extra lethal.</i>

265
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,678
<i>Yup, I can do it!</i>

266
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,357
What the hell is this?

267
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,861
Olive oil? Who the hell dropped this here?

268
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,864
Dammit. I don't have time for this!

269
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,082
Who the hell is setting up these pranks?

270
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,003
<i>This is the perfect container
to place the bomb in.</i>

271
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,383
<i>No, this is a little too small.</i>

272
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:58,220
Wait, is this...

273
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:14,278
Why was there an actual bomb in here?

274
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,530
And what is this? Peanuts?

275
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,907
Peanut bomb?

276
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,536
<i>Don't tell me...</i>

277
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,708
<i>Is this Thorn Princess's crony?</i>

278
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,670
<i>A child?</i>

279
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,048
Red Circus guy.

280
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,092
<i>She knows who I am!</i>

281
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,053
From now on, don't ever come near Anya--

282
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,056
I mean, us, ever again.

283
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,684
Got it? This is your last chance.

284
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:51,148
You should quit this bad guy business

285
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,069
and make Catherine happy.

286
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,906
<i>She knows about Catherine too!</i>

287
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,742
<i>She knows everything.</i>

288
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,203
<i>Thorn Princess cannot be underestimated.</i>

289
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,290
<i>She even has a talented child like that
working for her.</i>

290
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:13,086
<i>She's on a completely different level.
I'm no match for her.</i>

291
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,673
<i>I'll forget everything
and live a normal life.</i>

292
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,802
That restaurant was rather hectic,
wasn't it?

293
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,263
But it was delicious!

294
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,765
It sure was.

295
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:28,060
<i>What a relief.
She seems to be in a better mood now.</i>

296
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,896
<i>There's peace once again
in the Forger household.</i>

297
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,569
<i>It's all thanks to Anya.</i>

298
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,906
Where did you run off to a while ago?

299
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,876
Thank you very much, Loid.

300
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:58,257
Ever since I was young, I had to work
and take care of my younger brother,

301
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,300
so I never had time to have fun.

302
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,097
That's why

303
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,017
I really enjoyed myself today.

304
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,188
Please invite me out again.

305
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,899
<i>When I'm not injured.</i>

306
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,153
It'd be my pleasure.

307
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,871
Look at that! It's a fairground!

308
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,915
Should we stop by?

309
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,252
Father! Anya wants to ride
the Ferris wheel!

310
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,713
- A fairground!
- Hey, stop that!

311
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,923
Are we not tailing them anymore?

312
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,936
<i>Why?</i>

313
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,606
{\an8}<i>The medicine, or poison in this case,
wore off.</i>

314
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,277
<i>I don't understand women.</i>
