{\an8}ORIGINAL WORK BY TATSUYA ENDO
SERIALIZED ON SHUEISHA'S SHONEN JUMP PLUS

00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,929
{\an8}MISSION:35
PART A: ENJOY THE RESORT TO THE FULLEST

3
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,874
Resort island!

4
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,877
Super landing!

5
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,255
Don't jump, you'll trip.

6
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:21,724
<i>I'm glad the State Security Service
is on guard searching for the bomber,</i>

7
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,228
<i>but I feel their eyes roving about,
and it's unnerving.</i>

8
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,521
Father.

9
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,649
Usually, at times like this,
a father would

10
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:33,653
jump, skip, and get excited with
his daughter. Or so I've heard.

11
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,532
Let's enjoy the resort island!

12
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,616
<i>Father is so simple.</i>

13
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,584
- Mother!
- Yor!

14
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:51,004
- Mother!
- You got our message?

15
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,297
Yes.

16
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,591
They gave me a day off today.

17
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,513
- Is your face a little swollen?
<i>- Oh crap. He noticed.</i>

18
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,267
- Are you okay?
- Oh... ah... well...

19
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,520
Our possible client
got in a fight with his wife,

20
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,106
and I got a little hurt
when I stepped in to break it up.

21
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,985
I see. Then what about the attempt
to attract them to our city?

22
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,112
That fell through.

23
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:20,074
But we did all we could.

24
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,744
And in the end, they were both smiling.

25
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,370
So I'm satisfied.

26
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,122
I see.

27
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,375
Can you play with us today, Mother?

28
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,878
Yes, let's have lots of fun!

29
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,632
- Let's enjoy!
- Let's enjoy ourselves!

30
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,603
They look like Bond!

31
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,817
- It's so nice and peaceful.
- It sure is.

32
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,778
<i>Although the situation on board
was pretty threatening.</i>

33
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,206
I hope this peace

34
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:35,543
goes on and on forever.

35
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:42,341
<i>In order to make that happen, I will...</i>

36
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,306
Father! Mother!

37
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,310
I want to dive in the water
and look at the fish!

38
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,730
What? That will require us to
wear swimsuits, right?

39
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,065
<i>Oh crap.</i>

40
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,817
<i>I can't let them see the wound
on my chest.</i>

41
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:04,822
Oh never mind. I don't want to get
eaten by sharks.

42
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,866
Oh, but...

43
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:11,287
<i>I can probably hide my wound
if I wear these swimwear!</i>

44
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:14,707
Let's try it, Anya!

45
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,668
Don't worry. There won't be any sharks.

46
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,797
<i>Even if there is, I'll quietly
take them all down.</i>

47
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,486
{\an8}THE FISH ARE BEAUTIFUL!

48
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,573
{\an8}YES, THEY LOOK DELICIOUS.

49
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,206
- I want to try surfing next!
- Let's do it!

50
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,709
- There's a big wave coming, Anya!
- Yes.

51
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,671
Ready? Go for it!

52
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:06,217
<i>Oh crap! I've been working for days,
so I forgot to control my strength!</i>

53
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,481
Anya, are you all right?

54
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,193
{\an8}I want to do it again! Again!
It's so thrilling!

55
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,820
You better not.

56
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:28,489
I'm so sorry!

57
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:36,497
{\an8}- We did so many fun things!
- We sure did.

58
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,544
It's almost time to return to the ship.

59
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,503
You're right.

60
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,391
<i>I was fighting without sleep or rest,
so I'm suddenly getting sleepy...</i>

61
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,021
Hey... Yor.

62
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,818
Father, Anya is sleepy and tired too.

63
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,790
<i>I can understand Anya, but Yor too?</i>

64
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:23,794
<i>I guess her job was really exhausting.</i>

65
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,758
<i>But she still spent all day with Anya
to make her happy.</i>

66
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,351
<i>Thanks for your hard work.</i>

67
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,802
{\an8}SOUVENIR

68
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,063
<i>Regarding the incident on Lorelei,</i>

69
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:11,235
nothing has been made public, but a large
number of passengers are missing.

70
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,946
They were all passengers with fake IDs.

71
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,950
Well, I did notice numerous
suspicious individuals on board.

72
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,330
We'll have to be on guard if they're
trying to wage war between East and West.

73
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,334
The State Security Service believes
that a third country is involved.

74
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,461
They'll most likely

75
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,339
attempt a cover-up of this incident
in order to save face.

76
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,965
As for us,

77
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,594
we should look out for any
extremist groups in Ostania that may

78
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,720
yet be unknown.

79
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,724
It'll affect Operation Strix as well,
so I'm counting on you.

80
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,225
Understood.

81
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:47,563
And aside from the bomb fiasco,

82
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,191
how was your vacation?

83
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,984
Was Anya very happy?

84
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:55,988
I've had enough. It was a lot more
exhausting than a mission.

85
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:03,996
I can't really tell if he's clever
or clumsy.

86
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:22,890
MISSION:35
PART B: BRAGGING ABOUT VACATION

87
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,394
<i>Good morning.</i>

88
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,022
Yor, you're back already?

89
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,025
I still can't believe it, Yor.

90
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,528
It's so unfair that you got to go.

91
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,780
Where's our gift from your cruise trip?

92
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,949
It was work, remember?

93
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:44,286
Well, I found some lovely gifts
on the ship.

94
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,872
Here it is.

95
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:49,959
{\an8}SOUVENIR

96
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,336
{\an8}What is this?

97
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,797
{\an8}It's a skeleton model keychain.

98
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,133
{\an8}Ugh, this is awful.

99
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,427
{\an8}I really don't want this.

100
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,637
What kind of taste do you have?

101
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,266
Usually, souvenirs for coworkers
are things like wines or snacks.

102
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,519
It's usually something they can consume.

103
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,729
Oh, is that right?

104
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:16,944
Father wouldn't buy this for me.
Buy it for me, Mother.

105
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,238
<i>I said that I'll buy it for you.</i>

106
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,492
It's so cool, Anya!

107
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,454
I'll buy these as gifts for Camilla
and the rest.

108
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,957
<i>Oh no, what should I do?</i>

109
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,752
<i>Loid picked out some snacks
as Yuri's gift, but should I give that</i>

110
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,212
<i>to these girls?</i>

111
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,465
<i>But there aren't enough for everyone.</i>

112
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,136
Oh well, I guess it's very Yor.

113
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,473
What? Wine would've definitely
been better.

114
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,479
<i>Maybe I'll give it to my kid.</i>

115
00:12:55,065 --> 00:13:00,779
<i>Skip, skip, tra-la-la</i>

116
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,365
You seem to be in a good mood, Yuri.

117
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,493
Did something good happen
with your sister?

118
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,079
How did you know it was about
my older sister?

119
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,748
Can you read minds?

120
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,875
Maybe.

121
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,254
My sister returned from her business trip.

122
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:21,258
I'm going to stop by to see her
after work.

123
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,638
<i>It's been so long since I saw her.
Sis! Sis!</i>

124
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:29,975
<i>But if Sis is back,
that also means he's back...</i>

125
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,778
The preparation is done.

126
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,032
It's a hassle to do all this
every time her brother comes over.

127
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:50,496
<i>Even though he's family,
he's the secret police, WISE's enemy.</i>

128
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,124
<i>One careless mistake on my part
could ruin everything.</i>

129
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,796
Will it be more convincing if I move
the pillows closer?

130
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,383
I'll add some new family pictures

131
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,469
and prepare some matching pajamas
just in case.

132
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,318
Did you go anywhere during the break?

133
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,321
I went to the art museum to see some of
Pecasso's work.

134
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,449
I saw an orchestra
at the National Opera House.

135
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,909
You're so lucky.

136
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,466
- Good day, Anya.
- Good morning.

137
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,470
You look a little tanned.
Did you go somewhere?

138
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:52,224
You really want to know, Miss?

139
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,273
It's quite a long story, but yes,

140
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,942
Anya was on the sea that day.

141
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,613
That was the beginning
of a never ending adventure.

142
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,239
<i>What character is she playing?</i>

143
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:12,244
I went on board...

144
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,622
- the luxury liner!
- What?

145
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,166
Wow Anya, you're like a celebrity!

146
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,043
Are you serious?

147
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,629
You really went on board
that legendary ship?

148
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:25,382
It's about time you stop looking down
on Anya!

149
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,760
I'm sorry, Miss Anya!

150
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,179
The Forger family is worthy
to visit my house!

151
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,430
Please come!

152
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:38,103
<i>Skilled Agent Anya never forgets
her mission.</i>

153
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,732
I see. So it was just an ordinary break.

154
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,652
It wasn't ordinary at all!
It was super big.

155
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,488
It was some ship called
Princess Lalalalai.

156
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,448
Princess Lorelei?

157
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,117
I went on that before school started.

158
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,495
It was so-so, wasn't it?

159
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,997
I stayed at the Imperial Suite,

160
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:01,001
but their furnishings were nothing
to rave about.

161
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,171
Anya stayed in the third-class prison.

162
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,719
If I had stayed in the third-class cabin
I'd be too embarrassed to talk about it.

163
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,014
Stop it. Have pity on the commoner.

164
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:20,187
I flew over the skies of Münk on
a helicopter the day before yesterday.

165
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,398
It was so much fun.

166
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,942
We stayed at the first-class hotel
in Bayan

167
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,777
and ate lots of good food!

168
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,363
So what?

169
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,948
I asked Papa for a favor,

170
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:34,284
and partied with Rachel,
the actress from <i>Berlint in Love</i>.

171
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,664
There were about 100 guests and I heard
stories behind the drama and got gifts.

172
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,709
I had so much fun.

173
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,919
That's so amazing, Becky!

174
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,755
It's the Blackbell Heavy Industries
after all.

175
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,924
You're on a whole different level.

176
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,427
- Hehe.
- Tell us all about Rachel!

177
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,929
Is she really pretty in person?

178
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,432
Introduce her to me!

179
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:03,188
Anya's ship had about 100
dangerous people on board.

180
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,607
What do you mean by "dangerous people"?

181
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,526
Were there celebrities on board?

182
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:09,194
Who was it?

183
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,241
There were some from foreign countries.

184
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,411
- What?
- Foreign celebrities? That's amazing.

185
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:19,955
Don't keep us in suspense.
Give us some names!

186
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,790
For example,

187
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:25,002
Sickle-and-Chain Barnaby!

188
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,673
<i>Who is that?</i>

189
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,092
Who is that? Never heard of him.

190
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:35,012
- Is it a street performer?
- Who else was there?

191
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,681
Oh... um...

192
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,809
{\an8}The elephant tamer Paon-man.

193
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,645
{\an8}And Shashasha-man who can teleport.

194
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,563
{\an8}LIES

195
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,816
What kind of people are they?
Are they in a circus?

196
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,902
They're... villains.

197
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,990
- Villains?
- Did you run into pirates or something?

198
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,617
How unfortunate for you.

199
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,787
I didn't see any stories like that
on the news.

200
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,371
Don't take it seriously.

201
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,585
<i>That's right! They covered-up
that incident caused by the bad guys.</i>

202
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,879
I wasted my time listening to you.

203
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,549
Tsk, tsk. It's not on the news,

204
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,804
because they are secret villains
that the government

205
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,764
doesn't even know about.

206
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,726
They came up from the bottom of the sea.
Their true identity is...

207
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,895
Octopeople.

208
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,398
Heroic Anya secretly took them down

209
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:30,359
with the stabbing tool...

210
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,276
<i>Mother did.</i>

211
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,279
And what did you talk about with Rachel?

212
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,782
Introduce her to me!

213
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,327
- And world's peace...
- No way!

214
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,371
Samantha was there too?

215
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,748
- You're so lucky.
- I want to see her too!

216
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,000
She has no shame.

217
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,002
She's such a big liar.

218
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,796
It's remarkable, in a way.

219
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,757
I never get tired of watching her.

220
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,093
What's with the elephant taming
Octopeople?

221
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,553
You're absolutely right.

222
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,305
Take your seats everyone.

223
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,810
Did everyone enjoy their break?

224
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:09,523
Teacher, Forger says that she took
down some Octopeople.

225
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,110
Oh, that's impressive.

226
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,457
{\an8}I understand, Anya.

227
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,962
{\an8}Humans have the tendency and urge
to fib in order to impress others.

228
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:33,922
But if you do that,

229
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,758
and try to become the ideal version
of yourself,

230
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,886
you can become a lovely lady.

231
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,971
- That's what Mama told me.
- Becky!

232
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:46,018
But don't lie too much, because if you do,
you'll end up all alone like me.

233
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:59,364
{\an8}Sis! It's been so long!
I haven't seen you in so long, Sis!

234
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,949
{\an8}Here's your souvenir.

235
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,453
{\an8}Yay! I'll treasure it forever.

236
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,663
Eat it before it expires.

237
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,917
Then I'll take a picture of it,
and gaze at it every day.

238
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,543
<i>He's so loud.</i>

239
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,467
- Anya's home.
- Welcome home.

240
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,845
What's wrong, Anya?

241
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,478
You exaggerated and stretched the truth,
and your classmates made fun of you?

242
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,730
They called me a liar.

243
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,316
Anya cried a little.

244
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,485
Why did you lie?

245
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,364
- For Plan B!
- How do you know about that?

246
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,619
I wanted to stand out.

247
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,543
<i>If you let emotions take over, and lie
instinctively, you'll destroy yourself.</i>

248
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,546
<i>If you want to disguise yourself,
do it strategically and thoroughly.</i>

249
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,506
<i>Stake your life.</i>

250
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:01,510
<i>To make your lies convincing,
add in some details,</i>

251
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,845
<i>and sprinkle some truth in it.</i>

252
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,097
<i>But be bold...</i>

253
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,642
Oh I see...

254
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,477
But lying is bad.

255
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:13,021
<i>I've seen many liars.</i>

256
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,565
<i>Humans who lie are all scumbags.</i>

257
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,277
<i>They're scum who are nothing
but pests ruining this country.</i>

258
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,406
<i>Me? I'm lying about my current status
for the sake of Sis.</i>

259
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:25,117
<i>Everything I do for Sis
is in the name of justice.</i>

260
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,287
Yes, liars are all scumbags.

261
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,832
Yes... That's right...

262
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,127
It's best to show your true self,
as much as possible.

263
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,380
That'll help you to get along
with everyone too.

264
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:56,606
Being a liar seems complicated,
so I won't lie anymore.
