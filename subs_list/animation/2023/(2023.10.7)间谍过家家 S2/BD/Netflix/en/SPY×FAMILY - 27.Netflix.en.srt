{\an8}MISSION:27
PART A: BOND'S STRATEGY TO STAY ALIVE

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,008
{\an8}The height of laziness.

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,010
Anya,

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:13,763
finish your homework, or you'll get
scolded by your teacher again.

5
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,265
Okay.

6
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,985
BOND'S SPECIAL ABILITY - PRECOGNITION

7
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,495
Play hide and seek with Anya!

8
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,669
Oh no! It's a blackout!

9
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:55,764
I have a surprise for you, Bond.
Come this way.

10
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,813
I finally found you Subject Number 8!
I'm going to kill you.

11
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:04,981
SCIENTIST

12
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,179
- Bond!
- Don't cry.

13
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,431
He died a happy dog.

14
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,692
What? You want to say a final goodbye?

15
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,913
Anya is busy with homework.
I don't have time to play with you.

16
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,336
Oh no, I'm so sorry, Bond.

17
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:12,382
We're out of dog food,
and I forgot to go buy some.

18
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,718
It seems like Loid won't be back home
until late today,

19
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,848
so I'll make your dinner
with what's available here.

20
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,267
All right! I'll do my best!

21
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,025
Bond, your food is ready.

22
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,951
Bond!

23
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,288
CAUSE OF DEATH

24
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,332
Loid made a list of things
that are bad for dogs,

25
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,585
so I have nothing to worry about!

26
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,131
Your food is ready.

27
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,675
PROBLEM SOLVED!

28
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:59,512
If you make Mother angry,
she'll kill you, so be careful.

29
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,017
Bond!

30
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,770
It's because
he refused to eat the food I made for him.

31
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,028
IT'S ALL OVER NOW

32
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,409
Hey Bond, don't cause a ruckus.

33
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,661
What should I do? Is he sick?

34
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,331
LOID IS NOT HOME

35
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,334
YOR MAKES DINNER

36
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,545
DEAD

37
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,464
LOID COMES HOME EARLY

38
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,467
LOID MAKES DINNER

39
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,054
{\an8}ALIVE

40
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,848
WORK

41
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,059
If it isn't Bond! Why are you here?

42
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,814
Thanks for killing that!
Now I can go home early!

43
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,741
Bond!

44
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,086
It's a doggie!

45
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,307
Thank you!

46
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,852
What's with this stray dog? Shoo!

47
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,232
You ate someone else's food? You bad boy!

48
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,630
It's a dog!
Let's draw eyebrows on his face!

49
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,559
<i>Tonight's mission is to take a sample
of "Gerrulimus," a new truth serum</i>

50
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,062
<i>being developed by Born Industries.</i>

51
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,314
<i>It was a last-minute order,</i>

52
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,775
<i>so I had no time to gather intel.</i>

53
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,109
<i>Go right now!</i>

54
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,570
<i>I can't enter by disguising myself
as someone,</i>

55
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,323
<i>so I'll have no choice but to sneak in.</i>

56
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,326
Bond!

57
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,577
<i>Why is he here?</i>

58
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,538
Be quiet. Or we'll get caught
by the enemy.

59
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,624
You're here by yourself?

60
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,167
Where's Yor and Anya?

61
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,044
Did you leave them
while you were being walked?

62
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,672
I don't know what's going on, but go home.

63
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,508
I'm working right now.

64
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,889
What? You want me to play with you?

65
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,349
I'm busy now. Maybe later.

66
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,436
Stop right now! It's not safe over there!

67
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,526
<i>Is he guiding me on a route
where there are no people?</i>

68
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:43,778
<i>I don't remember training him to do this.</i>

69
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,154
<i>Did he learn this in the past?</i>

70
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,281
<i>Born Industries</i>

71
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,159
<i>was rumored to be involved
with Project Apple.</i>

72
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,412
<i>Did you by any chance,
come here knowing that?</i>

73
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:55,998
Did you come here to avenge yourself,

74
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,584
and your friends who were
used as test subjects?

75
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,419
You...

76
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,591
All right. Let's complete
this mission together.

77
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,761
I lack intel, so it'll be helpful
to rely on your senses.

78
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,697
<i>This is the lab. There are so many vaults.</i>

79
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,868
<i>Which one is the Gerrulimus?</i>

80
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:36,873
<i>Security is tight, so it'll be way
too much work to check each one.</i>

81
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,084
<i>When will I be able to go home?</i>

82
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,007
Why were we called back again?

83
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,593
Apparently, they found a defect.

84
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,761
Oh crap! They came back!

85
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:55,099
I'll hold them back. You go home first.

86
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,726
This will take a long time.

87
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:01,564
Where were you? Eat your food!

88
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,195
Don't worry.

89
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,322
The staff already went home.

90
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,911
Don't tell me...

91
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,498
Seriously, why is the manager

92
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,958
calling us back to the lab?

93
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,377
Apparently, they found a defect.

94
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,214
The deadline was bumped up too.
It's insane.

95
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,634
Stop complaining.
He's being pressured from the bigwigs...

96
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,470
It's unlocked.

97
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:37,767
Hey! What's this?

98
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,772
{\an8}T. Bandit? Who is that?

99
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,524
You've got to be kidding me!

100
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,280
What the hell? It's all right here.

101
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,866
Who the hell tried to trick us...?

102
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,705
Thanks for opening it up for me!

103
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,667
Who the hell are you guys?

104
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,043
Somebody help!

105
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,718
Impressive. Thanks to you,
I completed my mission pretty quickly.

106
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,765
I can go home earlier than I expected.

107
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,646
Is it good?

108
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,361
We were so worried,
and went out looking for you.

109
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:41,330
I see. You're happy you got to
get back at Born Industries, huh?

110
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,665
Good for you.

111
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,126
All right! Let's stop by the supermarket

112
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,794
and I'll make you a feast!

113
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:57,138
MISSION:27
PART B: DAMIAN'S FIELD RESEARCH TRIP

114
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:08,899
Damian, you have to hurry,
or you'll miss roll call.

115
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:17,450
As punishment for missing roll call,
you must help out the Dorm Mother.

116
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,953
You're prohibited from leaving the dorm
until you finish.

117
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,206
This is so unlike you.
Although it's a holiday,

118
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,003
it is not elegant to spend a day in
an unrefined and lazy way, Mr. Desmond.

119
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,212
I'll be more careful.

120
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:39,055
Damian, were you studying
until late again last night?

121
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,766
I have to get my Stella Stars.

122
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,101
You're pushing yourself too hard.

123
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,062
Don't you remember?

124
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,273
Our teacher is
taking us out to watch a movie today!

125
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:52,318
Maybe we can watch the newly released
<i>20,000 Steps under the Sea!</i>

126
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,696
On the way home,
we get to eat roast beef at Wimpsons!

127
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,824
So finish up quickly in order to join us!
Roast beef!

128
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:02,328
I won't be going.
I'm going to be studying in my room.

129
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,705
What? But it's a holiday.

130
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,542
- I already said I'm not going.
- No way.

131
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,544
Teacher!

132
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,505
Can we choose which movie to watch?

133
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,965
Let's watch <i>20,000 Steps under the Sea!</i>

134
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:17,760
Let's see, what should we watch?

135
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:21,514
- We can watch that, right?
<i>- I'm not like those kids.</i>

136
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:25,559
<i>While they're out playing,
I'm going to work hard and climb higher...</i>

137
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:29,730
<i>Damian, continue working hard
so as not to bring shame</i>

138
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,565
<i>upon the Desmond name.</i>

139
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,944
<i>...In order to have Father
praise me once again!</i>

140
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:40,199
Hey kids. Get out of here.

141
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,660
This is his punishment.

142
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,164
{\an8}SNACKS

143
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:04,432
Disheveled clothes,
and eating outside of mealtimes.

144
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,018
As punishment, go help out
the Dorm Mother.

145
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,687
Thank you!

146
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,528
What are you guys doing?
What about the outing?

147
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,406
- We got punished.
- Let's get this over with quickly.

148
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,450
I won't go out to play.

149
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,244
Damian, stop being a grouch.
You study too much!

150
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,247
You guys don't have to stay behind for me.

151
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,208
You two should go have fun.

152
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,887
Now that I think about it, going to
the movies on a nice day like this

153
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,722
lacks good sense.

154
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:47,766
That's right. Doing laundry
is all the rage right now.

155
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,018
And look!

156
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,940
We can pretend we're Imperial Scholars!

157
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,445
Come and get me if you want a Stella Star!

158
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,448
Hold up! That's my cloak!

159
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,951
Stop it you guys! Get to work!

160
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:10,206
<i>How elegant.
Their friendship is preciously elegant.</i>

161
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,971
You look as if you want to go
on a picnic, young man.

162
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,306
No, I don't want to go.

163
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:33,020
Chatting, and fooling around
while doing chores, eh?

164
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,981
- I am giving you all another punishment.
- What?

165
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,901
Go on a field research trip
with Mr. Green,

166
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,736
the school custos.

167
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,576
A picnic sure is fun, huh?

168
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,912
We can enjoy river rafting
on school property!

169
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,248
- Eden is a wonderful place!
- We're going to die!

170
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,582
Don't you worry!

171
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,418
I used to be
in the Marines, and I was very skilled.

172
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,630
Just trust me and enjoy yourself.

173
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,175
All right, let's go straight
to the lake downstream!

174
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,969
It's a beautiful spot!

175
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,222
A little exercise is good for the brain!

176
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,517
Sitting at your desk isn't
the only efficient way to study!

177
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,977
This isn't "little exercise"!

178
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,520
Look at that, kids!

179
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,565
Start rowing on the left side
or we'll crash into that rock!

180
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,696
Mr. Green, there's a waterfall
in front of us!

181
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,206
- Damian!
- Damian!

182
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,920
Help me! I'm the second son
of the Desmond family!

183
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,964
- I'm going right now.
- Hey!

184
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,259
I'm the heir of the Elman family!

185
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,761
I'm the Egeberg family's...

186
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,139
We need to at least save Damian!

187
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,976
That's right.
Fulfill your dreams for our sake too.

188
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:56,270
- You guys...
- Hurry, get on the boat!

189
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,690
- Before we lose our strength!
- Dammit!

190
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,653
I'm sorry to disturb your party,
but it's shallow and there's no current.

191
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,449
- What?
- It was just fast because I was rowing.

192
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:21,420
Hurry up and gather the wood and start
the fire, or you'll catch a cold.

193
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,422
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

194
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,308
It's so warm.

195
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:37,811
Now that we've settled down,
I'm getting hungry.

196
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,105
We're already wet, so let's go fishing.

197
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:43,192
What? You didn't prepare
any sandwiches or anything?

198
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,694
I don't have anything that fancy.

199
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,988
Students of Eden
should find their food on-site.

200
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,698
But...

201
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,327
I'll give you fishing lines and nets,
so figure it out on your own!

202
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,204
What?

203
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,393
Delicious!

204
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,229
- Yes, it sure is!
- It's good, right?

205
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:05,149
The roast beef at Wimpsons is not bad,

206
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,234
but nothing beats your own catch.

207
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:11,113
- It's delicious! Super yummy!
- It's so good!

208
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,575
<i>What am I doing having fun?</i>

209
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,579
<i>Other students are studying
while I'm here.</i>

210
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,961
Doesn't the breeze feel amazing,
young man?

211
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,052
The flickering flame,
and the crackling sound of the fire.

212
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,971
The sound of the leaves rustling,
and the smell of the earth.

213
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:40,392
It's nice to relax and let your
five senses take over, right?

214
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:44,480
I can't become an Imperial Scholar
by being idle.

215
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,607
Have you heard?

216
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,567
According to new research on neuroscience,

217
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,446
your brain revitalizes
while you're being idle.

218
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,867
It's believed to be closely connected
to memory and creativity.

219
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,411
Famous creators and athletes

220
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,456
really value the time they spend
being idle.

221
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,249
If you're being idle,

222
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,252
you might get eight Stella Stars
in no time.

223
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,547
You're lying!

224
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,299
Idle.

225
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,761
Idle, idle.

226
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:19,098
Damian, I don't think that's what
idling is.

227
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,809
<i>- He's pretty simple-minded.</i>
- Idle.

228
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,187
All right,

229
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,314
now that our clothes are dry,

230
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,733
let's walk over to the lake.

231
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,278
"Stella lake."

232
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,657
- That what the students are calling it.
- Stella! I want to go!

233
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,159
Damian, you're too obsessed with
the Stella Stars.

234
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,455
<i>Pic, pic, pic, picnic</i>

235
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,457
By the way, lately there are

236
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,001
people in the south
going through a third country

237
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,463
to seek asylum in the west,
under the pretext of a "picnic."

238
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,551
Mr. Green, are you trying to
sell us to the west?

239
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,721
We can't seek asylum just by walking
two or three kilometers.

240
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,015
Why are they going to the west?

241
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,852
Are there tastier snacks in the west?

242
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,687
I wonder why.

243
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:10,649
Especially when the night sky
in Ostania is this beautiful.

244
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,403
There's nothing to worry about.
Once Damian grows up,

245
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,489
he will make Ostania a better place.

246
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,532
Hey!

247
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:22,244
Oh, you want to become a politician?
That's commendable.

248
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:26,248
- Because Father is a politician.
- I see.

249
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,627
It's wonderful to have
a goal to work towards.

250
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,547
By the way, my dream is to become
an astronaut!

251
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,342
- Is that right? That's cool!
- I... I...

252
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:41,722
- I don't have anything in particular!
- I see, but that's okay too.

253
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,474
I want to live while eating
lots of junk food!

254
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,977
Wonderful! What kind of dream is that?

255
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,354
Now you have to give serious thought

256
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,732
to how to make that possible.

257
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:55,235
And how to maintain good health
while eating a lot.

258
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,653
What a hassle.

259
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:00,657
We're here.

260
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:21,803
Wow! The stars are reflected on
the water. It looks like outer space!

261
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,264
{\an8}Look, young man.

262
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,100
{\an8}- It feels as if I can grab the stars.
- How lame!

263
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,062
Was it a waste of time to come here?

264
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:34,983
{\an8}No.

265
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,819
I think it's beautiful.

266
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,530
{\an8}Yeah.

267
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,408
{\an8}It's beautiful.

268
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,926
- The universe is so big.
- Yeah.

269
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,846
The stars look like sugar crystals.
Looks delicious.

270
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:08,809
That makes no sense!

271
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,853
Damian is laughing.

272
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:17,484
{\an8}- Shut up!
- Come on, let's start heading back.

273
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,362
{\an8}I forgot this was a field research trip.

274
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,073
{\an8}Make sure to write a report.

275
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:27,202
What? Once we get back, I just want to
take a shower and go to sleep.

276
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,496
Oh, that's very healthy of you!

277
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,999
Master Henderson.

278
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,044
I brought over the three boys' report
on the field research trip.

279
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,422
Thank you, Mr. Green.

280
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,716
Were they able to have fun and relax?

281
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,176
I hope they did.

282
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,762
That's very elegant.

283
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,975
<i>I saw and did lots of stuff. It was fun.</i>

284
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,520
But his language skills could use
a little improvement.

285
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,376
{\an8}MISSION:28 - PART A: MISSION AND FAMILY
PART B: THE ELEGANT BONDMAN

286
