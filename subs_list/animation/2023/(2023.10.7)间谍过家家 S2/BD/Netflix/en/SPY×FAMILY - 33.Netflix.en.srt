{\an8}ORIGINAL WORK BY TATSUYA ENDO
SERIALIZED ON SHUEISHA'S SHONEN JUMP PLUS

00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,802
{\an8}MISSION:33
PART A & B: THE SYMPHONY UPON THE SHIP

3
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,805
{\an8}<i>The fireworks show will begin soon.</i>

4
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,431
<i>Please enjoy</i>

5
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,684
<i>the dazzling show as we light up
the sea tonight!</i>

6
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>We hope this will be a memorable
last night of your cruise!</i>

7
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,608
We'll first head to Cargo Room Three,

8
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,693
where the inflatable boats are stored.

9
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,445
That's where the Director will be.

10
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,949
<i>We'll lower the boat from the fore
of Deck Two's emergency exit.</i>

11
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,951
<i>Then the rendezvous ship will pick you up.</i>

12
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,454
- Before the fireworks end...
- What should we do tonight?

13
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:06,209
- How about the fireworks show?
- You idiot! Let's go to the casino!

14
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,587
Let's hit the jackpot and say goodbye
to our job at city hall.

15
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,172
The Director will get mad at us.

16
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,176
- We shouldn't let our guard down.
- Okay.

17
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,100
<i>Blueless No. 89 and Mermaid.</i>

18
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,602
<i>Both of them are popular fragrances</i>

19
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:29,190
<i>but the combination of those two,
plus a woman with no scent.</i>

20
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,110
<i>One man, and two women, with one child.</i>

21
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,446
<i>I found you!</i>

22
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,826
Anya loves fireworks!

23
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,369
- Is that right?
- Papa!

24
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,246
I want to go see that side too!

25
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,292
It's so crowded, I can't see the sky.

26
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,759
- I wonder if I'll be able to find Mother.
- It won't be that easy.

27
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,845
<i>When will the fireworks begin?</i>

28
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,515
<i>I won't be able to catch Mother's thoughts
over this buzz of excitement.</i>

29
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,727
<i>I have to concentrate and search her out.</i>

30
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,734
<i>Those guys are most likely assassins.</i>

31
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,320
<i>They're guarding this area too!</i>

32
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,237
Time for a detour.

33
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,908
<i>They're here too!</i>

34
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,161
<i>They're blocking all the routes
to the ship's bow!</i>

35
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,413
<i>I can take them down and move forward,</i>

36
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:29,125
<i>but they might call for backup
and they might find out our destination.</i>

37
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,170
- Let's head up to the deck for now.
- Will we be okay?

38
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:36,925
The Director gave me the keys
for the crew members' corridors.

39
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,178
Let's move quietly by passing over
secluded rooftops.

40
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,641
No sign of anyone.

41
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,393
It's loud thanks to the fireworks show,

42
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,187
but try to move as quietly as possible.

43
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,232
Okay.

44
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,191
Let's go!

45
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,454
- That was startling!
- It's okay.

46
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,207
- The fireworks are very pretty.
- Let's move while it's loud.

47
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,467
We'll go up here.

48
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,179
All right.

49
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,642
Wow.

50
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,895
Let's hurry on over to that side.

51
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,400
There are two black-haired women.
Is it the one with the kid?

52
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,486
<i>Right. If possible, kill the child too.</i>

53
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,822
Roger.

54
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:49,998
<i>She dodged it!</i>

55
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,047
<i>Oh my, he dodged it.</i>

56
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,897
Are you hurt?

57
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,816
- Olka!
- I'm okay...

58
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,234
I think.

59
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,247
<i>- I didn't sense them at all.</i>
- Whoa, whoa!

60
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,584
<i>They're all strong!</i>

61
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,594
<i>There's no way to escape.</i>

62
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,724
I won't miss this time.
I'll take you out first.

63
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,276
Oh sheesh,

64
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,279
I was wondering where you had gone
wandering off to.

65
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,697
Director!

66
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,158
<i>She has backup, huh?</i>

67
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,121
Both of you, run!

68
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,956
Take cover under that hatch!

69
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,166
I won't let them go!

70
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,758
- Hurry, get in!
- What a shame.

71
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,344
<i>My blind spot!</i>

72
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,977
Zeb!

73
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,694
Zeb!

74
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,739
That hurts!

75
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,116
It hurts like hell even though

76
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,492
- I have a bulletproof vest on!
- Don't be so reckless!

77
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,369
Good work, Mr. Husband!

78
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,672
Now the hatch can't be opened that easily.

79
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,924
You're satisfied with that?

80
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,426
I'll blow everything up all together!

81
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,162
Excuse me.

82
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,167
Stay behind the walls!

83
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,961
This is not good. The deck is a mess.

84
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,715
We'll have to clean up
and get rid of any evidence.

85
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,852
Got you--

86
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,242
Try to finish them off
without leaving too much evidence.

87
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,203
The cleanup is a hassle.

88
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,121
Mr. Director! When did you get here?

89
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,833
- I'm sorry, but there's so many of them.
- I guess you have no choice.

90
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,586
It seems like they're all skilled
in this trade.

91
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,047
A lot of foreign faces
with unfamiliar fighting styles.

92
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,591
But,

93
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,427
they're no match for us in the Garden.

94
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,723
They conveniently gathered in one place.

95
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,099
Let's wipe them all out.

96
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,941
It's a red one now!

97
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,985
<i>How can she maintain this excitement
without getting bored?</i>

98
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,571
Bravo!

99
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,754
Vides, this is insane! I won the jackpot!

100
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,939
<i>It's a poisonous mist strong enough
to knock out a bear!</i>

101
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,443
My, my, such bad manners!

102
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,073
I'm Esmerelda, Master of Wire.

103
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm King of Chakram--

104
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,166
<i>The fireworks show is reaching
its climactic finale!</i>

105
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,342
- That hurts!
<i>- All it did was give her pain?</i>

106
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,703
<i>The show has come to an end!</i>

107
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,968
I stubbed my finger!

108
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,109
You killed all of them.

109
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,403
You're a horrible woman.

110
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,699
Yes, I killed them. It's only natural.
I'm sorry,

111
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,035
but anyone who points a blade at someone

112
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,746
has no right to complain
when it's pointed back at them.

113
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,706
That goes for me as well.

114
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,166
You're so serious.

115
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,711
I don't care how many you killed,
because I get a bigger share now.

116
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,091
It's a little late to bring it up now,
but can you just give up and leave?

117
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,968
To avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

118
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,971
- You dare to underestimate us?
- We can't accept that offer.

119
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,515
We received our payment in advance,

120
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,726
and we can't leave even if we want to,
because we're on a ship.

121
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,730
And it doesn't seem like that old man
will let us leave to begin with.

122
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,482
Stop glaring at them, Director!

123
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,486
They view war as a game
to make some money.

124
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,490
If we let them go, they will
definitely cause harm to our country.

125
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,993
You're so old-fashioned, Mr. Soldier.

126
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,870
Learn some tips from the west.

127
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,538
Money is power.

128
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,498
Being rich will make everyone happy.

129
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:33,419
For being a businessman,
you lack foresight.

130
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:37,006
Repent on playing with fire,
as you're being eaten by sharks.

131
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,760
You guys are the ones
who will be eaten by sharks.

132
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,445
Director!

133
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,044
<i>My grip strength...</i>

134
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,462
It's the end.

135
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,352
Don't fight it.
It'll only prolong the pain.

136
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,021
<i>He's in a different league to the others.</i>

137
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,233
<i>My feet are heavy again.</i>

138
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,448
In any situation you are
seriously injured, or you die,

139
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,826
I will tell Forger that you moved
due to an unexpected transfer.

140
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,331
<i>If I disappear without a word...</i>

141
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,335
<i>I'll really be a horrible woman.</i>

142
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,095
It'll be suspicious
if my hairstyle changes!

143
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,681
Yor, you got a haircut
while entertaining guests?

144
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,350
Oh, I cut my hair because that offer
was turned down...

145
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,853
<i>No, I don't have time
to be worrying about that!</i>

146
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,773
<i>At this rate, I'll be chopped in half!</i>

147
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,620
Young lady, if you're scared of dying,
you should be the one to give up.

148
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,623
That will never happen!

149
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,126
I won't allow you to hurt Olka
and her family!

150
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,337
Underlings like you and I
have it so hard, huh?

151
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,799
If you give up, we'll share
some of the payment with you.

152
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,552
- I don't want to get hurt either.
- I don't want it!

153
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,636
Stop spouting nonsense.

154
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,390
It's not nonsense.
This is a very serious business offer.

155
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,559
You also kill to make a living.

156
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,144
We're both of the same ilk.

157
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,063
We're nothing alike! I'm doing this...

158
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:02,192
<i>...To support my family... wait...</i>

159
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,111
<i>I guess I'm doing this for money too.</i>

160
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,614
<i>No, I have enough to make a living
right now.</i>

161
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,324
<i>I get rid of bad guys for my country.</i>

162
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:13,787
<i>For my country? Was I doing it
for such a good cause?</i>

163
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,415
<i>What am I doing this for...</i>

164
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,462
Oh crap!

165
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,609
<i>Oh my, he's about to kill me.
What should I do?</i>

166
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,820
<i>I won't be able to pick up Loid's shirt</i>

167
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,031
<i>at the dry cleaners.</i>

168
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:53,369
<i>I also have to return
the book Anya borrowed from the library.</i>

169
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,038
<i>Wait, what am I saying?</i>

170
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,916
<i>Why is this man pointing</i>

171
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,043
<i>a big sword at me?</i>

172
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,046
<i>Oh, my head hurts.</i>

173
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,049
<i>I'm a little tired.</i>

174
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:10,094
<i>Sis!</i>

175
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,555
<i>Yuri is flashing before my eyes.</i>

176
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,850
Yahoo! Sis, I got a job
at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs!

177
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,061
<i>Yuri, you grew up so well.</i>

178
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:22,731
- I bought this with my first paycheck!
<i>- You can survive without my support.</i>

179
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,110
<i>I don't need to work as an assassin
any longer.</i>

180
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,989
<i>That's right. Let's end it here.</i>

181
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,991
<i>If I die,</i>

182
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,077
<i>I won't be able to go to the dry cleaners,
or the library.</i>

183
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,664
We're done here. Get rid of Olka
and the rest.

184
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,581
Roger.

185
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:45,087
- I won't allow it.
- This woman...

186
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,130
<i>Olka.</i>

187
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:50,843
<i>Olka. Why was I protecting her again?</i>

188
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,847
I just want to live a quiet life.

189
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,186
<i>That's right.</i>

190
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,856
<i>The reason why I started doing this job,</i>

191
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,025
<i>and the reason why I continue to do it...</i>

192
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,445
<i>I was so busy with life
that I had forgotten.</i>

193
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,240
<i>Is it for money? For our country?</i>

194
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,243
<i>It is, but it's not.</i>

195
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,370
<i>I just wanted to</i>

196
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,206
<i>protect his</i>

197
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,374
<i>carefree life.</i>

198
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,337
<i>This world is scattered with
unwarranted misfortunes.</i>

199
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,048
<i>In order to reduce that,</i>

200
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:32,676
<i>and to prevent it from harming him,
I have to keep the world clean.</i>

201
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,971
<i>I'll continue doing that. In fact,</i>

202
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,890
<i>even more so now.</i>

203
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,065
<i>I don't need to be at peace.</i>

204
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,152
<i>I don't care if my hands
are stained with blood.</i>

205
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,656
<i>Even if this way of life
could kill me at any moment...</i>

206
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:04,166
<i>Even if it means I have to leave
the Forger family...</i>

207
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,169
<i>Enduring</i>

208
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:11,423
<i>a grueling job for someone,
or for some cause,</i>

209
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,383
<i>is something to be proud of.</i>

210
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,679
<i>I'm sure Loid will give me his approval.</i>

211
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,680
<i>He will understand.</i>

212
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,197
<i>I will not</i>

213
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,491
<i>stop fighting!</i>

MISSION:33
PART C: SIS'S HERB TEA

215
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,462
The suspect went through the back.

216
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,631
- Let's attack from both sides, Yuri!
- Roger!

217
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,521
Yuri! What happened?
Did the suspect injure you?

218
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,732
Lieutenant,

219
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,610
it seems like I've caught a cold.

220
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,946
All of a sudden?

221
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,700
It's so unlike you to get sick.

222
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,118
When...

223
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,623
When I think of how far away my sister is,
my cells begin debilitating...

224
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,877
Oh you said she was on a business trip
on a cruise ship, right?

225
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,129
I'm sorry for letting
the criminal get away.

226
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,882
Just sleep for now.
I'll be going to the pharmacy.

227
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,719
I'm sorry, but can you pick up
some herbal tea as well?

228
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,389
- The one with the bear logo.
- Fine.

229
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,895
<i>Whenever I catch a cold,
it reminds me of my childhood.</i>

230
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,399
Oh no! You have a fever, Yuri!

231
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,235
What should I do?

232
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,905
Calm down, Sis. I'll get better
with some rest.

233
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,408
Let's start by getting you warmed up.

234
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,411
- Here's all the blankets we have!
- That's too much, Sis!

235
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,289
You wrap green onions around the neck
in the Far East.

236
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,915
I can't breathe, Sis!

237
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:36,128
Nothing works better for a cold
than herbal tea with honey.

238
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,463
Use elderflowers, and sage--

239
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,924
Thank you, neighbor!
I'll head off to the mountains!

240
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,426
I'm back, Yuri!

241
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,053
I picked lots of things that are
good for your body!

242
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,431
Sis! What happened to you?

243
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,225
I ended up annoying the bees a little.

244
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,313
I also fought with a boar.
I'll make some hotpot.

245
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,315
I'll start by making some herbal tea.

246
00:21:56,398 --> 00:22:00,569
<i>This is not good. If I catch a cold again,
Sis will end up dying.</i>

247
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,030
<i>I have to become sturdy and strong!</i>

248
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:09,453
Get well, Yuri.

249
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,665
- Sis.
- Yeah?

250
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,461
I'm so glad I'm your younger brother.

251
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,717
Stop acting as if you're going to die!

252
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,469
I'm okay.

253
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,224
I'm also very glad
that you're here with me, Yuri.

254
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,977
- Stay healthy forever.
- Sis.

255
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,481
<i>For my kind Sis,</i>

256
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,275
<i>I will make this world a kinder place.</i>

257
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,696
Here. Drink this and get better.

258
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,989
Thank you!

259
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,454
This drink is warming me up!

260
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,497
I'm so glad!

261
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,540
Something strange is happening to my body,

262
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,668
so I no longer feel
the symptoms of my cold!

263
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,504
I'm so glad!

264
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,384
Are you okay? You were groaning
in your sleep.

265
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,098
- I bought what you requested.
- Thank you.

266
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,892
This is famous for its disgusting taste.

267
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,895
This works best.

268
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,690
This also tastes similar
to the tea that Sis made me.

269
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,738
I've recovered!
Let's go catch that criminal!

270
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,198
Let's cleanse this world.

271
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,867
- Before Sis comes back--
- Go to sleep!
