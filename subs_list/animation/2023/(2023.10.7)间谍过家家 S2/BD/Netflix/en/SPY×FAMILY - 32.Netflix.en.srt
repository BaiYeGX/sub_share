{\an8}ORIGINAL WORK BY TATSUYA ENDO
SERIALIZED ON SHUEISHA'S SHONEN JUMP PLUS

00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,928
{\an8}MISSION:32
WHO IS THIS MISSION FOR?

3
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,893
Both of you, stand back!

4
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,646
<i>I've never seen a weapon like that.</i>

5
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,856
<i>Is it an intermediate-range?</i>

6
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,734
<i>It'll be hard to escape
with the two of them.</i>

7
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,361
<i>In that case...</i>

8
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,536
<i>He won't let me get close.</i>

9
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,622
<i>He's very skilled with his weapon.</i>

10
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,125
- What's going on?
- Is it a fight?

11
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,585
- Is he wielding a weapon?
- Someone call State Security.

12
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,711
<i>This is not good!</i>

13
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,090
<i>We're totally attracting attention.</i>

14
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,801
<i>What should I do?
At this rate, we'll cause a commotion!</i>

15
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,553
Wow! How amazing!

16
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,933
<i>Anya? Oh crap! I can't have her
see me like this!</i>

17
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:26,396
Wow! You're so cool, Circus Lady!

18
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,278
Oh, this is a performance?

19
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,238
This luxury cruise doesn't disappoint!

20
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,659
<i>What a lifesaver.</i>

21
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,162
<i>It seems like Anya hasn't recognized me.</i>

22
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,621
<i>Let's wrap this up quickly.</i>

23
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,334
Amazing!

24
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:51,671
<i>There's a crowd in this hallway,
and nowhere to take shelter.</i>

25
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,673
<i>Olka and her family are behind me.</i>

26
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:56,509
<i>This is difficult.
I can't get close to him.</i>

27
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,264
<i>No, that's not it.</i>

28
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,017
<i>I'm dragging my feet.</i>

29
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,520
<i>Why? Am I hesitating to get close to him?</i>

30
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,900
<i>I know that an injury from that weapon
wouldn't be fatal.</i>

31
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,485
You can do it, Miss!

32
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,905
<i>You have to take him down
before Father comes back.</i>

33
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,698
<i>At this rate,</i>

34
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,910
<i>I should just grab the chain and drag
him down even if I'm to get injured.</i>

35
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,038
<i>But if I don't make it look more
like a performance,</i>

36
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,831
<i>will everyone get suspicious?</i>

37
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,585
<i>What should I do?</i>

38
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:34,255
- You can do it, old man!
- Show us more flashy moves!

39
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,968
<i>Dammit. I was struggling a bit,
so there's a big crowd now.</i>

40
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,261
<i>They're a hassle.</i>

41
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:44,265
<i>I'll get rid of all the crowd,
together with my target.</i>

42
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,347
Bravo!

43
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,432
What an amazing performance!

44
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,685
Although I didn't understand the story.

45
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,603
<i>Mother is scary.</i>

46
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,856
<i>I think I'll be a little bit more
obedient from now on.</i>

47
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,650
<i>All right! This is perfect.</i>

48
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,860
<i>- She's definitely going to love this!</i>
- Father!

49
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,696
I have to return to the shop!

50
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,700
Where have you been?

51
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,202
There was a circus performance over there...

52
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,580
<i>Anya has accomplished her task!</i>

53
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,291
<i>I helped Mother</i>

54
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,210
<i>and completed my mission
without Father finding out!</i>

55
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,088
<i>Heroic Anya!</i>

56
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:01,217
<i>I can barely calm my heart
from this exciting adventure!</i>

57
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,646
I'll take all of this.

58
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,816
It... it suits you well.

59
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,320
<i>This is flawless.</i>

60
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,239
<i>No matter how you look at it,
I'm a happy, and cheerful dad!</i>

61
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,075
So damn uncool. I'm disappointed.

62
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,081
Let's go.

63
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,586
But man, what kind of crazy fight
did that couple have in that room?

64
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,839
The ice pick was all finagled!
It's so scary!

65
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,426
I'm glad no one was murdered on this ship.

66
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,845
Seriously!

67
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:07,867
<i>Blueless No. 89
and Mermaid eau de toilette.</i>

68
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,120
<i>This is a different perfume
from the one at the manor.</i>

69
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,332
<i>I guess she changed her perfume
together with her face.</i>

70
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,502
<i>There was at least one man and two women.</i>

71
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:20,463
<i>Maybe the one I'm not smelling
is the female bodyguard.</i>

72
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,759
It's me. Where are they now?

73
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,136
<i>Don't know.</i>

74
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:31,641
It's highly likely that they're hiding
in the second or third-class cabins.

75
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,726
But I haven't picked up anything yet.

76
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,895
<i>I'll post some people around that area.</i>

77
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,440
<i>Judging by this ship's route,</i>

78
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:43,653
<i>they'll rendezvous with the other ship
after tomorrow night.</i>

79
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,532
<i>When the time comes, they'll have
no choice but to come out of hiding.</i>

80
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,450
<i>Keep doing what you do best.</i>

81
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,660
Yeah.

82
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,750
<i>- Did you find them?
- No, not yet.</i>

83
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,294
<i>They told us to head to Deck Three.</i>

84
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,881
What a useless informant.

85
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,801
He better not be planning
to run away with our money.

86
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,514
I won't let him do that.
In fact, I'll take back

87
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,809
everything I paid him, before I disembark.

88
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,771
<i>- What will you do with the money?
- Let's see...</i>

89
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,941
<i>There's never a shortage of idiots.</i>

90
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,153
<i>I should at least make some preparations.</i>

91
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,577
{\an8}Hey, where are you going?
Our room is this way.

92
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,455
{\an8}- Mother is in trouble.
- Yor?

93
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,749
I'm sure she's working until late,

94
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,751
but you don't have to worry.

95
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,463
It's time for kids to be in bed. Let's go.

96
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,842
Anya's adventure has barely begun.

97
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,439
<i>She didn't contact us,
so it must mean that she's busy.</i>

98
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,941
We weren't followed, and no bugs.

99
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,944
I think we can rest here for a while.

100
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:11,491
It seems like the Director
left food here for us as well.

101
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,535
I think we can stay confined
until your ship comes.

102
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,539
It's all right. Stay quiet.

103
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,169
I was so scared!

104
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:27,131
Who the hell were they?
They were really assassins?

105
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,301
They were shooting
and wielding chains onboard!

106
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,470
You've got to be kidding me!
I want to leave!

107
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,388
Calm down, you dummy.

108
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,059
But did you see those huge men?

109
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,185
They were huge!

110
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,648
You're such a coward.

111
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,942
You're so pathetic,
it makes me want to cry.

112
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,070
You too, little one?

113
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,241
You can't grow up to be like him, okay?

114
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,914
Why did you come with me anyway?

115
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:04,043
You didn't have to get yourself involved
in all this danger.

116
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:06,921
You should've stayed
with the new organization.

117
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:10,258
It's because...

118
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,425
of you...

119
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,344
- What?
- Well...

120
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,015
Please don't underestimate me.

121
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,227
I'm not so hopeless that I would
forget all that Boss did for me.

122
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,398
<i>After the war, when there was no food,</i>

123
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,526
<i>I would've died of hunger
if it wasn't for your family's</i>

124
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,528
<i>black market.</i>

125
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,530
Here, take this.

126
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,041
It's our secret.

127
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,714
Hey Olka. Where are you?

128
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,177
<i>I still remember the taste of that bread.</i>

129
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,558
That's more than enough reason
for me to be here.

130
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,269
Zeb.

131
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,356
Plus, did you know

132
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,026
Hapoon is currying favors with warmongers

133
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,404
in order to make money
in the arms industry? He's a bastard.

134
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,948
You can count on me!

135
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:20,036
Even if Hapoon's minions come after us,
I'll beat them up like crazy!

136
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,706
Sorry, that was a lie!

137
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,209
Welcome.

138
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:35,092
In the last room, you forgot about our
secret knock and tried to open the door.

139
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,261
I'm sorry. I'll be more careful!

140
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,890
The three of you should rest
in preparation for tomorrow.

141
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,060
I'll be placing Forger at the door.

142
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,145
How can we sleep in this situation?

143
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,151
- What about you, Director?
- I'll be patrolling this floor

144
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:56,155
and if possible, I'll reduce
the number of enemies.

145
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,616
You guys are really amazing.

146
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,994
You guys are so calm even when your
life's on the line. How can you do that?

147
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,497
This is our job.

148
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,750
So "kill or get killed,"
is a normal thing?

149
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,293
I have no words.

150
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:11,504
It's been over ten years
since the war ended,

151
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,674
but I guess there are still wars going on
all over the place.

152
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,848
As long as humans exist,
there will be no end to fighting.

153
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,143
Whether we're at war or at peace,

154
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,397
we're just soldiers for our country.

155
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,652
If need be, I will send you a signal
with my footsteps.

156
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,946
Don't let your guard down.

157
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,155
Yes, I understand.

158
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,659
- Forger?
- Yes?

159
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:46,163
Focus on your mission.
Or everyone will die.

160
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,425
How scary!
That's what you call a pro, huh?

161
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:01,637
Just as the Director said,
all of you should rest.

162
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,973
Or just lie down.

163
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,725
You have to gain strength for tomorrow.

164
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,895
Please keep your shoes on
in case of emergency.

165
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,314
I understand.

166
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,317
I'll turn off the lights.

167
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,058
<i>Come to think of it,</i>

168
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,229
<i>I never got the chance to contact
Loid and Anya.</i>

169
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,857
<i>My situation wouldn't allow that, but...</i>

170
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,326
<i>Maybe I was dragging my feet</i>

171
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,830
<i>because I was afraid of getting hurt.</i>

172
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:15,252
<i>If I get wounded so badly that I have
no excuse to tell Loid and Anya,</i>

173
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,339
<i>I wouldn't be able to live
with them anymore.</i>

174
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,092
Your family is just for your cover, right?

175
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,890
<i>That's right, Yor.</i>

176
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,476
<i>You must set your priorities straight.</i>

177
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,482
<i>For what...</i>

178
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,737
<i>For what am I...?</i>

179
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,909
APPROXIMATELY 20 HOURS
UNTIL THE RENDEZVOUS

180
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,293
Why am I looking after this dog
so early in the morning?

181
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,171
Don't you bark at me, dammit!

182
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,591
I'm not a pet-sitter or a babysitter!

183
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,135
I'm busy with my underground things!
Give me back my time!

184
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,930
Oh my, what a cute dog!

185
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:08,889
What?

186
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,435
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

187
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,856
This is my first time I've seen you here.
Do you live around here?

188
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,316
Oh... ah... kind of...

189
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,862
I hope we bump into each other again!

190
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,159
Do you want to be my dog?

191
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,624
<i>My name is Twilight.</i>

192
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,127
<i>I'm the number one spy in Westalis.</i>

193
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,754
<i>No matter what the situation,</i>

194
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,591
<i>even if I'm placed in the jaws of death,</i>

195
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,594
<i>I'm trained to remain calm.</i>

196
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,055
<i>The power of observation, discernment,
and adaptability.</i>

197
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,808
<i>I honed such skills to the limit,</i>

198
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,227
<i>and that's how I survived this world
until today.</i>

199
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:58,022
<i>- But...</i>
- Go away!

200
00:14:58,814 --> 00:14:59,773
So damn uncool.

201
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,778
<i>I had become big-headed.</i>

202
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,240
<i>There are still many things
in this world that I don't know.</i>

203
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,786
<i>I shouldn't let my knowledge
and experience make me overconfident.</i>

204
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,039
<i>The root of all human's fear is
the "unknown."</i>

205
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,668
<i>Death, invisible evil spirits, neighboring
countries, and next door neighbors.</i>

206
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,755
<i>Their "unknown identities"
is what provokes fear.</i>

207
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,799
<i>Some brush it aside as something
"unable to understand,"</i>

208
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,011
<i>and turn a blind eye. Others would</i>

209
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,306
<i>label it as what they see fit,
and put their hearts at ease.</i>

210
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,519
<i>I... I am a spy.</i>

211
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,480
<i>I do not fear the unknown.</i>

212
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:43,484
<i>No, I will face the fear rationally,
and I will deal with it.</i>

213
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,696
<i>Just like how scientists lit up
the darkness...</i>

214
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,491
<i>and how they discovered
new viruses and vaccines...</i>

215
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,619
<i>Second day of the cruise.</i>

216
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,872
<i>I will overcome this difficult situation!</i>

217
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,093
- What?
- We're done entertaining the guests?

218
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,137
It seems like they had a big fight
last night.

219
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,140
Mrs. Grey got very angry about

220
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,558
Mr. Grey soiling his pants.

221
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,186
{\an8}<i>So they're not in the mood
for any entertainment.</i>

222
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,271
{\an8}<i>I... I see.</i>

223
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,233
<i>- What about the business invitation...
- Back to square one.</i>

224
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,195
Don't worry.
You guys didn't do anything wrong.

225
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,030
I'll look after the couple.

226
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,158
You two can enjoy yourselves today.

227
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,744
- I understand.
<i>- Hooray!</i>

228
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:41,750
<i>Time for an adventure. Time for exploring</i>

229
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:45,796
<i>Another day of heroic Anya's trip!</i>

230
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,257
<i>- Observe. Discern. Adapt.
- Exciting adventure</i>

231
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,760
<i>- What's the meaning behind these lyrics?
- Exciting time exploring</i>

232
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,013
<i>I fell asleep last night,</i>

233
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,766
<i>but I have to hurry up and find Mother
so that I can help her. But...</i>

234
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,060
Father, Mother's in trouble

235
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,271
so we have to go help her now!

236
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,023
What do you mean?

237
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,651
No way! Yor battles with people?

238
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,237
How can this be? Oh my god!

239
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,197
<i>That's what'll happen,
so I can't tell him!</i>

240
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:16,201
<i>I have to do something
and ditch Father somewhere.</i>

241
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:20,205
Look Father! It's a place to play golf!

242
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,751
- You want to try it?
<i>- For some reason, adults love to golf.</i>

243
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,758
<i>While Father is engrossed with golfing,</i>

244
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,342
<i>I'm going to slip away.</i>

245
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,432
A hole-in-one for every hole?

246
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:42,436
- Bravo!
<i>- Oh no! He finished already!</i>

247
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,480
Here. Give it a try.

248
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,439
It's fun.

249
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,653
Argh!

250
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:54,448
Calm down, and aim well.

251
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,164
It's almost time for lunch.

252
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,707
I won't leave until it goes in!

253
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,336
<i>A successful experience is important.</i>

254
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,838
<i>I'll let her continue
until she's satisfied.</i>

255
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,507
<i>Discern and adapt.</i>

256
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,302
- Don't get too loud and disturb others.
- Argh!

257
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,851
<i>I fell for Father's trap
and wasted my time!</i>

258
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,437
<i>I need to think of a new plan!</i>

259
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,605
Chew well.

260
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,191
<i>Father loves to take in knowledge.</i>

261
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,110
<i>I'm sure he'll lose
his sense of time here!</i>

262
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,448
<i>These are all books I've read before.</i>

263
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,535
COMIC

264
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,453
<i>But I'm glad she's having fun.</i>

265
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,871
Oh, I forgot!

266
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,251
Puzzles are so much fun.

267
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:51,213
It looks really difficult,
so I think I'll need your help, Father.

268
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,591
<i>I can probably finish this in two minutes.</i>

269
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,009
<i>Let's see.</i>

270
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,349
<i>Observe.</i>

271
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,936
- Wow!
<i>- Observe.</i>

272
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,486
<i>I haven't been able to ditch Father,
and it's already dinner!</i>

273
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,948
<i>Not only that, I was having so much fun,
I forgot about Mother!</i>

274
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,116
<i>Argh!</i>

275
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,035
<i>Why? Why is she scowling at me?</i>

276
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,037
<i>It seemed like she was having so much fun!</i>

277
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,790
<i>Why does she look so upset right now?</i>

278
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,501
<i>Did I make some sort of a mistake?</i>

279
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,962
<i>Calm down, Twilight. Face the unknown.</i>

280
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,339
<i>Does she hate me?
Is this the rebellious phase?</i>

281
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,467
<i>At this rate,
the Forger family will fall apart.</i>

282
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,805
Does your stomach hurt? Are you okay?

283
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,309
<i>I’m troubling Father.</i>

284
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,479
I'm okay. I'm enjoying this adventure.

285
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,024
Is that so? Then I'm glad.

286
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,612
But I'm a little lonely
that Mother isn't with us.

287
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,991
I want to be with both Father and Mother.

288
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:04,119
<i>That's why I have to go
by myself to help Mother.</i>

289
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,079
I see.

290
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,247
<i>She's right.</i>

291
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,666
It would've been nice
if Yor had time off work.

292
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,503
<i>She's still a young child.</i>

293
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,299
It won't hurt to ask Yor
if she's open tomorrow.

294
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,468
You know where Mother is?

295
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,222
No, but I'll have the concierge
deliver her a message for me.

296
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,934
- Once she replies, we can meet up.
- Okay!

297
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,687
By the way, there's going to be
a fireworks show on the deck tonight.

298
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,399
It's tonight's main event,

299
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:37,361
so Yor and her group might be there too.

300
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,489
It might be hard to find her
among the crowd, but want to go?

301
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,658
Fireworks! Yes, I want to go!

302
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,261
Yes.

303
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:03,804
Yes.

304
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,099
It was the Director.

305
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,561
He received a message from the ship
waiting for you guys, and they're ready.

306
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,189
We'll be meeting them in four hours,

307
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,108
but we need to make preparations.

308
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:20,821
More importantly, this deck
is surrounded by enemies,

309
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,948
so we'll leave this room
and head somewhere else.

310
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,993
<i>Please get changed.
We have wigs prepared too.</i>

311
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,953
<i>Okay. Got it.</i>

312
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,748
It's me. Any movement?

313
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,127
I intercepted an unidentified
encrypted communication.

314
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,046
It's not the frequency used
by the State Security.

315
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,757
<i>- Is it a message for those people?</i>
- It's a possibility.

316
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,510
Okay. Notifying everyone.

317
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,972
Get into your stage three positions
and lie in wait for them.

318
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,439
All right. All clear.

319
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,482
Let's go.

320
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,918
