{\an8}ORIGINAL WORK BY TATSUYA ENDO
SERIALIZED ON SHUEISHA'S SHONEN JUMP PLUS

2
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,275
It seems like the targets have entered
the room. There are three of them.

3
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,237
The ones in the back are hefty in size.

4
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,199
They're standing away from
windows and doors.

5
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,159
Their footsteps tell me that they're pros.

6
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,168
Conrad sat down on the couch
against the wall.

7
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,546
Hand over the goods.

8
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,881
We'll pay you after that.

9
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,301
You better keep your promise.

10
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:20,140
<i>Yup, this is the MNG data.</i>

11
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,016
<i>Then, as promised...</i>

12
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,311
- They made the deal.
- All right, let's go in.

13
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,064
- Yuri.
- Roger!

14
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,868
State Security Service.

15
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,955
You're under arrest
for suspicion of espionage.

16
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,627
Dammit!

17
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:52,088
Out of my way!

18
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,635
Good evening, piece of trash.

19
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,638
I have a lovely cell reserved for you,

20
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,599
so please come with us to the station.

21
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:08,646
MISSION:28
PART A: MISSION AND FAMILY

22
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,649
Good work, Lieutenant Briar.

23
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,484
Thank you.

24
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,738
This is your next assignment.

25
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,325
Are you aware that there are some
books and articles from the west

26
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:23,244
that mock and ridicule Ostania?

27
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,665
The contents are all vulgar things
like fabrications and conspiracy theories.

28
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,542
{\an8}Most of them are sold to the west

29
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,253
{\an8}through an underground
publishing company in Ostania.

30
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,171
{\an8}THE REAL OSTANIA:
INSIDE THE DEVIL'S REPUBLIC

31
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,674
And this name surfaced from among

32
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,760
the writers.

33
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,640
Franklin Perkin, 39 years old.

34
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,267
During the past administration,
he was a newspaper journalist

35
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,812
but he was arrested for stirring up
the anti-government extremist groups.

36
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:55,068
Tail him, gather evidence,
and catch the people buying his works.

37
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,986
Although these are stupid articles,

38
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,698
there are tons of idiots in the west
who will fall for it.

39
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,868
Get rid of it before it begins
to affect the public opinion.

40
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,205
Aren't you overworking, Yuri?

41
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,582
Don't worry about me!

42
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,586
This man is making money
by degrading his own country.

43
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:18,466
Just the thought of someone like this
breathing the same air as my sister,

44
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,094
makes me sick.

45
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,309
{\an8}<i>Observation of J-095, Franklin Perkin.</i>

46
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:34,399
{\an8}<i>On the 6th, the subject wakes up at 7:21,
and watches</i> Good Morning Ostania.

47
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,109
{\an8}<i>The subject curses at the newscaster.</i>

48
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:42,115
{\an8}<i>At 8:10, the subject leaves for his job
at the post office.</i>

49
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,743
{\an8}<i>See attachment for details of his attire.</i>

50
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,837
{\an8}<i>The subject rides on the third car
of the U-8 train.</i>

51
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,589
{\an8}<i>See attachment for description
of fellow passengers.</i>

52
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,094
{\an8}<i>At 12:06 p.m., the subject goes to
the restaurant Fjord with coworker M.</i>

53
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,932
{\an8}<i>He orders the set lunch A.
See attachment for the conversation topic.</i>

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,563
{\an8}<i>At 5:49 p.m., the subject leaves work
and goes to the central market.</i>

55
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:26,617
<i>The 12th Global Education Symposium
was held today.</i>

56
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:27,535
{\an8}<i>Sonia...</i>

57
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,163
{\an8}<i>At 7:33 p.m., the subject returns home,</i>

58
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:34,167
{\an8}<i>and watches the shows: News 20,
and</i> Berlint In Love <i>after dinner.</i>

59
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,793
{\an8}<i>Infatuated with the female lead.</i>

60
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,628
{\an8}<i>-Why?
- Because I love you!</i>

61
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,923
<i>No notable activities
until he retired for the night.</i>

62
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,179
- You did thorough research on this man.
- You can count on me!

63
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,641
You've been doing this for two days
without any sleep.

64
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,644
Take shifts so that you can rest.

65
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,229
This is nothing.

66
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,857
Here's the report for the following day.

67
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,445
On the 7th, at 8:07 a.m.,
the subject left for work.

68
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,906
Ordered set lunch B at Fjord.

69
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,744
Fjord.

70
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,080
Yor.

71
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:17,376
- You're exhausted. Take a rest.
- No, this is my usual self.

72
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,802
Mr. Perkin! Mr. Perkin, I know
you're in there!

73
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,105
- Hey, landlady.
- Hurry up.

74
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,690
Give me your unpaid rent!

75
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,569
Can you give me a little more time?

76
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,696
You said the same thing last time!

77
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,450
Day after tomorrow!
I'll pay you the day after tomorrow.

78
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,286
If you don't, I'm definitely going to
kick you out this time!

79
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,501
That damned landlady.

80
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,925
<i>Dad, I'm going out for a bit.
I made dinner so make sure you eat it.</i>

81
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,885
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

82
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,148
Does he suspect he's being followed?

83
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,569
Or he's looking for something
to write an article about.

84
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,910
In response to this, our country

85
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,538
must take a firm stance!

86
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:39,333
That's right!
Make those in the west pay for this!

87
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,771
I can't get anything worthwhile.

88
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:14,118
My parents got me this Bondman pistol!

89
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:18,039
Wow! I'm so jealous! Let me borrow it!

90
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,918
- No way.
- You're so stingy.

91
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,630
Hey!

92
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,426
My pistol!

93
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,809
Destitute street children

94
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,813
rummaging through garbage for scraps.
Not bad.

95
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:44,899
Why did you do that, old man?!

96
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,360
I'll tell on you to the Secret Police!

97
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,575
You're a little miser who hoards wealth
and refuses to share with others.

98
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,663
Someone like you
with ideologies of the west

99
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,917
will end up getting arrested, and killed.

100
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,127
- That jerk! I'll kill him!
- Stop it.

101
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:11,133
Leave him be until we get the buyer
from the underground publishing company.

102
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,522
<i>This article will be a hoot!</i>

103
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,904
Frank.

104
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,739
Dad.

105
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:38,578
You're not taking on
dangerous jobs again, are you?

106
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,414
Of course not. Stay away.

107
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,875
If you weren't so stuck
on your sense of justice,

108
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,421
you could've held on to
your newspaper job.

109
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,179
What's wrong with trying to

110
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,474
make this country a better place
for my family to live in?

111
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,686
<i>Even now,</i>

112
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:08,691
<i>money is still necessary to support
a miserable life like this.</i>

113
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,361
If we had money, Mom could've...

114
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:19,702
- Frank, you...
- Forget it! Dammit.

115
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,236
{\an8}<i>On the 11th at 8:36 a.m.,
the subject leaves for work.</i>

116
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,289
<i>He hasn't made any suspicious</i>

117
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:10,002
<i>contact or communication with buyers
at home or during his outings.</i>

118
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,506
<i>In that case...</i>

119
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,133
<i>It must be at his workplace.</i>

120
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,932
All this mail has been inspected,
so it's ready.

121
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,017
Thanks for your hard work.

122
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:28,813
Mr. Joseph, I'll take care of it.

123
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:32,274
- Go ahead and take your lunch break.
- Thanks!

124
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,402
What should I eat today?

125
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,804
<i>He was mailing his articles
after the inspection check.</i>

126
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:07,059
<i>Once you send that,</i>

127
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,521
<i>you'll become indefensible.</i>

128
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,621
{\an8}<i>On the 15th at 8:02 a.m.</i>

129
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,669
I'm going to work.

130
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,854
State Security Service.

131
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:06,202
Sorry Dad, I might not be back
for a while.

132
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,878
Franklin Perkin.

133
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,132
You wrote this, am I correct?

134
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:28,265
We've already arrested the buyer
who you sent this to. So just give up.

135
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,019
You guys were courteous enough
to wait for me outside?

136
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,522
I never knew the Secret Police
could be so kind.

137
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,526
It's to prevent your family member
from seeing you in a pitiful state.

138
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,236
Don't get the wrong idea.

139
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:48,118
I fought against the government,
but you're just their dog.

140
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,996
I wonder who is more pitiful.

141
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,295
I will never do anything
that would cause distress to my family.

142
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,548
Never.

143
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,185
I'll submit an application so that
your father can get some assistance.

144
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,196
That'll be a big help.

145
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,204
Hey there, Yuri!

146
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:36,750
- Director!
- I heard you did a very good job!

147
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,837
- That makes this old man very happy.
- I'm honored.

148
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,591
The workload must be tough for a rookie.

149
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,343
Don't get too stressed out.

150
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:51,348
I'm okay. I think I'm suited for this job.

151
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,351
I'm going to keep up this pace,
and catch Twilight

152
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,021
to keep this country safe!

153
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,859
I see. That would be nice.

154
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,988
I'll treat you to a delicious steak
one of these days.

155
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,867
Really? I'll have you keep that promise!

156
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,919
Coming!

157
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,297
Hey, Sis!

158
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,967
- Yuri, what are you doing here so late?
- Uncle.

159
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,136
Good evening, Yuri.

160
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,639
<i>Why are you here, Loid Forger?
You should work nights too!</i>

161
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,391
Did something happen?

162
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,442
I just wanted to see your face
all of a sudden.

163
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,156
What is it, chihuahua girl?

164
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,748
You worked hard today. I'll make some tea.

165
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:08,717
<i>Sis.</i>

166
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,178
<i>Sis!</i>

167
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,932
<i>Sis!</i>

168
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:19,311
<i>- Ugh.
- Yuri, you'll disturb the neighbors.</i>

{\an8}MISSION:28

00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,627
- Leave things here to me, and go, Agent M!
- No!

172
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,714
I don't want to lose you!

173
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,637
- M.
- I'll follow you wherever you go, Bondman.

174
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,848
Let's make our escape!

175
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,642
<i>My sophisticated suit.</i>

176
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:01,145
<i>My beloved shiny silver car.</i>

177
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,648
<i>My highly-skilled techniques
and gentlemanly behavior.</i>

178
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,651
You're so cool when you drive!

179
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,196
I love you, Bondman!

180
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,074
<i>I'm super cool and clever.</i>

181
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,368
<i>So love is just inevitable.</i>

182
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,538
I'm a spy for a country that's
in a hostile relationship with yours.

183
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,667
If you get in my way, I will kill you.

184
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,587
How ridiculous.

185
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,758
We're the same species living
on the same planet.

186
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,927
Why should we fight
because of some borders?

187
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,765
If you really believe that,
why don't you stop this conflict!

188
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,145
This concludes our peace treaty!

189
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,898
There are no more walls
that can separate us!

190
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:49,777
You're amazing, Bondman!
I will never leave your side!

191
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,364
Papa is obsessed with developing bombs!

192
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,241
Please put a stop to it, Bondman!

193
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,785
Sure thing, Gina!

194
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,955
Thank you, Bondman!

195
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,625
I'll introduce you to Papa
once he wakes up.

196
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,794
I'm glad, Gina.

197
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,213
My terrorist boyfriend

198
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,716
was arrested because of you!
I'll never forgive you!

199
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,805
Revenge is futile. I'll make you
forget everything with my love.

200
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,893
The objective of our organization
is world domination!

201
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,813
Enough of that, let's go on a date.

202
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:33,070
Mr. Bondman, please pay this month's rent.

203
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,489
And the neighbors are complaining
about the noise.

204
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:38,700
You're beautiful as always, landlady.

205
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,585
- Who are all these women?
- You're a player!

206
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,420
Choose one!

207
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,423
- How many women are there?
- You're a cheater!

208
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:57,594
I will bring happiness
to every lady in this world.

209
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,027
<i>Basically, dealing with danger
is part of the job as a spy.</i>

210
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,948
Spy Wars!
<i>Next episode is, "Revival of Bondman!"</i>

211
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:21,118
I see. This is what people call
a lovey-dovey story.

212
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,163
I can talk about this with Becky.

213
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,416
- Anya is all grown up now.
- Stop it.

214
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,502
<i>When did this guy ever show
gentlemanly behavior?</i>

215
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,846
{\an8}PART C1: BONUS 1:
THE HEART OF A CHILD

216

{\an8}ON THE ROOFTOP OF A DEPARTMENT STORE

217
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,812
Anya wants to ride the polar bear.

218
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,316
<i>I don't understand
what's so entertaining about this.</i>

219
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,654
<i>This mysterious polar bear.
Why do kids want to ride on these?</i>

220
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,781
<i>It's boring and lacks stimulation.</i>

221
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,908
<i>Is it a reforming device created by</i>

222
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,868
<i>the dictatorial government to rob emotions</i>

223
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:29,746
<i>from its passengers
and make them into mere puppets?</i>

224
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,708
I want to ride it!

225
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,751
We should let her ride it, Loid.

226
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,753
{\an8}REVERSE

227
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:48,765
Was it fun?

228
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,767
I want to ride it again!

229
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,520
<i>I don't understand kids!</i>

00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,523

THE HEART OF A CHILD

231
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:01,028
<i>The Silt Beach is filled with
many beachgoers.</i>

232
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,572
Anya wants to go to the beach.

233
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,534
I can't take you to the beach,
but I can take you to a pool.

234
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,082
Pool!

235
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,171
I'm glad she's having fun.

236
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,718
{\an8}<i>Oops, I peed.</i>

237
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,137
{\an8}<i>-But I'm sure no one will know.
- Ooh, I feel relieved now.</i>

238
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,055
{\an8}BE GOOD AND DON'T IMITATE

239
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,310
I'm never going to a pool again.

240
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,521
<i>What? But she was having so much fun!</i>

241
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,565
<i>I don't understand kids.</i>

Damian.

244
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,206
You have to wake up
or you'll be late for roll call.

245
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,540
What?

246
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,629
- Damian!
- You were awake?

247
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,965
Yeah, since an hour ago. I was studying.

248
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,593
I overslept once
but that was just a one-off.

249
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,970
- I see.
- You never disappoint!

250
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:17,646
Wake up, Anya! You only have
ten minutes before the bus arrives!

251
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,981
The bomb will explode in ten seconds.

252
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,525
Anya will make sure to stop it.

253
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,360
I'm begging you! Get up!

254
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,239
You'll get a Tonito if you're
late to school too many times!

255
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,867
