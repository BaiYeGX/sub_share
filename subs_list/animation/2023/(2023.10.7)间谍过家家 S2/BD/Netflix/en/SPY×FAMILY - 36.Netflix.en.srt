<i>Vincent,</i>

00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,303
<i>I love you.</i>

00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,222
<i>This isn't right, Sonia.</i>

5
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,766
<i>I have a fiancée
I left behind in the West.</i>

6
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,685
{\an8}<i>But that's just an arranged marriage!</i>

7
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,604
{\an8}<i>I'll help you forget about her!</i>

{\an8}<i>No, we mustn't Sonia! I can't breathe...</i>

10
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,704
<i>Anya!</i>

11
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,790
<i>I'm out shopping
near your house right now,</i>

12
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,375
<i>but can I stop by your place?</i>

13
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:07,752
<i>I can? Great, thank you! I'll be there!</i>

14
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,505
Good day, Anya!

15
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,383
Please tell me you're not home alone!

16
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,011
Becky, are you
the teleporting Shashasha-man?

17
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,974
<i>I will definitely meet Mr. Loid today</i>

18
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,184
<i>and ask him to go out with me.</i>

19
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,895
<i>Miss, you must not have an affair.</i>

20
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,774
Father, Becky is here.

21
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,443
Hey, welcome.

22
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,321
<i>It's Mr. Loid in the flesh!</i>

23
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,576
Miss, you mustn't forget your greetings.

24
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,995
Um... um...

25
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:45,165
Hello. Thank you for having me...

26
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,127
Sorry for visiting unannounced,
Mr. Forger.

27
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,504
No problem at all.

28
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:55,341
My daughter's happy
to have her friend stop by for a visit.

29
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,719
Hello, Miss Becky.

30
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,012
<i>Miss Becky...</i>

31
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,347
<i>- Miss Becky...
- Lo...</i>

32
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,684
Thanks for always being so good
to my daughter.

33
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:10,315
<i>A star, hashtag, triangle, ampersand,
smiley face, hot spring, heart...</i>

34
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,317
<i>Is this a code?</i>

35
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:17,739
Miss, please get up.

36
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:21,326
It's bad manners to lie down on the ground
in someone else's house.

37
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,161
<i>I love you.</i>

38
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:27,081
<i>I remember seeing
someone like this before.</i>

39
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,499
LOVE

40
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,920
Please behave well, Miss.

41
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,172
I'll be back to pick you up.

42
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,423
Okay.

43
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,593
Thank you for looking after her.

44
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,553
Sure.

45
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,227
<i>The way she carries herself tells me</i>

46
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,604
<i>that she's a former experienced soldier.</i>

47
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,272
<i>It's the Blackbell family after all.</i>

48
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,611
Do you want to explore Anya's house?

49
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,530
Come to think of it,
it's my first time inside.

50
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,783
This is the living room.

51
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,827
What? I thought this was the storage area
by the entrance!

52
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,582
This is Anya's room!

53
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,835
Oh my, it's much smaller
than my Wiesel's doghouse.

54
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,212
Isn't it suffocating?

55
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,131
Let's quit exploring.

56
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,800
If you want.

57
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,886
By the way, where's Mrs. Forger?

58
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,763
Mother took Bond on a walk.

59
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,265
<i>This is my chance!</i>

60
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:28,309
Mr. Loid!

61
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,020
This isn't right, Miss Becky.
I have a wife.

62
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,690
It was an arranged marriage, right?

63
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,358
UNFOUNDED

64
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:36,859
But...

65
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,029
I'll use my charms to help you forget
about her!

66
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,448
Miss Becky!

67
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,711
<i>Becky as my mom?!</i>

68
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,090
<i>I'm sure it will make Anya happy
if I become her mother.</i>

69
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,302
Let's live in this spacious house.

70
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,594
It's a castle!

71
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,307
Come Anya, let's go to school together
in my helicopter.

72
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,474
Mother!

73
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,060
A first-rate chef will prepare our meals
every day.

74
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,979
- Delicious!
- Yummy!

75
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,399
The servants will take care of
all the tiresome chores.

76
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,609
Let's go out and play.

77
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:19,861
Yay!

78
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,742
<i>It's not bad!</i>

79
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,744
<i>Sorry, Mother.</i>

80
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,831
<i>I'm leaning more towards Becky
because of the first-rate chef.</i>

81
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,335
Father! Come play with us.

82
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,588
<i>Nice assist, Anya!</i>

83
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,132
Play with you guys?

84
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,968
We can just talk if you'd like.

85
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:49,932
Oh... um... ah... I'm Becky Blackbell.

86
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,685
Yes, I'm aware of that.

87
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,481
<i>First-rate chef! First-rate chef!</i>

88
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,400
The Blackbell family is very famous.

89
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,737
I already knew about you
before you became Anya's classmate.

90
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,947
<i>As an important source of intel.</i>

91
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,949
<i>He knew about me from long ago?</i>

92
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,287
<i>I've already secured a few outlets
to gain intel from Blackbell,</i>

93
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,082
<i>but I might be able to get something
out of the daughter.</i>

94
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,416
<i>It's worth trying.</i>

95
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,294
<i>Father is always thinking about work.</i>

96
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,088
How is your father doing?

97
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:23,633
<i>I hear he's been busy restructuring
his business.</i>

98
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,550
<i>Ah...</i>

99
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,011
<i>Yes, but Papa is really nice,</i>

100
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,263
<i>so he plays with me on his days off.</i>

101
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,974
We went to the movies the other day.

102
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,935
<i>Next time, I want to go with you.</i>

103
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,187
I see. What did you watch?

104
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,481
Was it that movie theater along the river?

105
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,234
There are lots of great restaurants
around there.

106
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,028
<i>Her father's time off.</i>

107
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,447
<i>Area of activity, habits,
and food preferences.</i>

108
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,366
<i>There's countless useful information.</i>

109
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,204
The movie was a love story...

110
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,541
<i>Is he trying to gauge my preferences?</i>

111
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,959
<i>Even the restaurants?</i>

112
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,086
<i>Wait, is he asking me out to eat? Is he?</i>

113
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,879
You must be close with your father.

114
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,132
Do you go out with your family often?

115
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,676
Do you play together at home too?

116
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,885
<i>Currently,</i>

117
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:11,389
<i>nothing suggests that Blackbell Industries
is taking part in planning a war.</i>

118
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:15,017
<i>But it won't hurt to gather intel while
taking future possibilities into account.</i>

119
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,478
Pa... Papa likes chess.

120
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,606
I have no idea how to play it,
but I always have to play against him.

121
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,067
Oh... and...

122
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,237
<i>I didn't think he'd express such interest
in my family!</i>

123
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,488
<i>Mr. Loid, are you...</i>

124
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,700
<i>thinking of me as someone
to share your future with?</i>

125
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,953
<i>He looks somewhat serious!</i>

126
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,997
<i>This is fun.</i>

127
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,333
We're back.

128
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,546
Oh? Welcome, Becky!

129
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,591
<i>She's here! The last boss!</i>

130
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,676
<i>- Right when Mr. Loid started</i>
- First-rate chef!

131
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,011
<i>- expressing interest in me!</i>
- First-rate chef!

132
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,724
Hello, Mrs. Forger.

133
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,142
Oh my, how cute.

134
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,061
Look Becky, this is Bond!

135
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,108
<i>Mr. Loid's heart is leaning towards me
right now!</i>

136
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,319
- Look Becky!
<i>- You're so close, Becky!</i>

137
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,738
<i>You have to give it your all right now!</i>

138
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,992
<i>I'll use everything I learned
from the drama!</i>

139
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,953
Loid,

140
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:18,581
I bought the ingredients for dinner.

141
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,333
Thanks, Yor.

142
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,544
<i>Is she trying to show off
her competence as a wife?</i>

143
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:24,962
<i>How naive.</i>

144
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,216
<i>You can't move Mr. Loid's heart
with something trivial like that.</i>

145
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:31,093
<i>Father and Mother are already married.</i>

146
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,472
<i>Jonathan in</i> Berlint in Love <i>said</i>

147
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,976
<i>that even after marriage, a man wants
his mate to maintain her womanly appeal.</i>

148
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,396
Hm?

149
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,857
<i>What? His reaction is a bit dull.</i>

150
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,817
<i>Maybe I needed to glance upwards
a bit more.</i>

151
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,779
<i>Tommy said that it's sexy
whenever girls tie</i>

152
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,572
<i>and untie their hair.</i>

153
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,418
Becky must be really happy
because she's been wanting

154
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:08,130
to see you for a very long time, Loid.
Is she expressing her happiness?

155
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,632
Oh... hm.

156
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,720
I brought some tea.

157
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:18,641
Loid, why don't you sit over there
on the couch?

158
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,647
<i>Mr. Loid is sitting next to me!
He's next to me!</i>

159
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,445
<i>Mrs. Forger must be crazy.
Why is she aiding her enemy?</i>

160
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,032
<i>She must have accepted her defeat
after seeing me flip my hair.</i>

161
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,285
<i>This is your chance, Becky!
Go in for the kill!</i>

162
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,246
<i>It seems like she's ill...</i>

163
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,916
Um... Mr. Loid, let's continue
with our discussion from earlier...

164
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:48,170
You were showing interest in my family.

165
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,255
<i>How formal.</i>

166
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,218
Oh sorry, I didn't mean to pry. I was just
curious since your family is so famous.

167
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,638
<i>Oh crap. Maybe I went too far,
thinking that she's just a child.</i>

168
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,267
What? You were just playing with me?

169
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,356
What are you saying?

170
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,234
<i>Yor will get the wrong idea.</i>

171
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,445
<i>Oh, Loid is so impressive.</i>

172
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,698
<i>He was playing with Becky
while I was away?</i>

173
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,741
<i>He's so nice!</i>

174
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:21,704
<i>Look at Mrs. Forger's smile!
She must be confident she beat me!</i>

175
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,998
<i>You really think I don't have a chance
with Mr. Loid?</i>

176
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,958
<i>I'm going to lose the first-rate chef.</i>

177
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,252
<i>It's time to go for broke!</i>

178
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:31,672
<i>It's the tactic Penelope used on Tommy!</i>

179
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,136
I think I'm a little drunk.

180
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,681
<i>It's just tea.</i>

181
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,808
<i>According to</i> Berlint in Love,

182
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,686
<i>this is the prohibited technique
to make any man fall for you!</i>

183
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,190
<i>There's no turning back now!
The fight is on, Mrs. Forger!</i>

184
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,362
Yor, don't misunderstand...

185
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,279
Oh no!

186
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,240
Did I serve alcohol to a child?

187
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,283
What should I do?

188
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,618
No, this is just tea.

189
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,079
Perhaps the tea leaves were
fermented too long...

190
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,040
What?

191
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,416
Let's go to the hospital!

192
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,542
Wait!

193
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,670
Yor!

194
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,798
Are you okay, Becky?

195
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,091
Do you feel nauseous?

196
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,802
I'm okay! So put me down!

197
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:21,013
Acute alcohol poisoning
shouldn't be underestimated!

198
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,723
It's not about that!

199
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,150
Which doctor should I take her to?

200
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,152
Let's go to the emergency room!

201
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,992
We'll be there soon! Stay awake!

202
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,911
Don't fall asleep! You'll die!

203
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,454
You're thinking of something else.

204
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,208
Don't forget to breathe!

205
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,626
That's something else too.

206
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,296
Wait, Mrs. Forger.
You've got it all wrong.

207
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,049
I lied because I wanted to go out
with Mr. Loid.

208
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,467
I'm not drunk!

209
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,552
What?

210
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,472
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

211
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,476
I'm so glad you're okay.

212
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,311
What?

213
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,105
Can you stand?

214
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,941
You're not going to get mad at me?

215
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,235
Why would I? You're safe and well.

216
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,904
Oh well, there's the thing
with Mr. Loid too...

217
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:23,742
It makes me happy to know that Loid
is loved.

218
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,744
He is a lovely person after all.

219
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,037
<i>Oh my!</i>

220
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,707
<i>She's so broad-minded!</i>

221
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,250
<i>She's okay with affairs?</i>

222
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,794
I should be the one to apologize.

223
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,255
I misunderstood and dragged you out here.

224
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,632
No, it's my fault.

225
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,636
Compared to Loid, I'm so useless.

226
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:47,141
But Mr. Loid chose you!

227
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,896
How did you shoot and capture
Mr. Loid's heart? I'm so curious!

228
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,315
Shoot and capture...

229
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,400
No, I didn't shoot Loid at all!

230
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,528
I don't use bows and arrows to begin with!

231
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:09,413
Loid chose me because...

232
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,416
<i>I can't say that it was because
we matched each other's requirements.</i>

233
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:17,004
<i>I only remember vaguely,
but one time he told me,</i>

234
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:18,964
"Because you're strong."

235
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,799
Because you're strong?

236
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,802
<i>Mr. Loid likes strong women?</i>

237
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:27,431
<i>Come to think of it,
Mrs. Forger is very strong! And tough!</i>

238
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,807
Hey!

239
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,226
There they are!

240
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,435
Becky!

241
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,941
Becky, you forgot your bag.

242
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,238
<i>Mr. Loid, did you come running after me
because you were worried?</i>

243
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,697
Your bag.

244
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,865
<i>I'm strong.</i>

245
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,701
<i>I have to show him how strong I am!</i>

246
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,036
<i>How can I do that?</i>

247
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,955
<i>That's it!</i>

248
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:56,377
Oh, I have the sudden urge
to hit something with a hammer.

249
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,047
<i>What kind of urge is that?
I don't understand rich kids at all.</i>

250
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,968
Sir, can I try this?

251
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:07,346
What? You have any money, Missy?

252
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:13,310
Chef!

253
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,105
- Let's do this!
- Chef!

254
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,023
Chef!

255
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,484
You give up?

256
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,778
<i>I'm a weak woman.</i>

257
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,364
<i>I'm a weak, worthless woman.</i>

258
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,991
Are you all right?

259
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,494
At this rate,
I will never catch Mr. Loid's attention.

260
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,207
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

261
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,377
<i>Becky probably wanted to give
the grand prize to Loid as a gift.</i>

262
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,963
Let me try it one time.

263
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:44,967
All right.

264
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:52,558
<i>Grand prize!</i>

265
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,560
- Oh... yay...
<i>- Grand prize!</i>

266
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,478
<i>I should've held back a little more.</i>

267
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,273
<i>This is the meaning of strength.</i>

268
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,485
<i>Mr. Loid is staring at his wife!</i>

269
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,822
<i>So it's true that you like
strong women, huh?</i>

270
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:08,991
Yor...

271
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,534
It's not what you think, Loid!

272
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,579
I once trained under
a professional hammer wielder!

273
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,623
<i>Those rounded eyes!</i>

274
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,833
<i>That's definitely the look of love!</i>

275
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,046
I'm no match for you, Mrs. Forger.

276
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,047
What?

277
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:27,009
You have the mind and heart as broad
as the sky, and the strength of the earth!

278
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,345
You're the perfect lady.

279
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,473
Please be my master and teach me the way!

280
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,975
I want to become strong like you!

281
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,937
L... like me?

282
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:43,067
Okay! Let's train together!

283
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,610
Okay, Mrs. Forger!

284
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,572
<i>And someday I will win over Mr. Loid...</i>

285
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,578
<i>I'm here to pick up Miss Becky.</i>

286
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,788
Ya!

287
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,082
That's not right, Becky.

288
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,584
You must twist your hips a little more.
Like this!

289
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,044
Ya!

290
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,046
- Ya!
- Ya!

291
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,589
- Is this a déjà vu?
- Ya!

292
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,425
- My mother is more fun after all.
- Ya!

293
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,844
BERLINT GENERAL HOSPITAL
THURSDAY

294
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,765
{\an8}Doctor Forger, you'll be on vacation
starting tomorrow, right?

295
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:16,684
{\an8}Sorry for the inconvenience.

296
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,853
{\an8}No, you're a workaholic,
so you need this vacation.

297
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,814
Relax and have fun.

298
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:26,110
I'm so envious. Please tell us all about
your trip when you return!

299
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,238
Will do. Thank you.

300
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,742
Thank you for dealing with
any inconveniences while I'm gone.

301
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,786
{\an8}WISE SAFEHOUSE G

302
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,123
That's the summary of
the mission this time.

303
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,166
Any questions?

304
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,168
No.

305
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,921
I'm counting on you, Nightfall.

306
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,756
Oh, and one more thing.

307
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,134
Look through this.

308
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,725
I was planning on giving these missions
to Twilight after his vacation.

309
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,268
But plans have changed.

310
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,355
Sorry, but this is urgent.
Can you take on a few of them?

311
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,233
Of course I'll assign some
to the other agents too.

312
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,611
No, I can do it all on my own.

313
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,951
I'm glad you're willing, but you have
your own current mission as well.

314
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,496
I don't want my agents to get exhausted
by overworking themselves.

315
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:24,626
But I highly doubt there is anyone else
besides me who can complete these tasks.

316
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,715
Fine. But don't push yourself too hard.

317
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:43,020
<i>Agent Twilight, WISE's most skilled spy.</i>

318
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,989
<i>Missions assigned to a skilled spy
such as him,</i>

319
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,575
<i>are anything but easy to accomplish.</i>

320
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:02,581
<i>But this will be a big opportunity for me.</i>

321
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:27,523
<i>Twilight taught me many valuable things.</i>

322
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,860
<i>Like the skills necessary to be a spy,
and fighting techniques.</i>

323
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:37,032
<i>I will make full use of all that I was
taught and complete this mission.</i>

324
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,163
<i>And...</i>

325
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,375
<i>after I perfectly complete my mission...</i>

326
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,191
<i>I will take the place as his wife...</i>

327
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,700
<i>All right. I'm sure this will
make him realize</i>

328
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,828
<i>that I'm most suited to be his partner.</i>

329
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,167
<i>But...</i>

330
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,879
<i>this is not enough.</i>

331
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:35,340
<i>It's not enough for me to be certain
of my victory</i>

332
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,759
<i>against Yor Briar.</i>

333
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,889
<i>I need to do more
in order to become Mrs. Forger.</i>

334
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:48,770
<i>More...</i>

335
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,484
<i>More...</i>

336
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:03,493
MONDAY MORNING

337
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,164
Those are the files I put together
of your patients while you were away.

338
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,290
This is helpful.

339
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,585
<i>I missed seeing him
the last three days. Love you.</i>

340
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:14,171
- How was your vacation?
<i>- Did you find any major faults?</i>

341
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,173
- Anything out of the ordinary?
<i>- Concerning your wife for Operation Strix?</i>

342
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,801
<i>There was back-breaking work to deal with</i>

343
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,012
<i>like Anya's tantrums
and a potential bombing.</i>

344
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:24,473
No, nothing in particular.

345
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,557
I see.

346
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,475
<i>Dammit.</i>

347
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,810
How about you?

348
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,355
Anything out of the ordinary
while I was away?

349
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,942
<i>I worked hard on missions
because I wanted to be useful to you.</i>

350
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,486
<i>Next time, I will make sure
to win against that woman.</i>

351
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,780
<i>So please choose me
for the role of your wife.</i>

352
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,365
No, nothing in particular.

353
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,075
I see.

354
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,246
Nightfall said that?

355
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,914
Yeah.

356
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,917
She was fired up and told me to leave it
all up to her.

357
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,628
She impressively completed the work.

358
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,966
<i>I can't believe Nightfall covered my work.</i>

359
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,301
<i>Even when she had her own mission
to complete.</i>

360
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,512
SOUVENIRS

361
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,557
By the way, I passed out souvenirs
to everyone, and there's one left.

362
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,850
Would you like it?

363
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,610
<i>She's glaring at me!</i>

364
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,612
<i>What? What does this mean?</i>

365
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,906
Thank you.

366
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,741
Excuse me.

367
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,953
Oh...

368
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:39,339
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

369
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,800
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

370
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,510
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I thought it was now or never.

371
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,803
So I said it.

372
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,931
- I see.
- Oh, Ms. Fiona!

373
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,975
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

374
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,861
LOVE

375
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,668
{\an8}MISSION:37
PART OF THE FAMILY
