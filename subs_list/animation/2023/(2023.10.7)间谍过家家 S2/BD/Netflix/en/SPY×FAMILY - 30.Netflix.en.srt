1
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:16,391
Thank you for coming, Thorn Princess.

2
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:26,943
Hello. The garden is
as beautiful as always.

3
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:30,155
- Shopkeeper.
- It is, isn't it?

4
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,160
With proper watering,
pruning, and meticulous care,

5
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:40,165
the world can maintain
its beauty just like this.

6
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,169
Welcome, Thorn Princess.

7
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,547
The heather smells wonderful!

8
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:52,093
The leaves of the burning bush
are vibrant too. Look.

9
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,646
You surprised me!

10
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:09,444
Pardon me. I was worried that having
a family may have dulled your senses.

11
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,446
But it seems like you have not changed.

12
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:14,449
I can now entrust you with our new client
with confidence.

13
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:18,453
Please do! I will gladly
get rid of the bad guys anytime you wish!

14
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,956
How reassuring. But...

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,210
your assignment this time
is to protect the client.

16
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,503
Protect?

17
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,153
{\an8}ORIGINAL WORK BY TATSUYA ENDO
SERIALIZED ON SHUEISHA'S SHONEN JUMP PLUS

18
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,474
{\an8}Do you know of the Gretcher family?

19
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,434
{\an8}MISSION:30
PLAN TO CROSS THE BORDER

20
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:07,770
{\an8}For generations, they have been
a great force, running this country's

21
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,230
underworld in an honorable way.

22
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:12,150
Due to an internal conflict,

23
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,153
their boss and his two sons
were recently killed.

24
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,739
The only surviving members
of the Gretcher family

25
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,242
are Olka Gretcher and her son.

26
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,953
Currently, they're taking shelter
at a hideout,

27
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,872
<i>but the man who took over
the organization,</i>

28
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,417
<i>Leonardo Hapoon, is in a frenzy
searching for them.</i>

29
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,252
<i>He put a huge bounty on their heads,</i>

30
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,756
<i>and according to rumors, assassins
all over the world are on the move.</i>

31
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:40,637
We have agreed to help her seek asylum
in a foreign country.

32
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,263
Our escape route is the sea.

33
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,766
<i>In order to go unnoticed
by the coast guards,</i>

34
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,518
<i>they'll travel as passengers
until the ship is offshore.</i>

35
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,271
<i>Then we'll rendezvous with a ship
heading to their destination.</i>

36
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:55,526
I want you to stay by their side
until they're safely handed over.

37
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:59,739
I'm to protect these mafia family members
from assassins.

38
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:03,993
It would be best if all goes as planned
without encountering any enemies.

39
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,995
You'll be there
just in case anything happens.

40
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,458
I was indebted to the boss
who was regrettably killed.

41
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,418
So please accept this job.

42
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,214
But what about my work at the city hall?

43
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,594
And if I'll be away for a few days, I have
to think of an excuse to say to my family.

44
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,180
Don't worry about that.

45
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,557
I had them come up with a bogus plan
to have you

46
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,935
travel as part
of your work for the city hall.

47
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,604
The director will fill you in
on the details later on.

48
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,483
I'm counting on you, Thorn Princess.

49
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,611
To keep this world a beautiful place.

50
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,282
I understand. I will do my best!

51
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,876
<i>It's my first job in a long time.
I have to give it my best.</i>

52
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,131
- Yuri!
- Sis!

53
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,719
I didn't expect to run into you
on this train.

54
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,555
Oh yeah... I'm returning
from a business trip.

55
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,765
<i>I was arresting a political prisoner.</i>

56
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,269
- Good work. You want to come over to eat?
- Really?

57
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,480
Oh... never mind.

58
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:17,692
Lotty's waiting for you,
and I still have work left to do.

59
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,193
<i>Like organizing wiretapping data.</i>

60
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:22,113
When will you become friendlier with Loid?

61
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:25,199
- Never.
- Are you eating well?

62
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,368
Make sure you don't leave
your socks lying around.

63
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,372
Sis, I'm not a little kid anymore.

64
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,710
Right. You're right.

65
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,378
<i>Forg Square.</i>

66
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:41,174
I can't be dependent on you forever.

67
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,717
Although I did the other day.

68
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,346
Make sure you rely on me
when you need help, Sis.

69
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,974
<i>I'll kill Lotty for you in a second.</i>

70
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:50,892
See you.

71
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:00,818
Sis!

72
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,448
<i>Yuri is all grown up now.</i>

73
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,450
<i>That's right.</i>

74
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,162
<i>He has a job now,
and he's able to support himself.</i>

75
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,998
<i>He doesn't need my help anymore.</i>

76
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,878
<i>Is there a reason for me
to continue this job</i>

77
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,505
<i>as an assassin?</i>

78
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,759
{\an8}Oh, what a shame!
Seventh place is a scrubby brush!

79
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:25,885
Dammit.

80
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:29,555
Come on, everyone!
It's Central Mall's biannual mega raffle!

81
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,892
Get one raffle ticket for every
30 dalc you spend!

82
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:37,396
The grand prize is two tickets
for a voyage on a cruise ship.

83
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,899
Come and try your luck!

84
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:41,984
Father,

85
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:46,447
Anya wants to get on that ship
and go on a big adventure.

86
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,907
I see. How brave of you.

87
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,327
Give tickets to this brave hero.

88
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,204
I only have one ticket.

89
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,999
Oh, a shame!
Sixth place is a luxurious scrubby brush!

90
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,837
What the hell?
Is the grand prize really in there?

91
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,756
The grand prize is still available.

92
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:09,971
<i>Bunch of idiots. Keep spending money
for the grand prize you'll never get!</i>

93
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,223
<i>This cruise trip is mine!</i>

94
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,475
<i>I even made preparations beforehand.</i>

95
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,562
<i>I know.
We have to pretend we're strangers.</i>

96
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,899
<i>The grand prize ticket is glued
to the top of the box.</i>

97
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,110
<i>No one else will ever get it.</i>

98
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,863
<i>It's my privilege as an employee here!</i>

99
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,866
<i>I can't wait for us
to go on this trip, Cindy!</i>

100
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:34,078
<i>I'm not that interested in a cruise,
but I guess I'll go if it's free.</i>

101
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,707
Hey there little girl. It's your turn.

102
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,084
Here you go. I hope you win!

103
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,254
<i>Hurry up and draw a blank,
you little brat.</i>

104
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:46,591
<i>The lady behind you
is going to win the grand prize.</i>

105
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:59,353
- We've got a winner!
- How?!

106
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,277
Loid and Anya, I'm back.

107
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,488
Listen to this, Mother!

108
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,405
{\an8}LUXURY CRUISE

109
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,491
{\an8}Anya won a trip on a cruise!

110
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:15,912
- What?
- She won the grand prize at a raffle.

111
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,829
Amazing!

112
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,041
<i>It's too good to be true.
I almost suspect a trap.</i>

113
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:22,335
<i>Father is suspicious of everything.</i>

114
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,796
It's a ticket for two,
so would you like to go with her, Yor?

115
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,964
I have work, after all.

116
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,218
I'm super excited because I've never
been to the ocean before!

117
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:32,970
Bond, you're staying home.

118
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,766
Princess Lorelei cruise?

119
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,268
I'll be going on this cruise ship
for work!

120
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,064
- What?
- And this also departs on Friday.

121
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,234
- You're going on a ship for work?
- Yes, um...

122
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,736
The city is trying to invite
a famous department store,

123
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,072
so we're entertaining their VIP.

124
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,867
I see. It must be a part of
the recent urban development.

125
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:58,829
<i>In reality, I have a job to protect
important people from assassins.</i>

126
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,832
<i>This job is a battle of assassins!</i>

127
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,878
<i>If by chance, they both get on this ship,</i>

128
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,340
<i>it will be difficult for me to do my job.</i>

129
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,758
<i>What should I do?</i>

130
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,055
<i>Don't make things difficult for Mother.
Cancel your excur-gen.</i>

131
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,016
<i>Why should I care?
I want to cruise the ocean.</i>

132
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,394
<i>Deep down, you agree with me too.</i>

133
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:26,899
<i>You're right. I might be able to kill
two birds with one stone if I help Mother.</i>

134
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,238
<i>Be honest with yourself.
You've been wanting to go out to sea.</i>

135
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:39,161
Anya wants to go on a ship!
If I can't, I'll turn into a delinquent!

136
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,121
Oh boy.

137
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,667
I'll go to work tomorrow
and see if I can take some time off.

138
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,421
No problem at all.

139
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,216
I'll make arrangements so you can
take time off from the hospital.

140
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,635
Thank you.

141
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,722
{\an8}<i>Stop fooling around.
Work until you're worn thin!</i>

142
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,019
There's talk that she got scolded
by the main office for overworking us.

143
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,023
Caring for Anya's needs and education
is part of Operation Strix.

144
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,026
Agent Twilight,

145
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:13,779
go and successfully complete the mission
of rest and time off.

146
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,453
Excur-gen, excur-gen!

147
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:24,081
{\an8}It's been so long since we've been on
an excur-gen as a family!

148
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:27,418
{\an8}Yes, although I'll be working.

149
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,756
- Be careful.
<i>- If only I wasn't assigned this job.</i>

150
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,508
<i>Then the three of us could've enjoyed
a family vacation.</i>

151
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,137
<i>What am I saying!</i>

152
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,181
<i>I'm misplacing my priorities!</i>

153
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,557
What's wrong, Mother?

154
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,560
That's our station!

155
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,063
<i>But if I make this...</i>

156
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,566
<i>my last job as Thorn Princess...</i>

157
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,216
It's so big!

158
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,220
- I'm so excited!
- Calm down.

159
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:25,226
I'll be going now to meet up
with the people from city hall.

160
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,978
I'll contact you whenever I can.

161
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,648
{\an8}I'm sorry to be having fun on our own.

162
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,024
{\an8}Good luck, Mother!

163
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,098
Pool! Circus!

164
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,059
Games room! And...

165
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,856
Ocean!

166
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,234
Father, this ship is amazing!
I can sense a great adventure!

167
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:18,362
Well, it's a luxury liner built
to honorably represent Ostania.

168
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:21,991
- Let's go explore!
- After we leave our luggage in our room.

169
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,493
I can't wait for the suite room!

170
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,628
It seems like I stepped into
a prison cell by mistake. Wrong room.

171
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,756
It's the correct room.
This is what a third-class cabin is like.

172
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,136
Please wait until next time to enjoy
Anya's adventure.

173
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,014
You won this free trip at a raffle.
Don't be too picky.

174
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,516
This is Anya's first time
sleeping on a bunk bed!

175
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,769
- I'm gonna take the top bunk!
- Go ahead. Don't fall.

176
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,689
Yor and her co-workers
must be in the first-class cabin.

177
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:58,110
- That's not fair! Mother is living it up.
- Well, she has to entertain guests.

178
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,779
Allow me to introduce myself.

179
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:05,201
I'm Matthew McMahon, the Director
of Policy at Berlint City Hall.

180
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,037
This is Heymann and Vides
from the Business Development Team.

181
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,872
And this is Forger.

182
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,461
Furseal Grey from Development Department
at Arhaus Department Stores.

183
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,921
This is my wife, Shaty.

184
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:21,050
- Sorry for bringing along our child.
- No problem. Enjoy your family trip.

185
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,385
Any female assistance you require.

186
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,555
- Please ask Forger.
- Thank you.

187
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,309
<i>She's Ms. Olka from the Gretcher family.</i>

188
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,561
<i>She's so different from her picture.</i>

189
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,814
<i>She must have changed her appearance.</i>
Nice to meet you.

190
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,609
It's nice to meet you.
<i>So this is Olka's guard?</i>

191
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:40,819
<i>She looks frail, but will she be okay?</i>

192
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,614
<i>This Princess Lorelei cruise</i>

193
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:47,284
<i>is a short two-night, three-day voyage
that tours around the near-by islands.</i>

194
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,329
<i>We hope the Grey family will be able to
enjoy a relaxing trip.</i>

195
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,206
It's nothing compared to your

196
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:55,376
department stores, but there is
a shopping mall on this ship as well.

197
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,044
Would you like a tour?

198
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,089
<i>These two are actual personnel
who know nothing about us.</i>

199
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,050
- Sure, thanks.
- I'll decline.

200
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,928
- I'll stay here and look after my baby.
- Okay.

201
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,055
Then I'll leave Forger here with you.

202
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,643
- This way, Mr. Grey.
- But, um...

203
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,107
Will she be okay with just one guard?

204
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,608
Shouldn't we all stick together?

205
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,862
She'll be safe as long as she stays
inside the room.

206
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,114
We'll first inspect the ship.

207
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,657
Please rest assured.

208
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,076
<i>She's very strong.</i>

209
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:38,210
Your job this time is to protect
Olka and her son.

210
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:43,173
<i>We've learned that there are
numerous assassins out to get them.</i>

211
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,342
<i>If need be, please get rid of the enemies.</i>

212
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,178
<i>I'm counting on you, Thorn Princess.</i>

213
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,807
<i>All the entry and escape routes
have been checked beforehand.</i>

214
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,101
<i>But I can't rest assured
until I confirm it myself.</i>

215
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,229
<i>Although I'm sure
the Director checked it himself.</i>

216
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,484
You're really in that line of work, huh?

217
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:04,320
Oh? Yes.

218
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,321
Which line of work?

219
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,075
You're Ms. Olka, right?

220
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,580
Yes. Although I rather not be called
by that name while on this ship.

221
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,165
I apologize!

222
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:19,460
- Mama!
- Oh no, he woke up.

223
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,587
I'm so sorry!

224
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,006
Mama!

225
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,551
Isn't it funny?

226
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,765
Even though I changed my appearance,
he still knows that I'm his mother.

227
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:37,269
Perhaps it's my voice or my scent,
or because his vision isn't fully formed.

228
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,271
It makes me a little sad that no one

229
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:44,443
will ever say that we look alike.
But I don't care about that now.

230
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:48,072
He took after his dad,
so I guess it doesn't matter either way.

231
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,659
Your husband was a very nice man.

232
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,620
<i>Oh, he's just a member of our crew.</i>

233
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,540
<i>He's just playing a part.
But he's a nice guy, nonetheless.</i>

234
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,419
My husband was killed along
with my father and brothers.

235
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,632
That's why my son is all that I have left.

236
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,718
I'm sorry... I had no idea.

237
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,930
It's okay. It's the fate of being born
into a gangster family.

238
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,392
But I'm tired of it.

239
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,811
I don't need the name or the inheritance.

240
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,563
I just want to live a quiet life.

241
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,949
It's okay. What's wrong?

242
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,457
Ms. Bodyguard, can I ask you for a favor?

243
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,671
Ever since the dispute began,
I've been forced to stay hidden.

244
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,215
I want to spread my wings a little.

245
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,052
I want to let him enjoy
the outside air as well.

246
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,639
But um... we need the Director's permission...

247
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:57,558
Please. Just for a little while.

248
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,227
My enemies don't know
what I look like now.

249
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,981
<i>And they don't know that I'm on this ship
to begin with.</i>

250
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,985
Plus, if anything happens,
you'll be here to protect me, right?

251
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,782
I understand. Just for a little while.

252
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,708
Wouldn't you attract more attention
with that behavior?

253
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,336
Well, it's true that I'm watching out
for the bad guys...

254
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,380
But...

255
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,760
<i>- Your family is also on this ship?
- Yes.</i>

256
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:35,012
<i>My husband and daughter.</i>

257
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:39,099
Father, we need to hurry up and finish
exploring, or this ship will sink.

258
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,018
It won't sink! Watch what you say!

259
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,187
<i>But really,</i>

260
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:48,358
<i>this ship is unbelievably large. It seems
like famous people are on board too.</i>

261
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,527
<i>I should prepare for
a possible terrorist attack,</i>

262
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:54,031
<i>and look out for suspicious people,
and check the configuration of this ship.</i>

263
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,909
<i>I must be aware of when and where
certain people gather...</i>

264
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,369
Father isn't having fun.

265
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,246
<i>Oh crap. Old habits die hard!</i>

266
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,625
<i>Successfully complete the mission
of rest and time off.</i>

267
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,879
<i>I must rest! I need to do my best
and make full use of this time off!</i>

268
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:12,257
- Let's go watch a show!
- Father is so serious.

269
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,304
Why did you even bring them here?

270
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,349
Well, it all happened by accident.

271
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,018
My family doesn't know
about this line of work.

272
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:27,856
So if fighting ever erupts,
and they see me, it would be trouble...

273
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,401
Well, it'd be trouble if other passengers
were to see me too.

274
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,070
If they're in the third-class cabin,

275
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:37,533
we won't bump into them
if we stay in the first-class area.

276
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,785
That's true, but...

277
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:45,124
You're really concerned about this.
Your family is just for your cover, right?

278
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,586
Yes... you're right...

279
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,966
I guess you're right...

280
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,683
That's right! Let's go outside right away!

281
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:04,768
Wait.

282
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,106
I'll let you borrow this.

283
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,783
It feels amazing.

284
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,790
This is...

285
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,294
Now we look like two mothers
here on vacation.

286
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:33,797
It's better than your suit.
Even if your husband were to

287
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,176
see you from far away,
he won't be able to tell it's you.

288
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,927
You're right.

289
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,144
What a calm breeze.

290
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:54,651
There's no sign of land in sight.

291
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,738
You're right.

292
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,328
I left so many things behind.

293
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,794
Oh, is he getting cold?

294
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,922
Let's head back.

295
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,092
Um... Ms. Shaty.

296
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:25,349
I will do my best!
I will protect you both,

297
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:28,268
and carry out my duty!

298
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:33,023
- Besht.
- Yes! I will do my "besht"!

299
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,360
Gram.

300
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,823
That's his name.
The same name as my father.

301
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,618
- That's his real name.
- Gam.

302
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,957
Nice to meet you, Gram.

303
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,253
- Want to hold him on the way back?
- May I?

304
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,255
<i>I'll be careful not to break his bones.</i>

305
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,634
I'm sorry! Here, take him back, Ms. Shaty!

306
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,097
- Where's the bathroom?
- The show's at five.

307
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,182
- Let's go to the bar.
- Wow!

308
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,684
- I can go shopping!
- Dad!

309
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,270
What is it? Don't go too far.

310
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,523
- I will win the next election for sure.
- No, those stocks are...

311
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:18,026
Oh man, I hear the lock
to the emergency door is broken.

312
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,238
<i>- I was about to be left behind.
- Next time for sure...</i>

313
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,864
<i>This is delicious.</i>

314
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,243
<i>- Company A's product is...
- Therefore...</i>

315
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,620
<i>- E-226, all clear.
- Oh, seriously...</i>

316
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:33,375
<i>Gram... His name...</i>

317
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,752
<i>The same name as my father.</i>

318
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,463
<i>Where should we go tomorrow?</i>

319
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,757
<i>Nice to meet you, Gram.</i>

320
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,761
<i>I'm sorry! Here, take him back, Ms. Shaty!</i>

321
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,264
Shaty... Shaty...

322
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:51,518
Shaty Hutton. Room 2125.

323
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,271
Shaty Copeland. Room 3064.

324
00:21:55,731 --> 00:22:00,110
Shaty Grey. Room 8053.
