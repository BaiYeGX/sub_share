<i>Yor's other identity</i>

00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:07,757
<i>is Thorn Princess.</i>

3
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:10,760
Your mission this time is to protect.

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>In order to protect a VIP mafia member
seeking asylum,</i>

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,142
<i>a plan was set for Yor to board
a luxury cruise. Meanwhile...</i>

6
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,727
You won the grand prize!

7
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,730
<i>...Anya won the grand prize at a raffle,</i>

8
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:26,109
<i>so the entire Forger family
ended up on the same cruise ship.</i>

9
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,448
<i>There were many assassins
secretly on board the ship.</i>

10
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,618
<i>Sickle-and-Chain Barnaby!</i>

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,165
<i>What should I do?
We'll cause a commotion!</i>

12
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,293
Wow! You're so cool, Circus Lady!

13
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,253
<i>You're a lifesaver, Anya!</i>

14
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:49,340
<i>Anya works hard to keep
Yor's other identity a secret from Loid.</i>

15
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,842
<i>Heroic Anya!</i>

16
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,554
<i>I can barely calm my heart
from this exciting adventure!</i>

17
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,556
So damn uncool.

18
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,726
<i>Yor repeatedly dodges
the assassin's attacks.</i>

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,270
<i>For what am I...</i>

20
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,565
<i>I found you!</i>

21
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,400
<i>During the fireworks show,</i>

22
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,945
<i>the deadly battle
between Yor and the assassins ensues.</i>

23
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:15,325
<i>I just wanted
to protect his carefree life.</i>

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,746
<i>I'll continue doing that.
In fact, even more so now.</i>

25
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,750
<i>I'm sure Loid will give me his approval.
He will understand.</i>

26
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:29,798
<i>I will not stop fighting!</i>

{\an8}MISSION:34
THE HAND THAT CONNECTS TO THE FUTURE

29
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,662
The fireworks were beautiful!

30
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,457
I'm glad you liked it. But sorry,

31
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,709
I couldn't find Yor.

32
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,502
This ship is too big.

33
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,712
<i>Oh no!</i>

34
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:36,216
<i>I had completely forgotten about Mother!</i>

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,343
<i>I have to find her right away!</i>

36
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,434
<i>The State Security Service seems to be
in a frenzy. What's happening?</i>

37
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:51,439
<i>Urgent... crew... Planted in a room...</i>

38
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,567
<i>Bom... A bomb at the bottom of the ship?</i>

39
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,402
<i>What did he just say?</i>

40
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,572
<i>Who planted it? And for what reason?</i>

41
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:03,159
<i>What should I do?
Should I gather some intel? No.</i>

42
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,620
<i>I'm sure
the State Security Service will handle it.</i>

43
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,914
<i>It'll be risky for me to meddle.</i>

44
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,084
<i>But I also have to
think of the worst-case scenario.</i>

45
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,420
<i>To prevent a greater risk,
I'll have to make some sacrifices.</i>

46
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,007
<i>But I can't leave Anya behind.
What should I do?</i>

47
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,925
Father.

48
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,886
Anya's not done having fun.

49
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,887
Hey...

50
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,514
<i>Darn, at a time like this...</i>

51
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,434
I'm going to play over there,
so you go back to your room.

52
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,355
<i>Oh, it's a childcare center.
This is convenient.</i>

53
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:36,776
Fine. I'll pick you up in a little while,
so stay here until then.

54
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,694
Okay.

55
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,446
Please take good care of my daughter.

56
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,532
Her name is Anya.

57
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,866
I'll take good care of her.

58
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,327
Yay! I can play with balls!

59
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,415
<i>All right. Let's get down to business.</i>

60
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,835
All right, Anya. What would you like
to play with?

61
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,587
I'm playing with a ball.

62
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,840
Yes, you are! You're so amazing!

63
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,675
I'm going to get tired of this soon.

64
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,677
I'm tired of it.

65
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,971
Yes, you sure are.

66
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:06,889
I want to draw.

67
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,600
Sure. Hold on.

68
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,854
All right, what should we draw?

69
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:17,233
Wait... Anya...

70
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,288
Well? Can you defuse it?

71
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,498
Shut up. I'm trying to concentrate.

72
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,418
We're counting on you.
There are tons of VIPs on this ship.

73
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,211
That's why you need to shut up.

74
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,756
I heard there was a bomb around here.

75
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,675
Yes, it's over here.

76
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,472
Excuse me. I used to work
in the bomb disposal unit

77
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,976
in the marines. Perhaps I can be of help.

78
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,436
Yes!

79
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,355
Is it possible to transport this bomb
somewhere else?

80
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,482
Impossible.

81
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,984
It's rigged with a trap.

82
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,446
It's a B-CP62 model time bomb.

83
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,157
<i>It's the model commonly used
by Western extremists.</i>

84
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,076
<i>Could the target be an Eastern VIP?</i>

85
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,495
<i>Or maybe this entire ship.</i>

86
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,289
<i>No, I haven't received any intel
about such activities.</i>

87
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:16,501
<i>It could also be a setup disguised
as a Western operation.</i>

88
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,504
Hey, how is it?
Do you think you can handle it?

89
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,008
No problem at all.

90
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:29,514
<i>I'll have Father take care of the bomb.
I have to go help Mother. Where is she?</i>

91
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:35,770
<i>She killed all the well-known assassins.
What a scary woman.</i>

92
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,564
<i>That's the voice of a bad guy!</i>

93
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,650
<i>It's time to make an exit.</i>

94
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,736
<i>I made enough money here.</i>

95
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,031
<i>I'll get out of here
before the hyenas come after me.</i>

96
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:51,536
<i>You guys can continue fighting there
until your time runs out.</i>

97
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,538
<i>It's coming from the front of the ship.</i>

98
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:57,125
<i>This ship will soon sink
to the bottom of the ocean.</i>

99
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,836
<i>No one will know what's happening
until they're dying.</i>

100
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,089
<i>I lost the bad guy!</i>

101
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,842
<i>Never mind that! I need to find
Mother right now!</i>

102
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,846
<i>She's at the roof
towards the front of the ship!</i>

103
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,355
<i>That's Mother's stabbing tool!</i>

104
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:28,656
<i>Not close enough!</i>

105
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,792
<i>I can't get close enough
to finish him off!</i>

106
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:47,258
<i>Mother is right above me! She's struggling
because she has no weapon!</i>

107
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,051
<i>She's too far. I can't hear her.</i>

108
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,055
<i>How can I climb up?
Where are the stairs? There are none!</i>

109
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,812
<i>Anya will save Mother!</i>

110
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,483
<i>Let this reach her!</i>

111
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:08,946
<i>Rising hope!</i>

112
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,627
Hey, don't make any sound!

113
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,463
It's not me! What the hell
was that sound right now?

114
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,633
Once that monster of a woman finds us,
we'll be finished.

115
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:32,220
I know that. Now's our chance,
while she's fighting that sword guy.

116
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:36,224
We'll use this opportunity
to kill our target, Gretcher!

117
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,769
We won't be stuck here forever, right?

118
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,732
We'll kill them and get out of here
right away! Let's go!

119
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,999
<i>Just as planned.</i>

120
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,753
<i>Did I hear gunshots?</i>

121
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,674
<i>That's my...</i>

122
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,611
Hey, I'll end this with one last stroke.

123
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,999
<i>What a fool.
She's charging straight at me.</i>

124
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,090
That old man.

125
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,872
<i>What happened to Mother's battle?</i>

126
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,835
<i>It's finally over. I'm so tired.</i>

127
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,383
<i>Mother won! All thanks to Anya!</i>

128
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,761
<i>I have to let Olka and her family out.</i>

129
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:46,187
The bomb has been defused!

130
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,483
- Great work!
- It was nothing.

131
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,279
<i>Being surrounded by State Security
is more nerve-wracking than the bomb.</i>

132
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,034
What is it?

133
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,040
Goodbye, Princess Lorelei.

134
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:11,587
Let me hear the agony
as you sink to death.

135
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,105
I wonder how my weapon
ended up in a place like that.

136
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,274
<i>Was there someone else...?</i>

137
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,569
<i>Oh crap. I need to leave.</i>

138
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,701
I guess the wind carried it over here.

139
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,288
Director, are you all right?

140
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,211
There are still more bombs?

141
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:56,132
If the purpose of this bomb
was to sink the ship,

142
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,884
the amount of explosive powder here
isn't enough.

143
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,555
We should have the passengers evacuate.

144
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:06,267
Evacuate where? We don't know the location
or number of the possible bombs.

145
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,479
Plus, all the passengers are VIPs.
We can't cause a commotion.

146
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,606
<i>So the State Security Service
needs to save face.</i>

147
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,025
You better not make this public!

148
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:20,489
Order all available agents
to search the ship, and the crew.

149
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,909
Make sure the VIPs don't find out
what's happening.

150
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:34,462
<i>I have to hurry and return or the lady
at the Kid's Room will get mad at me.</i>

151
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:40,634
<i>Dammit... it hurts.
I need to remove the bullet.</i>

152
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,929
<i>Straightforward attack won't work.
I need to come up with a new plan.</i>

153
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,515
<i>I'll kill her for sure.</i>

154
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,936
<i>It's... it's the bad guy!</i>

155
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,522
What's with this kid?

156
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,571
<i>This smell... Is it explosives?</i>

157
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,365
<i>There's a bomb inside the clock?</i>

158
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,285
<i>There are lots more in addition
to the one Father is looking for.</i>

159
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,871
<i>Don't tell me... that bastard set this up...</i>

160
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,916
Dammit.

161
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,045
<i>This is an emergency!
I have to let Father know!</i>

162
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,589
<i>But I don't know where Father is!</i>

163
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,593
<i>And I can't tell him anyway,
because he'll find out about my secret.</i>

164
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,846
<i>Oh, this is not good.
There are bombs on board this ship!</i>

165
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,850
<i>They told me to search the lower deck
thoroughly, but where do I start?</i>

166
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,101
Excuse me.

167
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,605
How can I help you, young lady?

168
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,317
I just saw a strange man fooling around,

169
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,903
sticking boogers on that clock.

170
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,863
It's dirty, so please clean it up.

171
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,740
Boogers?

172
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,826
I'm sorry, young lady,
but I'm really busy right now.

173
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,123
<i>A report of a suspicious man
at a time like this...</i>

174
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,627
<i>It's probably nothing,
but it won't hurt to check.</i>

175
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,964
Okay, I'll go take a look.

176
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,758
<i>Like I said...</i>

177
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,302
<i>Those fireworks were amazing....</i>

178
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,596
<i>Please excuse me...</i>

179
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,265
<i>Tomorrow, on the island...</i>

180
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,893
I still have good reception.

181
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,896
<i>Please take it easy, Director!</i>

182
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,399
<i>It seems like all the assassins up there
got killed.</i>

183
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,491
Hey there, eavesdropper.

184
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:29,660
Where are you planning to go by yourself?

185
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,037
You were still alive?

186
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:34,832
You're the one who planted the bombs, huh?

187
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,668
You were planning to blow all of us up?

188
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,920
You were defeated. Stop making a fuss.

189
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,883
This is a chance to have the target and
Garden sink to the bottom of the ocean.

190
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,887
Did you forget that our client's friends
are also on this ship?

191
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,055
They're not worth worrying over.

192
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,393
Rest assured. The bombs were set,
disguised as a Western operation.

193
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,353
If all goes well,

194
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:59,648
this will start a war,
and weapons will sell like crazy.

195
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,817
It'll make our client very happy.

196
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,821
Whatever. Start up the boat.
We have a new plan.

197
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,324
Who said you could come on board?

198
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:12,328
There's only enough water and supplies
on this boat for one person.

199
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,665
Then I'll put those supplies to good use.

200
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,587
Bombs were found
in Cargo Compartment Three,

201
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,590
the upper part of the ballast tank,
and the boiler room.

202
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,468
Yes. Okay.

203
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,889
If it's that type of bomb,
it was most likely set by the same bomber.

204
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,352
Defuse it, whilst being careful
with the trap I mentioned.

205
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,354
All right, let's move on.

206
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:42,358
What? Another one on the upper floor,
at Deck Eight?

207
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,112
Here it is.

208
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:51,158
<i>It was placed in such a crowded area?
Sinking this ship isn't their goal?</i>

209
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,827
We're going to be repairing the clock.

210
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,412
We'll clear this area first.

211
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,876
<i>No, this bomb is about to explode.
What should I do?</i>

212
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,503
It's simple maintenance.

213
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,841
Hey!

214
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,552
- I'll go throw this into the sea!
- What?

215
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,520
I'll let you in on a secret
before you die.

216
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,524
The second fireworks show
will be starting soon.

217
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:27,027
You'll be able to hear the symphony
of screaming and crying

218
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,280
coming from the bugs
hidden all around the ship.

219
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:35,285
Wait! That clock is... an antique!

220
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,302
That was close.
Wait, did I see something there?

221
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,430
What was that sound just now?

222
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,098
Is it another firework?

223
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:59,768
Make some announcement
over the intercom to prevent panic.

224
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,312
Yes, sir.

225
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,567
<i>All right! He got rid of the bomb!
All thanks to Anya!</i>

226
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,068
I found you!

227
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,112
You're not supposed to leave on your own!

228
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:14,450
M... Miss... I'm sorry
but I really needed to poop...

229
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,494
Then you should've told me that!
Let's go back.

230
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,247
Wait! There might be another explosion!

231
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,208
What? You need to poop again?

232
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,085
Come on, let's go to the bathroom.

233
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,256
Do a thorough check of every section
of this ship including the upper deck.

234
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,302
There's a chance
terrorists are still on board.

235
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,848
Please ask the State Security Service
agents to be on guard round the clock.

236
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:39,850
Yes, sir!

237
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,109
I heard an explosion a while ago.

238
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:52,863
There may still be assassins on board.
Don't let your guard down.

239
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,618
The preparation is done. It's
a little early, but let's lower the boat.

240
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,456
Stay under this blanket until you're
far away from the cruise ship.

241
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:03,373
I understand.

242
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,375
I wish you well!

243
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,887
Thank you so much.

244
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,391
Oh... your clothes will get dirty
with blood...

245
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,646
He wants to give you a farewell hug.

246
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,651
No... my hands are dirty and sticky...

247
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,903
Those hands

248
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,156
have connected him with his future.

249
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,210
He's so warm.

250
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,674
<i>Maybe it's something impossible for you.</i>

251
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:57,886
<i>Maybe it's none of my business. But...</i>

252
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,056
<i>I pray that you and your family</i>

253
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,601
<i>can enjoy a peaceful life.</i>

254
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,438
There seems to be no problem.

255
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,151
We'll just wait for confirmation
that the other boat has picked them up.

256
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,154
Don't let your guard down until morning...

257
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:23,120
Don't become sentimental.

258
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:28,750
You mustn't forget that
we're just common soldiers.

259
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,836
I'm sorry!

260
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:35,591
By the way, I forgot to relay
the message that came in for you.

261
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:40,554
Forger is requesting to meet up with you
at tomorrow's port of call.

262
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,516
Loid and Anya made that request? But...

263
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,894
I'll keep watch
for any remaining assassins.

264
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,480
Go with your family. It's your reward
for completing your mission.

265
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,239
Ice your wound to prevent your face
from swelling.

266
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,409
Try to hide the wound on your chest too.

267
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:06,205
Yes, I will hide it!
I won't be wearing any swimsuits!

268
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,668
<i>I think we're safe for now.</i>

269
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:15,255
<i>I'm sure I can leave the rest
to the State Security Service.</i>

270
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,758
Sorry, I'm late.

271
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,348
She fell asleep
while she was waiting for you.

272
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,515
Sorry.

273
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,602
<i>It was an emergency situation,</i>

274
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,563
<i>but I once again ended up
leaving my family behind.</i>

275
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,775
<i>What are you saying, Twilight?</i>

276
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,402
<i>This "family" is also part of my mission.</i>

277
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:43,033
<i>No, this time, the mission was to take
a vacation, which isn't really a mission...</i>

278
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,626
{\an8}MISSION:35
PART A: ENJOY THE RESORT TO THE FULLEST
