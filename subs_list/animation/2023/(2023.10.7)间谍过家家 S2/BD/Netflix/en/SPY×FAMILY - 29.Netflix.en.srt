<i>The Pastry of Knowledge.</i>

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:08,091
<i>It's one of Eden Academy's seven wonders,
which is whispered among the students.</i>

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:11,928
<i>A mysterious pastry chef randomly
appears in the cafeteria out of nowhere</i>

4
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,597
<i>and serves exquisite desserts</i>

5
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,266
<i>on a whim.</i>

6
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,476
<i>Many of those who ate it,</i>

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,438
<i>later became Imperial Scholars.</i>

8
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,690
<i>Therefore a rumor spread</i>

9
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,735
<i>that eating his desserts will
make one smarter in an instant.</i>

10
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:30,321
<i>A group of students at Eden are still
vying for a chance to order his dessert.</i>

00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,790
MISSION:29
PART A: THE PASTRY OF KNOWLEDGE

13
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,752
Are you, by any chance,

14
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,295
the prince I met the other day?

15
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,799
No, I'm just your clone.

16
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,427
No, I know what I'm seeing.
Your eyes, and hair...

17
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,930
Yes, you're my prince! I love you!

18
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:22,976
No, I'm just another female sheep
just like you.

19
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,021
Oh come on! This story is going nowhere!

20
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,817
- The story's a mess!
- But they look identical.

21
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,069
Just ignore that part
for the sake of the story.

22
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,904
It's my turn next.

23
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,740
It'll be a battle between
twins separated at birth.

24
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,244
No way! A battle will end up
damaging them!

25
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,913
By the way, have you heard?

26
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,417
At the end of the term, we'll be divided
into classes by academic ability.

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,334
What do you mean?

28
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:52,213
Basically, someone like me
who has decent grades

29
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,424
and someone like you
who's not doing so well,

30
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,302
will end up in separate classes
for certain subjects.

31
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,595
LABORIOUS CLASS - OTHER

32
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,014
I'll be all alone!

33
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:04,893
That's right. So you have to
make sure you study harder.

34
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,353
In addition to the midterms and finals,

35
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,648
I hear that tomorrow's quiz
will also be taken into consideration.

36
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,942
The test on classical language
will be one of them!

37
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,444
This is not good!

38
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,446
It's all over for me now.

39
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,658
- Did you hear? It appeared!
- What?

40
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,037
That rumored dessert
is available at Dining Hall Two!

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,081
- What are you talking about?
- You idiot! You don't know?

42
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,293
It's the dessert made by
the legendary former royal pastry chef!

43
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,420
The Pastry of Knowledge!

44
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:37,050
It's the phantom dessert that makes
anyone who eats it an Imperial Scholar!

45
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,011
This year, it's macarons.

46
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:43,765
The supply is limited, so let's hurry
before they're all gone!

47
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,774
If I eat that, I can be a genius too!

48
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,901
{\an8}It sounds too good to be true,

49
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,946
{\an8}but it doesn't hurt to rely
a little on luck! Not only that...

50
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,490
macarons made by a former royal chef!

51
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,701
- I want a taste! They'll be delicious!
- What's a macaron?

52
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,455
There it is! We have to hurry,
or they'll run out!

53
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,961
- Second son!
- Shorty!

54
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,089
- Why are you so desperate?!
- Shut up! You're just as desperate!

55
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,676
There's only one left of
Pierre Pommier's newest dessert.

56
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,136
It's first come first serve.

57
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,138
<i>I won't let you guys have it!</i>

58
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,891
<i>This is a battle with a Stella Star
on the line!</i>

59
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,019
- I'll take one please.
- Sure thing.

60
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,023
{\an8}We're all sold out today.

61
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,733
Wow, I'm in luck!

62
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:39,070
I wonder if I can get a Stella Star now!
I'm so excited!

63
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,030
- George.
- What?

64
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,032
You little jerk, that's mine!

65
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,576
Give that to me!
I was planning to eat that!

66
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,829
This is robbery!

67
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:51,541
I bought this with what little money
I have! I'm not giving it away!

68
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,169
Hey! I never got my pencil case
back from you!

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,840
And I ended up having to sing for you!
It was embarrassing.

70
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,008
I gave you a leaf.

71
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:03,511
Fine then. There's five macarons

72
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:07,432
so you guys can take four of them,
and let's call it even, okay?

73
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,142
You're not so bad after all.

74
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,227
There are four left.

75
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,948
<i>And thus,</i>

76
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:28,786
<i>it was the beginning of a fierce battle
to become the next Imperial Scholar.</i>

77
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,124
One game of Old Maid.

78
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,418
The player in last-place
won't get the macaron.

79
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,420
Sure. Bring it on.

80
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,423
I've never played cards before.
I don't know the rules.

81
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,842
- Is she serious?
- It's simple.

82
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,429
Pair up the cards with the same number,
while avoiding the joker card.

83
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,472
Got it.

84
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,433
Let's begin.

85
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,435
<i>Pass the joker.</i>

86
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:55,563
<i>- Make her take it, so that she'll lose!
- Roger!</i>

87
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:59,442
<i>The Pastry of Knowledge would be wasted
on someone who can't play the Old Maid.</i>

88
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,450
Hey, it's your turn to draw a card.

89
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,370
Right now, I have a six, four, ten, and...

90
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,456
You don't have to reveal your cards, Anya.

91
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,834
<i>What an idiot.</i>

92
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,713
<i>I'll make the joker stand out,
and hide the six a little.</i>

93
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:22,965
Go on and pick a card.

94
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,137
Six!

95
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,101
Impressive, Anya!

96
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,019
That was a coincidence.

97
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:41,109
Four! Ten! A! Old man!

98
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,612
I did it!
I don't have any more cards left!

99
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,323
Hold on! Why are you so good at this?

100
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:51,619
That's right! You cheated!
You must have marked the cards!

101
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,871
Hey, stop accusing her like that.

102
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,043
<i>If she didn't cheat, the only explanation
left is that she can read minds!</i>

103
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,629
<i>Oh crap! I got a little carried away!</i>

104
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,842
If you're going to be so adamant,
let's do another round.

105
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,761
What? You're too soft.

106
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,932
Let's play with a brand-new deck!
We'll switch up the order too!

107
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:16,227
- Don't you dare cheat anymore!
- I wasn't.

108
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,188
<i>That was close.</i>

109
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,232
<i>I have to make mistakes on purpose</i>

110
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,277
<i>so that they don't find out
that I'm a telepath.</i>

111
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,162
<i>The joker came to me.</i>

112
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,079
Your turn.

113
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:41,085
<i>- The joker is in the middle. Pick that!
- I have to make a mistake on purpose.</i>

114
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:46,966
Oh no. I made a mistake
and picked the joker.

115
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,012
- You're so lame!
- How stupid! So dumb!

116
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,598
<i>This is time to use my...</i>

117
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,808
Anya, you can't punch them.

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,936
I wasn't lucky this time.

119
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,107
<i>That was close. If I get expelled
the mission will fail.</i>

120
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,235
<i>I need to be a cool liar, like Father.</i>

121
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,530
<i>It's no big deal. I'll be all right
as long as I make him pick</i>

122
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,781
<i>the joker.</i>

123
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:11,866
Pick a card.

124
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:32,011
<i>She's so easy to read.</i>

125
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,347
All right. I got a pair.

126
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,683
<i>Wait, don't tell me...
Can he read minds too?</i>

127
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,148
- I'm out!
- Me too!

128
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,485
<i>Oh crap! I still have the joker!</i>

129
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,153
I'm out too!

130
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,743
- Damian, you're not good at this, huh?
- Shut up!

131
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,662
You can do it, Anya!

132
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,705
I can do this!

133
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,667
<i>This will decide the game.</i>

134
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,169
<i>I can win as long as I look
at the expression on her face!</i>

135
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:09,257
<i>I have to deceive him
and make him pick the joker!</i>

136
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,261
<i>If I lose, I can't eat that dessert,
and I'll be as dumb as ever.</i>

137
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:17,265
<i>Then I'll fail the test, and I won't be
in the same class as Becky!</i>

138
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,434
<i>I'll be all alone!</i>

139
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,271
<i>All right! This one is not the joker!</i>

140
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,545
Here's four macarons.

141
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,339
Hooray! They look delicious!

142
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,591
How exciting!

143
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,052
Why in the world did you
pick the joker at the very end, Damian?

144
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,345
Shut up!

145
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,348
<i>That was a dirty move, dammit!</i>

146
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,352
Hey,

147
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,234
wanna split this?

148
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,823
I don't want it, you idiot!

149
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:19,243
I can become an Imperial Scholar
without eating something like that!

150
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,454
An idiot should eat that! idiot!

151
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:25,166
- Unbelievable.
- He's so rude!

152
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,959
Let's eat, Anya!

153
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,253
Let's enjoy it!

154
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,593
- It's delicious!
- Now I can get a Stella Star too!

155
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,742
Begin your quiz.

156
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,883
That's it. I'm going to be all alone.

157
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,511
My future here at school is looking bleak.

158
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,138
That's not true! Let's work hard
on the finals!

159
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,558
Yeah. You're better off than me
who's already all alone.

160
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,730
Wow, these school tests
are pretty hard, huh?

161
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,150
I'm going to sulk for a bit.

162
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,281
<i>Her academic skills
have improved a little,</i>

163
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,075
<i>but there's a long road ahead of us.</i>

164
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,495
<i>This classical language test...</i>

165
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,580
<i>Points were docked for misspellings,</i>

166
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,333
<i>but she would've scored high
if it wasn't for that.</i>

167
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,044
<i>She hasn't studied much
classical language yet.</i>

168
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,713
<i>Did she learn it in the environment
of her upbringing?</i>

169
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,842
<i>But there are no countries
that still use that language.</i>

170
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,847
<i>No, there's no point in
delving into her past.</i>

171
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,600
Hey Anya, I made Salisbury steak
for dinner.

172
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,394
Salisbury steak!

173
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,896
I tried my hand at making dessert!

174
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,239
This is the fake ID for
Department Two of Doust Industries.

175
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:23,325
And this is the engine test results
for a new fighter jet.

176
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,493
{\an8}MISSION:29 - PART B:
THE INFORMANT'S GREAT ROMANCE PLAN II

177
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,911
{\an8}Thanks for your help.

178
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,706
Well, it's not for free.

179
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,876
What about the pictures of the members
of the association I asked for?

180
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,503
Oh that. Give me some more time.

181
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,548
One informant who specialized in that
was recently eliminated.

182
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,050
- State Security Service?
- No.

183
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,305
I don't know for sure, but rumor says
that he was eliminated by The Garden.

184
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,935
<i>Garden? The group of assassins that's been
operating in this country since long ago?</i>

185
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,146
<i>They're an urban legend, aren't they?</i>

186
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,024
<i>No, they definitely exist.</i>

187
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,944
<i>They've been purging traitors
under the orders of the shadow government.</i>

188
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:03,199
Well, it's no surprise that there's
an unofficial paramilitary organization.

189
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,327
They're nothing that soft, you idiot!

190
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,080
They're so strong that one soldier
can wipe out an entire military troop!

191
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,333
Stop being ridiculous
and fulfill my request.

192
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,338
Wait. In exchange for all the extra work,
help me with my job.

193
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,547
A job?

194
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,840
LOST

195
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,384
- This cat.
- A lost cat?

196
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,971
This is Kopi who belongs to a server named
Kacey, who works at my favorite café.

197
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,390
He's been lost since last week,

198
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,268
and Kacey is devastated.

199
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,105
Twilight, in order to make
Kacey smile once again,

200
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,317
and to increase my chances with her,

201
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,402
help me find this cat!

202
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,863
Hey! Stop right there!

203
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,533
I won't give you intel,
if you won't help me!

204
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,825
Hey!

205
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:51,372
I'll even add in the newly invented
toothbrush-shaped pistol.

206
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:55,084
Dammit! He's so cold-hearted!

207
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,753
Fine then. I'll find that cat
all on my own!

208
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,881
Don't underestimate an informant!

209
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,925
Hey, Jeffrey.

210
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,887
That's right. It's a job.
I'm looking for a cat.

211
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,974
A male Nortblue with a bell
around his neck.

212
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,685
Let me know if you find him. Thanks.

213
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,646
It's been a while, Hound Joe!

214
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,648
I need to rely on your skills for a job.

215
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:19,441
Hello, Terrence!

216
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,527
Yes, it's an emergency.

217
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,862
Hey, Nancy!

218
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,572
You know a lot about cats, huh?

219
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,324
Connect me to Harrison
at Branch Office 22.

220
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,951
Hello, Mr. Jasper!

221
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:29,952
Hey, Pat!

222
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:37,167
<i>Spotted a cat matching that description
on Ritter Street near the city hall.</i>

223
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,919
Nice work, Joe!

224
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,927
It should be around here somewhere.

225
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,638
- Oh, Franky, is that you?
- Huh?

226
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,892
- Yor?
- Hello!

227
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,893
Hello.

228
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,271
Oh yeah, you work at the city hall, huh?

229
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,899
Yes. I'm about to take my lunch break.

230
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,526
Do you work around here too, Franky?

231
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,528
No, the thing is...

232
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,533
A lost cat? How sad!

233
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,577
I'll help you.

234
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,747
What? But you're about to go
on your lunch break.

235
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,957
No worries. After all, you're...

236
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,835
my husband's... friend who is in need
of help!

237
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,714
<i>She's still playing the role
of a wife pretty seriously, huh?</i>

238
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,676
Of course, I'll only do it
if you don't mind...

239
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,554
- Then, I appreciate your help.
- Of course!

240
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,974
Which way did Kopi go?

241
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,477
I just know that he's somewhere near here.

242
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,021
<i>I planted C-20,</i>

243
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,399
<i>the Feline-form Listening Device
in areas where cats gather together.</i>

244
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:47,196
<i>It's installed with sensors that'll react
to the sound of the bell on Kopi's collar.</i>

245
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,574
Franky, you're so amazing!

246
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,618
Leave it up to me!

247
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,666
<i>The C-20 at Point A is being attacked!</i>

248
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,583
<i>Oh no!</i>

249
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,671
No way! It was destroyed!

250
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,255
What about the other ones?

251
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,470
They were eliminated
because they were seen as intruders.

252
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,639
This strategy has failed.

253
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,642
It's tough out there
in the world of cats, huh?

254
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,603
Then I will maneuver things
to lure the cats to us!

255
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,023
CAT-NIP, the Cat Nearness
Inducement Prototype Decoy System!

256
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,072
This releases the scent of catnip
to lure the cats to us.

257
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,784
Wow, Franky, you're so talented!

258
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:35,244
Are you a craftsman?

259
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,539
I'm just a boy who always dreamed
of making the world a better place

260
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:42,626
with my inventions and perhaps
getting rich from patents.

261
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,253
How lovely!

262
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,339
<i>I can't tell her what I really do.</i>

263
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,850
Whoa!

264
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,021
Oh my.

265
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,234
Oh no! There's too many of them!

266
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,653
Which one of them is Kopi?

267
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,827
- There it is! The gray one!
- What? Which one?

268
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,249
I'll get him no matter what!

269
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,421
Hyper Long Hand! Catch him!

270
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,761
I can't do a pinpoint attack!
I need a broader approach!

271
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,473
Hey, don't get inside!
Camera-shaped Net Launcher!

272
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,642
I hear he's really cautious.

273
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,895
I'm going to pretend
I'm only taking a picture.

274
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,480
I have to be careful here.

275
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,651
<i>But since it's disguised as a camera,
this launcher doesn't have a good range.</i>

276
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,321
<i>I have to get within two meters
to catch him!</i>

277
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,465
- Stop right there!
- That must be Kopi!

278
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,851
Kopi, you made me mad!

279
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,229
There's nothing you can do
to fix that now!

280
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,698
This is the ultimate weapon
that took me ten years to develop!

281
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,451
It's my exoskeleton power suit that
will give me

282
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,454
{\an8}phenomenal physical abilities!
Or at least it should...

283
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,166
Just you wait! After I turn on the power,
it takes 15 minutes

284
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,419
for the battery to warm up the motor.
Sit tight!

285
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,843
What? You idiot! That's a big street
up ahead! It's dangerous!

286
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,346
Stop! Sorry, I promise
I won't chase you anymore!

287
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:03,016
Franky, I'm going to borrow
this for a little bit.

288
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,710
I caught him!

289
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,381
I caught him, Franky!

290
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,717
Oh, yeah. Th... thanks.

291
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,720
Ten years... ten years of my work.

292
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:43,265
You're in luck, Kopi.
You can finally go home!

293
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,354
<i>But,</i>

294
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,483
<i>this will be all worth it, if it will
get Kacey to pay attention to me!</i>

295
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,069
<i>I'm coming for you, honey!</i>

296
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,489
Thank you so much, Franky!

297
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,910
Kopi, you really had me worried!

298
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,747
I'm happy for you, Kacey.

299
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:12,586
It's all your fault, Mar,
for leaving the front door open!

300
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,046
I'm sorry.

301
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,049
To make amends, I'll buy you
the matching rings you've been wanting.

302
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,052
I'm happy for you... yeah...

303
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,930
Well... bye...

304
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,310
Thank you so much, Franky!

305
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:33,273
I wish you both happiness.

306
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:46,370
<i>The man decided to live only for his work.</i>

307
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,669
<i>It sure feels good to help someone out!</i>

308
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,631
It seems like you're in a good mood.

309
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,677
Ooh, what could it be?
Did your husband buy you something?

310
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,470
No, nothing like that.

311
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,348
Must be nice to have such a happy life.

312
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,975
Yeah, how annoying.

313
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,852
Basically, she just became
a normal person. That's all.

314
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,941
- Normal? Am I normal?
- Huh?

315
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:17,901
I'm so glad.

316
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,404
<i>I guess my cover is safe. What a relief.</i>

317
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,198
Hey Sharon, don't let her get
carried away.

318
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,993
I was trying to be sarcastic.

319
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,371
Hey, Briar.

320
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,831
Oh, you're not Briar anymore.

321
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:35,460
- Forger. You have a call.
- Yes! Forger. That's me!

322
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,801
It's from your special customer.

323
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,310
Hello. It's me.

324
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,937
<i>Hello.</i>

325
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,525
<i>You have a new client, Thorn Princess.</i>
