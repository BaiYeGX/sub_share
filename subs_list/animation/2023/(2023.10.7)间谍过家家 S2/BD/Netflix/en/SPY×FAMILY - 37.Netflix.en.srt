<i>Countries worldwide are battling
a discrete yet fierce information war.</i>

2
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,092
<i>Two countries are in a standoff.</i>

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:11,970
<i>Ostania in the east. Westalis in the west.</i>

4
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:17,017
<i>Westalis launched Operation Strix
to find out the movements</i>

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,312
<i>of key figures in the Ostanian government,
who are plotting a war.</i>

6
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,274
<i>Highly skilled Agent Twilight,
was put in charge of the operation.</i>

7
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:28,111
<i>The man with a hundred different faces,
was given a mission</i>

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,196
<i>to create a family.</i>

9
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,325
<i>Father, Loid Forger, a psychiatrist.</i>

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,954
<i>His true identity is a spy.
Codename is Twilight.</i>

11
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:41,583
<i>Mother, Yor Forger, a city hall employee.</i>

12
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:46,045
<i>Her true identity is an assassin.
Codename is Thorn Princess.</i>

13
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,090
<i>Daughter, Anya Forger.</i>

14
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,260
<i>Her true identity is a telepath
who can read minds.</i>

15
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,846
<i>Dog, Bond Forger.</i>

16
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:59,017
<i>A psychic canine that can glimpse
the future.</i>

17
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,729
<i>For their own personal interests,
they created a fake family.</i>

18
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:07,192
<i>The mission continues, as three of them
hide their identities from each other.</i>

{\an8}ORIGINAL WORK BY TATSUYA ENDO
SERIALIZED ON SHUEISHA'S SHONEN JUMP PLUS

20
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:45,165
{\an8}MISSION:37
PART OF THE FAMILY

21
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,049
Bond, let's go for a walk.

22
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,433
You wanna come along?

23
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,436
Anya's not going.

24
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,441
Anya's really busy right now.

25
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,944
- This is the highest level of difficulty.
- Origami?

26
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,072
She says it's popular at school right now.

27
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,453
<i>She's concentrating so hard.</i>

28
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:28,708
<i>Since Anya's not coming, maybe I'll train
Bond instead of taking him on a walk.</i>

29
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,047
We'll be off.

30
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,550
Bye, Loid. Bye, Bond.

31
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,109
Go!

32
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,536
Good boy.

33
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,997
Incapacitate the target by going
for the arms and legs.

34
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,334
Don't bite vitals areas that would
cause critical injuries.

35
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,503
They need to be alive to give us intel.

36
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:17,757
You jerk! Did you forget
that I took good care of you?

37
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,427
Bad boy! Once you grip them
with your teeth, don't let go!

38
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,555
Letting go will not only put you
in danger, but biting the suspect

39
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,016
multiple times can lead
to critical injuries.

40
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:32,397
You're too gentle. Barking and biting
might not be your forte.

41
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,398
By the way,

42
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,109
why am I playing the role of the suspect?

43
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:40,655
- Listen up. I'm an informant.
- It can't be helped. I'm training Bond.

44
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,448
"It can't be helped," my ass!

45
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,410
Explain yourself in 500 words!

46
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,371
The situation around us
is threatening and dangerous.

47
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,916
- So we must be prepared just in case.
- That explanation wasn't good enough.

48
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,586
All right. That's enough for
the suppression and securing training.

49
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,923
Let's move onto screening scents
and explosives detection.

50
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,467
This training will be tough.

51
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,469
I have to be part of that too?

52
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,430
I have to play the part of the bomber?

53
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,435
What's wrong? Are you having
a hard time concentrating?

54
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,478
Project Apple

55
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,648
was a study to create intelligent
military dogs, right?

56
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,943
He was forced to train back then,
so he must be sick and tired of it.

57
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,112
I see.

58
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,951
You can't even do something
this simple, you useless mongrel.

59
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,203
This project is a failure.

60
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,456
It's time to get rid of these dogs.

61
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,254
To dogs, both training and taking part
in real battles,

62
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,465
is not much different than playing.

63
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,800
Make the training more enjoyable for him.

64
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,470
That's something you really need
to work on.

65
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,264
Take him on a walk for a change of pace.

66
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,642
- Anyways, I'll be off.
- Wait!

67
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,233
Let's go for a walk.

68
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,158
Wow! You made so many of them.

69
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,993
Those stars are so cute.

70
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,998
These aren't just normal stars.

71
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,253
Anya Forger, you have been awarded with
a Stella Star!

72
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,396
Don't scavenge for food.

73
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,657
<i>My ice cream!</i>

74
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,369
<i>I only got to eat a little bit of it!</i>

75
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,579
<i>What a loser!</i>

76
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,208
<i>Starting today, your nickname
is Ice Cream Dropper.</i>

77
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,460
<i>No way!</i>

78
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,889
Two scoops!

79
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,434
It's so unfair that you get
so much allowance.

80
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,274
You protected that kid's food? Good boy.

81
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,901
Bringing you into the family was worth it.

82
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:25,903
Whoa!

83
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,075
What's up with this bear?

84
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,828
Is he after my ice cream?

85
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,163
Stop it, Bond! What's wrong?

86
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,879
My ice cream!

87
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:46,090
I only got to eat a little bit of it!

88
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,843
Sorry, little guy.
I'll get you another one!

89
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,600
Three scoops!

90
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,186
- Must be nice.
- I'm so jealous.

91
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:02,315
It's so unlike you to go after
someone else's food.

92
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,109
What got into you all of a sudden?
Are you hungry?

93
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,622
I'm so sorry! Are you all right?
Call the ambulance!

94
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,468
You're being weird today!

95
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,724
Whoa! What's up with this beast?

96
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,976
I'm so sorry!

97
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,646
I apologize on my dog's behalf!

98
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,731
That dog needs to be trained!

99
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:48,069
Biting an innocent stranger
is absolutely preposterous!

100
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,987
Seems like you need some training.

101
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,909
<i>Wow, Bond! You saved the future!</i>

102
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,835
<i>How strange.</i>

103
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,381
<i>He completed both the socialization
and obedience training.</i>

104
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:11,759
<i>And he's not an irrational dog
to begin with, either.</i>

105
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,763
<i>Just as it is with Anya,
I still have a lot to learn about Bond.</i>

106
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,561
{\an8}<i>Oh no! A bird pooped on me!</i>

107
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,520
{\an8}FORESEEING

108
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:25,773
{\an8}<i>That's enough! We're getting rid
of a dog like you!</i>

109
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,233
{\an8}IMAGINATION

110
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,280
<i>Is he sick or something?</i>

111
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,074
<i>Should I take him to the vet?</i>

112
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,165
- Daisy!
- Ma'am, it's dangerous! Stand back!

113
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,834
Daisy is still inside!

114
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,211
No! My Daisy!

115
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,843
What's the matter?

116
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,351
<i>He's so restless today.</i>

117
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,148
No! Stop!

118
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,535
That's...

119
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,374
Someone call the fire department!

120
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,418
The fire is spreading faster
than expected!

121
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,924
<i>A fire? Did he react to this smell?</i>

122
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:40,473
- Is there anyone inside?
- No worries. Everyone evacuated.

123
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,477
There's been lots of fire these days.

124
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,021
There's rumor that it's arson.

125
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,023
Where are the fire fighters?

126
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,942
Daisy! My Daisy!

127
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,197
Idiot! Stay away! No one's inside!

128
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,449
You should stay away too!

129
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,202
<i>Wait, he might have caught
someone's scent inside.</i>

130
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,710
Bond!

131
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,713
Bond!

132
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,719
It's hot! What are you doing?

133
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,517
A puppy? It's one of the resident's pet?

134
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,229
You're quite impressive.

135
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,982
Let's get out of here for now.
Can you run?

136
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,360
Stay low.

137
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:37,863
We can't go back...

138
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,493
<i>He's scared of the fire.
I can't force him to go through.</i>

139
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,246
<i>This is not good. What should I do?</i>

140
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,040
<i>The lower level is engulfed in flames.</i>

141
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,252
<i>Then that would leave us
with the outside stairs on the north side.</i>

142
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,712
<i>It'll be dangerous,
but that'll be our only choice.</i>

143
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,755
Come, Bond!

144
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,009
What is it? This is no time for playing.

145
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,141
Y... you saved us.

146
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,103
You can sniff out danger
at times like this too?

147
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,479
You're amazing.

148
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,525
<i>We can't use the outside stairs.</i>

149
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:19,405
<i>That means we'll have to
force our way through the smoke.</i>

150
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,907
<i>I can manage, but Bond won't
be able to breathe.</i>

151
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:25,536
A plastic bag?

152
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,247
All right, let's use this

153
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,542
to trap in clean air from
the bottom like so.

154
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,587
It's a simple substitute
for an oxygen tank.

155
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,425
We'll use this in areas
where we can't breathe.

156
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,808
Let's carry the puppy in here.

157
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,813
Don't go astray! Follow me closely!

158
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,859
Let's go.

159
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,914
You made it out safely?

160
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,416
This little one

161
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,877
was left behind in room 407.

162
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,592
Oh! This is Ms. Bennett's puppy!

163
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,761
She was still inside?

164
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,138
You guys ran in there to save her?

165
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,599
Your dog is very impressive.

166
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,854
Bond! You're on fire!

167
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,858
Hold on! I'll bring a bucket of water!

168
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,036
He's so thin!

169
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,373
This is what you look like
when you're wet?

170
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,584
<i>I've never seen him like this before,</i>

171
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,670
<i>since Yor always gives him a bath.
But this is...</i>

172
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,257
<i>No, hold it in, Twilight.</i>

173
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,927
<i>I'm a cool-headed spy.
I must not let my emotions show.</i>

174
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,889
The fire is out now. Good for you.

175
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,810
What is it?

176
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,524
Hey! Sir.

177
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,193
- Please look after that puppy!
- S... sure.

178
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,403
Hold up, Bond!

179
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,453
Whoa. Look at those flames!

180
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,914
Daisy!

181
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,208
Ma'am, it's dangerous! Stand back!

182
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,918
Daisy is still inside!

183
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,006
This is so addictive!

184
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,679
What's that wet, skinny thing?

185
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:56,687
- Let go of me! Dammit!
<i>- Is he biting another stranger?!</i>

186
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,689
You little...

187
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,191
<i>Oil and lighters?</i>

188
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,570
Don't underestimate humans,
you little mutt!

189
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,327
You knew that this guy was the arsonist?

190
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,663
<i>This is the type of oil</i>

191
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,083
<i>used by the serial arsonist
that the authorities are after.</i>

192
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,338
Let's report him to the police
and leave the rest up to them.

193
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,590
Good work on catching him.

194
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:28,469
Did you pick up a scent at the scene?
Or did you sniff out his stress sweat?

195
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,307
Either way, you did a great job.

196
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,601
I'm so glad! Daisy!

197
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,020
I'm so glad you're safe!

198
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,105
What a relief!

199
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,900
I wouldn't have been able
to live without you...

200
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:46,612
My Daisy! I'm so sorry!

201
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,620
A serious looking guy,

202
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:58,082
and a huge, super thin dog
rescued your puppy.

203
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,875
They really deserve a medal.

204
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,878
Where did they go?
Let me go look for them.

205
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,463
Let's go.

206
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,884
It won't be good for either of us
to be in the newspaper.

207
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,430
<i>Let's reward this doggie for his work
with a year's worth of meat!</i>

208
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,148
You did well! You were amazing. But...

209
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,110
You're supposed to bite the arm,
not the leg!

210
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,156
Don't be reckless.

211
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,536
There's people at home who will be sad
if you die.

212
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,261
I'm sorry too.

213
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,597
Your role as a working dog
should only come second.

214
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,768
Understand that first and foremost,
you are a member of the Forger family.

215
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,603
Got it?

216
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,564
Are you not hurt?

217
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,359
You must have breathed in a lot of smoke.

218
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,862
Let's get you checked out at the vet
just in case.

219
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,867
Hey, what is it? Stop it!

220
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,203
Don't get carried away.
I just want the Forger family

221
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,956
to stay together for my best interests...

222
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,464
I don't have any extra missions tomorrow

223
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,175
so let's all go to the dog park together.

224
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,762
You've been all alone lately
staying home by yourself.

225
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,433
Why does your bark change
when you get wet?

226
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,364
I did it!

227
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,828
- Is that a knife?
- Oh?

228
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,913
It's a penguin.

229
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,915
Origami is pretty difficult, huh?

230
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,877
Oh yeah, how about something like this?

231
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,301
Ta-da!

232
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,518
Oh... I cut it a bit too much.

233
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,563
I'm back.

234
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,773
Welcome back.

235
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:58,071
Bond! You're all wilted and shriveled!

236
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,074
Oh my, what happened?

237
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,368
Oh, there was a bit of an accident.

238
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,205
We got splashed with water
on the way home.

239
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, I see.

240
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,086
His bark sounds different too!

241
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,881
Don't worry, Anya.

242
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,634
This is what happens to Bond
when he gets wet.

243
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,094
He'll be back to his fluffy self
once his fur dries.

244
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,014
<i>He rescued a puppy from a fire,</i>

245
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,933
<i>and caught an arsonist.</i>

246
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,852
<i>But I can't tell them
what really happened.</i>

247
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:33,106
<i>Father and Bond achieved
great things during their walk!</i>

248
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,568
Give me a second, Bond.

249
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,863
- I'll get you dried right away.
- Thanks, Yor.

250
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:41,865
Father.

251
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,879
Father, and Bond! I award you both
with a Stella Star!

252
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,384
You're playing pretend with Stella Stars?

253
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,888
It's the "You Worked Super Hard
While Taking A Walk" award.

254
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:12,896
Wow! Loid, and Bond, congratulations!

255
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,483
<i>This is all great, but please
earn yourself a real Stella Star.</i>

256
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,901
<i>Oh god...</i>

257
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,406
<i>All right, time to prepare dinner.</i>

258
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,824
<i>I'll help.</i>

259
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,451
<i>I want to eat Father's Hamburg steak!</i>

260
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:41,878
