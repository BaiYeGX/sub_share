1
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,758
<i>Yor is so lucky! This is so unfair!</i>

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,095
I wanted to take a vacation
on a luxury cruise too!

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,764
It's not a vacation.
She's entertaining guests for work.

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,851
If they needed female staff,
they could've chosen me!

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,729
Apparently, the guest has a baby,

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,731
so the staff member had to be a mother.

7
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:25,358
And I guess they're both
from the same hometown.

8
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:26,985
At least that's what I heard.

9
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,195
I'm so jealous!

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,865
<i>She's probably enjoying
an extravagant dinner,</i>

11
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,742
<i>eating delicious food!</i>

12
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:37,495
<i>Beer and sausages after work
isn't so bad either.</i>

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:38,788
<i>I agree!</i>

14
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,359
{\an8}ORIGINAL WORK BY TATSUYA ENDO
SERIALIZED ON SHUEISHA'S SHONEN JUMP PLUS

15
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,927
{\an8}MISSION:31
THE FEARSOME LUXURY CRUISE SHIP

16
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,346
{\an8}Everything is delicious, isn't it?

17
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,306
It's prepared by chefs

18
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,934
from a five-star hotel in Berlint.

19
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,187
Additionally, local companies
supported by the city were used

20
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:30,316
for manufacturing parts for the ship,
and handling the interior.

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,570
Now, now, let's end this boorish topic.

22
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,365
Well, I'd like to try dining
at that hotel.

23
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:38,992
It's delicious.

24
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,580
<i>I'm so nervous, I can't taste a thing!</i>

25
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,087
Calm down.

26
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:55,216
Enemies won't attack
in a public place like this.

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,596
Your family in the third-class cabin
can't enter here either.

28
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,849
- You're to entertain the guests for now.
- Yes sir.

29
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,228
Why don't we enjoy some drinks
at the bar downstairs, Mr. Grey?

30
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,900
- Sure.
- I'll head back to the room.

31
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,404
Make sure no one is tailing you
on your way back.

32
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,364
I understand.

33
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,829
No signs of anyone entering
while we were out.

34
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:29,125
- All right.
- In the end, nothing happened all day.

35
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:31,377
You must not let your guard down.

36
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,589
We don't have proof
that your enemies aren't on this ship.

37
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,551
<i>There's 30 more hours
until we rendezvous with the other ship.</i>

38
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,303
<i>If I was the enemy,</i>

39
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,680
<i>I would attack right before
you're set to leave.</i>

40
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,601
No point in causing a scene on a ship
when there's nowhere to escape.

41
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,394
Even if our plan hasn't leaked,

42
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,439
there are times when enemies
figure things out.

43
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,816
Tomorrow will be the crucial moment.

44
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,611
Or so the Director told me!

45
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,071
Let's keep our guard up!

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,823
You're right. I'm sorry.

47
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,662
Maybe I just want to believe
that there are no enemies on board.

48
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,957
This isn't just my problem anymore.

49
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,086
- I have to get my act together.
- Yes!

50
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,297
Once you reach your destination,
and your safety is guaranteed,

51
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,133
please let him play outside
to his heart's content.

52
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,433
You really don't seem like you work
in the shadows.

53
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,061
I'm sorry! I'll try harder!

54
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,232
If we're able to safely make our escape,

55
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,317
what will all of you do after that?

56
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,947
If we can't confirm any threats
from the enemies, we will stay put.

57
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,741
We told the other two city hall employees

58
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,413
that your family will be spending
the third day together in private.

59
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,455
So please don't worry.

60
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,792
The Director said he will have an excuse
for when we disembark.

61
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,753
What about you?
You won't meet up with your family?

62
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,465
Well... I'm here for work after all...

63
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,220
I told them that I'll contact them
once I have some time off.

64
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,890
It seems like this ship will stop
at a resort island on the third day.

65
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,894
I hope you can spend time there
with your family.

66
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,647
Well... I don't really...

67
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,820
Don't overeat just because it's a buffet.

68
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,281
I played a lot, so I'm hungry.

69
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,824
Remember your manners.

70
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:31,581
It's been a while
since we had a meal without Mother.

71
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,499
Yeah. It's lonely without her.

72
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,756
- Father, you're lonesome.
- No! I was just agreeing with you.

73
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:44,260
- Finish up, so that we can go back.
- These cashews are delicious.

74
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,221
Those were some great drinks,
huh, Mr. Grey?

75
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,807
<i>I didn't drink much.</i>

76
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,518
That was an exciting game of darts!

77
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,729
You were very skilled, Mr. Grey.

78
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,194
- Sorry, I forgot something back there.
- What?

79
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:04,489
Director, you're so clumsy.

80
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,240
We'll be going ahead.

81
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,918
There's more to do
aside from playing darts.

82
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:24,258
- How about another round of drinks?
- No, I've had enough.

83
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,688
Answer my question with a "yes" or a "no".

84
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,901
Are you an assassin hired
by Leonardo Hapoon?

85
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,868
You only have two seconds to answer.

86
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,161
I'll break your leg next.

87
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,413
Are you an assassin hired by Hapoon?

88
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,209
Are there other assassins besides you?

89
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,129
How many in total?

90
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,890
Sorry, that wasn't exactly a yes-or-no
question, huh?

91
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,728
How many are in your team
and where are they?

92
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,107
We're not a team.

93
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,109
I don't know how many are on board either.

94
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:28,030
Everyone is working independently.
Whoever kills first, gets the money.

95
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,825
There are some who are selling intel.

96
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,328
I was tailing you based on the intel
I received.

97
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:38,207
Shaty Grey in room 8053.

98
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,128
It seems like the intel I received
was correct.

99
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,273
Director, you're back already.

100
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,611
What? You're about to soil your pants,
Mr. Grey?

101
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,322
That's not good! Let's rush back
to your room.

102
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,283
Both of you should rest up
in preparation for tomorrow.

103
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,827
Director!

104
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,413
There are numerous assassins on board.

105
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,582
Her name and room number leaked.

106
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:24,128
The organization had planned this
in complete secrecy.

107
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,922
There's no way it could've leaked.

108
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,926
Do you have any idea how it happened?
Did you contact anyone?

109
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,885
No...

110
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,639
- Did you?
- No, the thing is...

111
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,767
Three days ago, I made one phone call

112
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,727
to my parents back home.

113
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,687
You idiot!

114
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:46,150
I didn't say anything that would
give away this plan. Believe me!

115
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,819
I wanted to say goodbye since
I'll never see them again.

116
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,697
That's all there was to it! I swear!

117
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,741
Enough.

118
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,619
<i>We don't have time to trace
our enemy's footsteps.</i>

119
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,205
<i>"Whoever kills first, gets the money"?</i>

120
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,915
<i>I had underestimated things.</i>

121
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,502
<i>They're not planning to wait
until tomorrow to attack!</i>

122
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,799
I don't think we'll go out anymore
tonight, so I think I'll get changed.

123
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,092
Good idea.

124
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,889
Director?

125
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,983
Director?

126
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,623
It's room service.

127
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,626
I didn't order anything.

128
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,027
You took those darts from the bar?

129
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,746
Stop shooting. There's a baby here!

130
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,374
Bring him in the room.

131
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,253
- Try not to leave any traces of blood.
- Yes sir.

132
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,924
There are numerous enemies on board?

133
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,926
Our intel has leaked.

134
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,387
We'll leave this room.

135
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,973
There are few rooms
in the second-class cabins.

136
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,018
Take the three of them
and go there right away.

137
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,521
What about you?

138
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,941
I'll take care of things here,
and meet up with you.

139
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,235
I understand.

140
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,447
If we cause a commotion,
the ship might turn back.

141
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,492
In situations where you can't
hide the body,

142
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,661
try to avoid fighting all together.

143
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,289
Hide your faces with these masks
just in case.

144
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,582
Hurry.

145
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,585
<i>Hello. Guest services.</i>

146
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,963
Hello. I'm calling from room 8053.

147
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,508
I'm terribly sorry but my wife and I
had a big fight,

148
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,094
and we damaged the door.

149
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,471
Can we ask for a new room?

150
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,811
I lost contact with Knockman.

151
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:29,605
Shaty in room 8053

152
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,524
is definitely our target.

153
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,443
<i>The husband's name is listed on
the passenger list.</i>

154
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,862
<i>Including the female voice I heard,</i>

155
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,740
<i>there's at least three of them,
not counting the baby.</i>

156
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,909
Is it her bodyguard?

157
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,621
<i>They seem to be changing rooms.
I'm sure their new room is just a decoy.</i>

158
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:50,751
Thanks to an impatient somebody,
their guard is up now.

159
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,841
If her guard is a member of Garden,

160
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,759
this won't be an easy task.

161
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,262
How about we all cooperate together?

162
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,140
Of course that means
we can't fight among ourselves.

163
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,724
We'll split the reward.

164
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,477
And we will share any information
we get our hands on.

165
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,230
What a hassle.

166
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:16,694
It'll be faster if we just kill
all the mothers on board with a baby.

167
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,325
We're assassins, not psychotic murderers.

168
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,996
Our business is built on trust.

169
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:36,755
There are few valued clients of
The Family on board this ship.

170
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,011
If we want to get paid,
we can't cause unnecessary commotion.

171
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,432
As for you, please keep us updated
on all that you find out.

172
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,185
We're paying you well.

173
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,188
I sell my information impartially.

174
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,525
Work hard so that you guys
don't get outdone by the others.

175
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:58,903
Hey...

176
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,989
Won't these masks make us
stand out even more?

177
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:06,785
No worries. There's a masquerade ball
being held at the Second Lounge.

178
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,412
So please don't remove it.

179
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:13,584
And please listen to what I'm about to say
without turning around.

180
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,087
I believe we're being followed.

181
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,216
Ever since we left the room.

182
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,926
No way. What are we going to do?

183
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,929
Let's lose him before
they find out our destination.

184
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,306
Will we be able to do that?

185
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,935
Heading towards the stern.
Probably going to the Second Lounge.

186
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,436
<i>Okay. We'll head there.</i>

187
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,106
We're here.

188
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,945
<i>Bloodthirst!</i>

189
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,406
<i>They're coming! While we're in this crowd!</i>

190
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,077
<i>If I intercept and kill them,
it'll cause a scene.</i>

191
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,121
<i>Then the rendezvous might get canceled.</i>

192
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:53,082
Hey.

193
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,084
Excuse me.

194
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,419
<i>I can't kill anyone.</i>

195
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,340
<i>They sensed our presence.</i>

196
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,676
<i>But they don't know where we're stationed.</i>

197
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,472
<i>I can kill her. I'll just pass by,
and prick her with this poison.</i>

198
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,934
<i>I'll end it in a flash...</i>

199
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,987
Sir, you've had one too many drinks.

200
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,198
That was close.

201
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,617
Huh? What was close? Give me my button.

202
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,871
<i>What? What just happened?</i>

203
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,539
Sir.

204
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,460
Hey Andre! They're entering the lounge!

205
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,630
<i>Don't lose them!
The black-haired woman is their guard!</i>

206
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,465
<i>Find a blind spot and aim for the blonde.</i>

207
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:44,967
Roger.

208
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,480
Oh... my...

209
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,482
Are you asking me to dance with you?

210
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:05,154
I'm sorry, but I'm not a very good dancer.

211
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,157
Plus...

212
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,911
Believe it or not, I'm a married woman.

213
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,663
So I can't accept your offer.

214
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,171
- Good day.
<i>- Andre! What happened?</i>

215
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,174
Please rest for a little while.

216
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,926
<i>Andre! Answer me!</i>

217
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,305
We were able to lose them.
Hurry, let's go downstairs.

218
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,099
Past the promenade
are the second-class cabins.

219
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,520
DECK 4
SHOPPING PROMENADE

220
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,691
Father! I want this skeleton keychain!

221
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:47,529
It's so unnecessary.
Why is that even sold on board?

222
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:52,284
- I want it, I want it!
- It's late. Let's return to our room.

223
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,287
I want it, I want it!

224
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,124
<i>There are bugs placed all over this ship.</i>

225
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,503
<i>There are many government elites
and celebrities here,</i>

226
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,091
<i>so I'm sure there are few from
the State Security Service on board too.</i>

227
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:11,220
<i>I spotted a few suspicious people
in addition to the State Security members.</i>

228
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,807
<i>I'll lay low,
and try to stay out of the way.</i>

229
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,770
- I want it, I want it!
<i>- So much for laying low...</i>

230
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:23,023
- He should just buy it for her.
- How cute.

231
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:27,027
<i>Oh crap! This conversation
is being heard too!</i>

232
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:31,448
A normal parent would just buy it
for their kid! You must be a spy!

233
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,367
You asshole! We're arresting you!

234
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:39,039
<i>Which is it? Would a parent normally
buy it or not?</i>

235
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,834
<i>This is obviously unnecessary!</i>

236
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,253
<i>It's not good for her education either!</i>

237
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,798
<i>But if I make one wrong choice,
it could mean my life!</i>

238
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,719
{\an8}I don't want it after all.

239
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,221
<i>I'll kill them.</i>

240
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,808
<i>Did he really tell us to not cause
a commotion? I don't care about that.</i>

241
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:01,186
<i>It's 400,000 dalc for that woman
and her damn child.</i>

242
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>I won't let those sissy assassins
take them from me!</i>

243
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,819
<i>I'm the Sickle-and-Chain Barnaby.</i>

244
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,989
<i>I never fail to kill my target.</i>

245
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:17,286
<i>Sickle-and-Chain Barnaby! Who is that?</i>

246
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,790
<i>There they are.</i>

247
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,169
<i>According to the intel I intercepted,</i>

248
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,713
<i>the black-haired woman
is the skilled guard.</i>

249
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,924
<i>I'll kill her first.</i>

250
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,259
<i>Mother!</i>

251
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,305
<i>That assassin is trying to battle
with Mother right here, right now!</i>

252
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,766
Should I buy it or not?

253
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,145
<i>Take this! Sickle-and chain frog!</i>

254
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:45,689
<i>I hate frogs!</i>

255
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,107
<i>What's happening?</i>

256
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,736
<i>Yor? You're an assassin that hates frogs?</i>

257
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,905
<i>Let's split. No more Forger family.</i>

258
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,573
<i>We'll dump Anya too!</i>

259
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,118
Oh no! What should I do?

260
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:00,871
I'm sorry, Anya.

261
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,874
Let's buy this skeleton.

262
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,960
It'll be a precious memento
of our cruise trip.

263
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,963
<i>A normal father. A good father.</i>

264
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:14,134
I don't care about that! Go away!

265
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,764
<i>At this rate, Mother's battle
will begin any time now!</i>

266
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,350
I'll buy it for you,
so please don't get mad. Okay?

267
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:24,269
<i>If I let Father walk out of this store,
he'll see Mother fighting!</i>

268
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,439
<i>Oh no! It's a battle!</i>

269
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:31,151
<i>What's happening? What?
Yor, you're part of this battle?</i>

270
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,737
<i>Once he hears any screaming,
it'll be the end!</i>

271
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:39,618
<i>I'm the one that wanted to take
this cruise, so I have to do something!</i>

272
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:44,039
<i>What's with that face? Is she sad? Mad?</i>

273
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,624
<i>What is she feeling right now?</i>

274
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,045
<i>Did I hurt her that much
by refusing to buy that skeleton?</i>

275
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,089
<i>Are kids this age emotionally unstable?</i>

276
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,801
<i>That's right. You learned this
a while back, Twilight.</i>

277
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,595
<i>She may be trying to conceal it,</i>

278
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,306
<i>but there's constant darkness
in her heart!</i>

279
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,601
<i>- Her wound never healed!</i>
- Um...

280
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,480
Caring for Anya's needs is a part of
Operation Strix.

281
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,525
<i>Handler was aware of this all along?</i>

282
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:16,029
<i>That's why she planned this mission in
the name of a family trip to create peace!</i>

283
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,282
<i>I will complete this mission!</i>

284
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,868
<i>Father is always off the mark.</i>

285
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,912
Excuse me, are you looking for
anything in particular?

286
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:28,667
Lately, these t-shirts and hoodies
with our logo are popular.

287
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,670
Neckties with a whale design
are popular with fathers.

288
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,256
How about matching baseball hats
for the two of you?

289
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,509
There is a fitting room over there.
Please try it out.

290
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,428
No, we're not looking for that...

291
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:43,557
<i>I've no time for this. I have to
look after Anya's mental state.</i>

292
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,102
- Father, you don't get it at all.
- Huh?

293
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,899
An adventure is about enjoying
a type of excitement out of the norm.

294
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,151
<i>Out of overwhelming excitement,</i>

295
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,987
<i>one starts to want skeletons
and wooden swords.</i>

296
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,491
Father, you're not excited at all!

297
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,412
If you're like that,
it makes me feel down too.

298
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:08,373
I think you should express your excitement

299
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,418
with your entire being,
in order to please Anya!

300
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,922
<i>She's right.</i>

301
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,717
<i>I'm Twilight, the man with 1,000 faces.
How could I have forgotten?</i>

302
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,345
<i>It's important to play the role!</i>

303
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,097
<i>I must be a fun, and cheerful father!</i>

304
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,477
Miss, I'd like to try on those clothes.

305
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,230
- In fact, I'll wear it back to my room.
- Okay!

306
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:36,276
Father, those pants over there
with the squid print look fun!

307
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,738
I will try on every single
article of clothing in this store.

308
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,741
I understand. This way.

309
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,328
I'll be expecting to see
a very fun outfit.

310
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,579
Leave it up to me.

311
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,166
Please let me know if you need
a different size.

312
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:56,171
All right! Let's keep Father in there
for a while and buy some time!

313
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,507
<i>In the meantime, I have to help Mother!</i>

314
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,511
<i>Oh crap!</i>

315
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,472
<i>I forgot that Father
is a master of disguise!</i>

316
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:08,350
<i>He can change clothes in seconds!</i>

317
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,520
<i>I don't understand!</i>

318
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:17,067
<i>These clothes don't go
well together at all!</i>

319
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,113
<i>Is this the way to go? How am I supposed
to express excitement with my outfit?</i>

320
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,447
<i>Is there an optimal solution?</i>

321
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:26,410
<i>Dammit! This is no good. I need to search
for an even more perfect outfit!</i>

322
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,547
<i>What? They're not going to start fighting?</i>

323
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,180
<i>She dodged that?</i>

324
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,684
<i>All the while protecting the other two...</i>

325
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,439
<i>I didn't sense his hostility
until the last second!</i>

326
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,441
<i>This man...</i>

327
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,568
<i>is strong!</i>
