1
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,520
Yes?

2
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,840
Guess who it is?

3
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,230
KYAH

4
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,140
Yeah, it's you, Eita.

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,250
Were you busy?

6
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,250
I made some adjustments for the sens.

7
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:44,690
SENS: MOUSE SENSITIVITY

8
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,690
SENS: MOUSE SENSITIVITY
Free much, are ya?

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,640
Oh, right. You're coming
to our place today, right?

10
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,840
For Runa's home tutor.

11
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,490
Oh, so the schedule is unchanged?

12
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,460
Hm? Is it?

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,320
Anyway, bring me the manga
I mentioned the other day, okay?

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,380
I wanna read it.

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,440
Sure.

16
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,000
Yay! You're the best, Yamada!

17
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,630
All right, see you.

18
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,300
Okay!

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,660
Sure. Saturday next week, right?

20
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,350
Sounds good!

21
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,910
I get to play with Runa!

22
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,150
I'm so happy!

23
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,480
OCTOBER 3, SAT

24
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,030
MY LOVE STORY WITH YAMADA AT LV 999

25
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,590
Well, well...

26
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,310
I never expected the person
behind Rurihime...

27
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:08,040
...to be an actual woman,
and a cute one.

28
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,170
Based on my past experiences,

29
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,800
I was 100% sure that you'd be a man,

30
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:18,180
and of course,
I was prepared to love him,

31
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,970
but your being a real woman
really took me aback.

32
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,460
Looks like I was still
shallow in my predictions.

33
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,050
Err... Like I already said so many times,

34
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,190
I'm not Rurihime...

35
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,790
Still, I never dreamed of meeting
Rurihime unmasked in person.

36
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,900
Since I heard that a player
named Rurihime was also in FOS,

37
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,050
I'd been pursuing them
from the previous game,

38
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,090
but I didn't think I'd be noticed...

39
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,350
Not only cute, but you're also touted
as a fast ranker in every game,

40
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,440
RUNA SASAKI: I STILL HAVE SOMETHING TO DO,
and with that reason,

41
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,450
SO I'LL BE A LITTLE LATE.
and with that reason,

42
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,390
I THINK MY MMO FRIEND WILL BE THERE TOO,
it makes me proud as a fan.

43
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,060
SO ENJOY A CUP TOGETHER FOR NOW.
it makes me proud as a fan.

44
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,590
SORRY -RUNA
it makes me proud as a fan.

45
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,950
And then, it got realised
in this way today...

46
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:05,850
If you'd like, I was wondering
if I could join your guild...

47
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,300
Sorry! Need to wash my hands!

48
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,560
Roger.

49
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,820
LV. 05 - MIND SHARING THE DETAILS?

50
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:23,880
What's happening here?

51
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,620
Runa's not coming...

52
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,730
And a stranger was in
the meeting place instead...

53
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,900
Lady Rurihime?
You're Lady Rurihime, right?

54
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,830
Lady Rurihime...

55
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,650
He thinks I'm Rurihime,

56
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,640
and he's not listening to me at all.

57
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,430
Coming!

58
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,870
Welcome, Yamada!

59
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,670
Hello.

60
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,850
As handsome as always, aren't you?

61
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,090
Runa's always cooped up in her room,
playing games all day.

62
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,250
Can she really enroll
at your school like this?

63
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,250
Runa! Mr. Yamada's here for you!

64
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,420
Yamada!

65
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,610
Hi.

66
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,050
I'll leave her in your care, then.

67
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,790
'Kay.

68
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,530
Be sure to study properly, okay?

69
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,110
I will!

70
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,890
I've already solved the question
in the textbook as you said!

71
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,270
Here!

72
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:32,900
PRAISE ME

73
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,400
PRAISE ME
Runa...

74
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,640
Don't you have an appointment today?

75
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,050
Wh-Why do you ask?

76
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,380
Nah, it's okay if you don't.

77
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,710
AKANE

78
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,460
AKANE

79
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,170
I don't have any appointments...

80
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,680
RUNA SASAKI

81
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,250
She's not picking up...

82
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,170
What do I do now...

83
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,890
I'm all alone with a stranger...

84
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,020
Um, Lady Rurihime?

85
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,600
Excuse me,

86
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,930
but are you Lady Rurihime?

87
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,720
This is the women's room...

88
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,840
Are you serious?

89
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,200
Lady Rurihime, are you okay?

90
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,970
My stomach kind of hurts...

91
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,220
Anyway, this is the women's room...

92
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,610
Oh, I thought so!

93
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:55,320
Umm...

94
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,670
You're taking too long,

95
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,920
- This is...
- so I thought you might've fainted...

96
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,200
Hey! This is the women's room, mind you!

97
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,650
Lady Rurihime...

98
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,620
Could you open the door for me?

99
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,360
Could you please?

100
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,110
Lady Rurihime...

101
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,900
It's not something important.

102
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,170
Besides, she's probably
on her way home now.

103
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,640
So you stood her up?

104
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,800
I didn't.

105
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,990
I had an MMO friend go there instead.

106
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,650
An MMO friend?

107
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,500
He seemed to be
a die-hard fan of Bro's avatar.

108
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,760
When I invited him using Bro's account,
he was super excited.

109
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,340
Where are you going, Yamada?

110
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,140
Where are you supposed to meet up?

111
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,150
Why?

112
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,430
Why, you ask?
It's too dangerous for her.

113
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,610
I'll go check on her.

114
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,140
What about my tutor?!

115
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,460
I'll be back soon.
Do the textbook questions for now.

116
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,170
Wait!

117
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,210
Wow, that was something.

118
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,850
I BROUGHT SOME SNACKS
I thought this was an automatic door.

119
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,550
Eita...

120
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,090
What's up?

121
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,020
MY LOVE STORY WITH YAMADA AT LV 999

122
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:28,650
Wow... She really sent a message
from my account.

123
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,720
Now that's evil...

124
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,270
Where's the meeting place?

125
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,010
Uhh...

126
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,130
Oh, it's pretty close.

127
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,418
I guess it's about
fifteen minutes by car from here.

128
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,630
Why...?

129
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,560
Runa.

130
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,790
Runa.

131
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,930
Runa! What are we playing today?

132
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,670
Why can't we stay like this?

133
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,610
Akane's been kidnapped
by a seriously antisocial person?!

134
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,930
Is that true?!

135
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,270
Aka-Aka-Aka-Aka...

136
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,770
Akaneeeee...

137
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,940
I think I might've exaggerated it.

138
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,420
Akane!

139
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,740
Thanks for the ride, Mr. Kamota!

140
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,200
Mr. Kamota, you shoud've taken
a right at that intersection.

141
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,910
ROAD SAFETY CHARM

142
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,470
Mr. Kamota, we're off-course.

143
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,010
When you see Akane,
you'd better apologise to her.

144
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,050
I won't!

145
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,400
Cut it out already.
That's why you're hated even at school.

146
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,170
I don't care.

147
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,430
I have 300 friends online.

148
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,020
Akane! What do we do, Yamada?!

149
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,930
Mr. Kamota, eyes on the road, please.

150
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,650
Everyone just keep shouting her name...

151
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,590
So stupid.

152
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,480
Besides, who said you could let her join
the guild without my permission?

153
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,810
Now...

154
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,830
IT'S MY GUILD...

155
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,160
If old-timers continue
to push out newcomers like that,

156
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,650
the game's content
will just become stale.

157
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,690
Have some tolerance, will you?

158
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,460
What the heck?

159
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,800
That girl...

160
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,230
She was trying to be nice to you, right?

161
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,150
Saturday next week, right?

162
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,760
Sounds good to me.

163
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,180
All right, let's spread out
and look for her!

164
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,860
Akane! Akane!

165
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,620
Mr. Kamota, you're heavy.

166
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,620
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where is she?!

167
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,250
There she is.

168
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,210
That was quick!
Pretty observant, eh!

169
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,930
But...

170
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,670
She's looking so strange...

171
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,790
Aka...

172
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,970
Akane!!

173
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,980
Aka-Aka-Aka-Aka...

174
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,290
Aka-Aka-Aka-Aka...!

175
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:48,730
Huh?

176
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,740
Akane! Thank goodness you're okay!

177
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,110
Mr. Kamota!

178
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:57,110
You'll be fine now!
Leave it to the adult from here!

179
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,940
Who are you?

180
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,370
My name is Takezo Kamota,

181
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,860
the representative
for Kamota Strawberry Farm!

182
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,370
I have a friend in the attorney business!

183
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
I won't yield to any violence or threats!

184
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,730
Let's settle this at the courtroom!

185
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,190
You okay, Akane?

186
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,720
Eita? Yamada, too?

187
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,810
Why are you here?

188
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,220
Runa said she invited a stranger here,

189
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,910
so we came here out of worries.

190
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,970
What's up with your legs?

191
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,040
This is...

192
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,860
Pardon me, it was on me.

193
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,490
I spooked her at the woman's room...

194
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,970
Mind sharing the details?

195
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,760
You're too close.

196
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,620
Out of fear that Lady Rurihime
might have fainted in the bathroom,

197
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,200
I meant to give her some medicine...

198
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,260
Lady Rurihime?
Can't you open the door?

199
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,310
Then...

200
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,810
Excuse me, here.

201
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,510
ANALGESIC

202
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,440
Ah...

203
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,000
Lady Rurihime?

204
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,690
Lady Rurihime?

205
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:15,690
INTENSE PAIN

206
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,190
ANALGESIC

207
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,070
That's what happened.

208
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,670
After she was excessively startled,
she hit the toilet bowl at her shin.

209
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,830
IT STILL FREAKIN' HURTS NOW
Anyone would've been startled after that!

210
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,690
That's strange...

211
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,260
When a woman coops up
in the toilet looking unwell,

212
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,770
my mother taught me to silently
give analgesic pills to her...

213
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,400
You shouldn't have acted
with that local knowledge.

214
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,470
For starters, don't enter the women's room!

215
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,110
You are extremely rude.

216
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,800
How are you related
to Lady Rurihime?

217
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,350
I don't want to tell you.

218
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,400
I don't care anymore...

219
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,110
Yo!

220
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,900
So you came here
because you're worried about me?

221
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,930
Thanks.

222
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,660
Well... I'm sorry.

223
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,240
Why are you apologising?

224
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,210
I mean... had I told you
that I'd be tutoring Runa...

225
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,530
So you're Runa's home tutor?

226
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,330
Yes.

227
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,340
Oh, I see!
That's why Runa couldn't make it!

228
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,080
That's...

229
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,520
So that's the reason, huh!

230
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,250
Runa?

231
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,840
Runa!

232
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,670
Oh...

233
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,340
Ouuchh!!

234
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,170
Are you hurt?!

235
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:29,780
Huh?

236
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:32,290
Sorry...

237
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,070
Runa.

238
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,490
Come.

239
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,420
I'm gonna scold you.

240
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,800
I won't help you.

241
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,810
That was something
really dangerous you've done.

242
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,220
Please reflect on this.

243
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,410
Come on.

244
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,780
O-Ow, ow, owww!

245
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,140
Akane?

246
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,340
My stomach suddenly hurts...

247
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,280
Huh? Not your leg?

248
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,640
Huh? Uh, well...

249
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,360
The pain went up to my stomach...

250
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,080
What?

251
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,140
Why don't you use
the analgesic I gave you?

252
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,120
You don't talk to Akane!

253
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,550
He's still here...

254
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,580
UGH...

255
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:29,180
UGH...
No way... That won't work...

256
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,680
It has to be a first-class analgesic,

257
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,060
prescribed by a pharmacist,
or else it won't work...

258
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,510
First-class what?

259
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,590
About 500 metres from the station,

260
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,250
you'll find a drug store on the right.

261
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,410
Ah, okay. I'll go there now.

262
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,570
I'll go!

263
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,540
Please rub my stomach...

264
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,680
Oh, it'd be worrying
if only you go there,

265
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,060
so have Yamada
and Mr. Kamota go with you.

266
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,130
Also, you go home now.

267
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,160
Runa, what's your level?

268
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,390
Huh?

269
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,910
Oh, sorry. I mean in-game.

270
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,260
Uh, I maxed-out two already,
and now I'm just casually grinding...

271
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,310
Huh?! So we can't do hunting together...

272
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,330
My level is still low...

273
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,590
We can't go together
with that much level gap, right?

274
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:02,180
I was once rejected by Yamada, too.

275
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,100
Hunting together?

276
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,490
Your level is way below me, so I can't.

277
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,780
I don't wanna deal
with the EXP penalty.

278
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,680
I don't really mind.

279
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,440
I have a low-level avatar too.

280
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,790
Let's go hunting together next time, then!

281
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,070
My job is a Paladin,

282
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,960
and you...

283
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,790
Why are you talking to me so normally?!

284
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,840
Don't you find it strange
for me to stand you up?!

285
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,220
Huh? Err...

286
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,690
I stood you up on purpose!
I thought it'd be better this way!

287
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,430
I hate you, after all!

288
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,480
I wanted you to leave the guild!

289
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,570
I thought you'd start hating MMO
if I sent a weirdo to you...

290
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,340
I thought it was strange, but then...

291
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,110
I SEE...

292
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,350
Are you hurt?!

293
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,310
I guess I'll leave
the scolding to your brother.

294
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,390
I'm here to get along with you.

295
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,140
Everyone is just so nice to me,

296
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,070
and I've been thinking
that I'm glad I joined this guild.

297
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:31,680
But, they're your precious friends, right?

298
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,280
So that's why I want to ask you
to let me in the circle too!

299
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,610
As your friend!

300
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,150
I'm sorry...

301
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,880
I'm sorry for pranking you!

302
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,790
Girls in their teens
are so complicated...

303
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,740
MEDICINE

304
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,790
MEDICINE
To think she'd hate Akane this much...

305
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,730
I already give up...

306
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,200
She was so cute and honest
when she was little...

307
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,440
What do I do now...

308
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,630
Welcome back!

309
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,950
MEDICINE

310
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,070
Akane! Is your stomach feeling better now?

311
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:10,580
Huh? Oh, yes, I'm feeling better now!

312
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,680
Maybe it's because
Runa rubbed it for me?

313
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,630
That was rough.

314
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,310
Huh?

315
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:00,090
You'd been looking forward to this,
but then she set you up.

316
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,650
Ah...

317
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,110
Well, I guess I should've left...

318
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,600
...when I met that stranger.

319
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,930
While it pissed me off a bit,

320
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:13,260
too bad I couldn't play
with her normally.

321
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,030
But, yeah, just you see.

322
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,600
While I suck at romance,

323
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,840
I'm pretty good
at getting along with girls.

324
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,700
So, I'm sure I'll get along better with her,
eventually.

325
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,490
As one would expect
from Lady Rurihime.

326
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:32,470
You are indeed

327
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,890
HE'S STILL HERE?
the kind muse as rumoured.

328
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,480
Please date me on the assumption
that we'll get married!

329
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,890
Please go home!
