1
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,630
The clock says 2 in the morning.

2
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,620
I'm in my single apartment.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,210
Alone with a high school boy
who is a friend in a game.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,070
And my temperature is 37.8 degrees.

5
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,120
LV. 11 - There's Something I Want to Talk  About

6
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,030
LV. 11 - There's Something I Want to Talk  About
I slept like a log last night.

7
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,170
I slept like a log last night.

8
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,280
Sorry for not noticing at all.

9
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,440
Can you last with all these for a week?

10
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,540
Uwooogh
You're a goddess, Momo!

11
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:27,330
I mean, your fever always tends
to get so heavy every time.

12
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:27,340
You lack fundamental stamina too much.

13
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,050
You lack fundamental stamina too much.
You should do some training

14
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:29,420
You lack fundamental stamina too much.
Give me the stuff
that needs chilling

15
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,200
You lack fundamental stamina too much.
Give me the stuff
that needs chilling
Yes

16
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,550
Give me the stuff
that needs chilling
Yes
Have you visited a doctor?

17
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:31,770
Have you visited a doctor?

18
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,180
Yeah. Yamada brought me to a clinic
that was still open at night.

19
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,050
I'll be going there again tomorrow.

20
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,430
Wow... You even
 brought meat!

21
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,490
Huh?

22
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,430
Well... Yamada came
to check up on me yesterday.

23
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,020
Say what?

24
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,630
Have you two started going out
while I wasn't looking?

25
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,960
No way, we're still friends.

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,650
He really is a nice guy.

27
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,510
Wh-What? So...

28
00:02:59,360 --> 00:02:59,490
I can just tell her after she recovers.

29
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,410
I can just tell her after she recovers.
Mercy

30
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,690
I can just tell her after she recovers.
Mercy

31
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,410
Mercy

32
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,630
Anyway, that should do for now.

33
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,930
I'll be on my way now.

34
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,930
Thanks. I'll get your money,
so wait here.

35
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,340
"Is there a guy who'd go that far
for a girl he doesn't even love?"

36
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,950
That's what I think,

37
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,090
but I don't know bits
about Yamada's personality.

38
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,390
Akane's hurdles in romance
seems to get higher too

39
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,140
thanks to her heartbreak.

40
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,190
thanks to her heartbreak.
Stare

41
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,690
Well, not that I don't
understand, but...

42
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,070
I've put
 a lot inside!

43
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,070
I've put
 a lot inside!
Yep

44
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,330
I'll be going now.
Let me know ASAP if you need anything.

45
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,110
Yeah.

46
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,710
Also, timing is important in romance.

47
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,960
Oh, yeah... Right.

48
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,090
Glad you understand.
See ya.

49
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,860
You Have a Message from Akito Yamada

50
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,110
Thank you so much for today, how are you holding up?
Sorry i just saw your message, I'm fine

51
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,490
All green
for now...

52
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,750
I should thank him properly
after I get better.

53
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,740
What would work for him?

54
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,250
Akito Yamada

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,990
Are you okay?!
I can log in this weekend!

56
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,340
Let's play together
once you get better!

57
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:41,730
Let's play together
once you get better!
I'm so lonely!
Blush

58
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,190
I'm so lonely!
Blush

59
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,010
I'm so lonely!
Blush
Runa...

60
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,180
By the way,
did Runa log in yesterday in the end?

61
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,690
I told her we'd be greeting the new girl,

62
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,510
but I've never even met with her.

63
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,650
I'm sick of studying too,
so let's log in for a bit.

64
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:03,460
While Runa and Yamada aren't around,

65
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,050
maybe Rurihime
and Mister Kamota will be?

66
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,990
I want to grind together with them.

67
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,790
Akane Has Logged In

68
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,520
Akane Has Logged In
I haven't ground so much these days,

69
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,210
Akane Has Logged In
so let's do that all day long!

70
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,880
Akane Has Logged In
Oh, it's Akane!

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,430
Oh, it's Akane!

72
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:24,560
It's the new girl I heard about!

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,520
This is our new member, Tsubaki!

74
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,310
Nice to meet you! I'm Akane!
I'm a Lv. 55 Paladin!

75
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,350
I'm Tsubaki.
Nice to meet you.

76
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,530
I'm a beginner who just started playing.

77
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,960
We were just about to do
some map scouting with Tsubaki now.

78
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,050
Since you're here,
want to farm together?

79
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,010
I'm in!

80
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,700
Huh? But...

81
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,160
I still don't know how to get around
in this game, so I'll just be dead weight...

82
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,920
You can learn from Akane
how to play as a paladin.

83
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,410
So you're a paladin too, Tsubaki?

84
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:58,460
Is there really a lot of sorcerers here, after all?

85
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,920
Is there really a lot of sorcerers here, after all?
That's
 right

86
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,600
This guild's full of
magic users with high FP...

87
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,820
This guild's full of
magic users with high FP...
Huh...

88
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,900
Huh...
Also, everyone has higher DEF stats than me...

89
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,920
Huh...
I sometimes wonder
why I picked this class.

90
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,690
Huh...
I mean, it's written that it's
the recommended class for beginners.

91
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,610
But I think paladins can
be strong at higher levels.

92
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,010
But I think paladins can
be strong at higher levels.
Did the
Homework

93
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,940
Did the
Homework
It's said that one of the strongest classes

94
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,180
Did the
Homework
to solo endgame bosses is paladin.

95
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,960
Did the
Homework
It's worth grinding, so I like it.

96
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,950
Did the
Homework

97
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,350
Well, to each
their own way

98
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,330
Well, to each
their own way
She's really a nice girl!

99
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:32,580
She's really a nice girl!

100
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,250
But I heard the movement's so hard...

101
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,730
Don't worry! Leave it to me!

102
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,660
I need to show her my good sides!

103
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,500
I need to make sure
not to hinder everyone.

104
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,720
Mom! I can't find my donuts!

105
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,540
Let's go, then.
Have you checked your gear?

106
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,480
Yes.

107
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,380
Yes, I have.

108
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,950
The sky's so beautiful!

109
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:09,370
I love the game's sky graphics so much!

110
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,000
It might be my favourite thing in FOS!

111
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,250
What do you think, guys?

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,500
I'm kind of busy now!

113
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,630
They Don't Have Time to Enjoy the Sky
Strike!

114
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,510
They Don't Have Time to Enjoy the Sky
Shield! Shield!

115
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,370
Hey, stop having a peaceful time
and help us out, will you!

116
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:33,020
This is one tough enemy!

117
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,270
It'll be over in a microsecond if I join in.

118
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,560
It's not that strong a boss,
so break a leg!

119
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,280
You're kidding me!
Thing's got too much HP, it's literally four bars!

120
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,320
Normal Enemy

121
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,040
It's so interesting seeing your damage
counts lose to the boss' Natural Healing!

122
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Rurihime Has Gathered 2x Paladin's Hates!

123
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:59,170
Here it comes.

124
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,610
Dang it!

125
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,610
Strike! Strike!

126
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,420
But...

127
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,920
Strike! Strike!

128
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,590
Natural Healing

129
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,050
Natural Healing
For real...

130
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,550
This is unproductive as it is!

131
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,310
Thanks to the GM's Healing Magic,
we're not out of the loop, but...

132
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:22,690
My willpower's starting to get close to zero!

133
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,400
If you play it a bit smart,

134
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,450
the current you can beat the boss easy.

135
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,610
Huh?

136
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,450
Oh, right! I got it!

137
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,830
Maybe we need to spam the skill buttons?

138
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:33,990
Maybe we need to spam the skill buttons?
Is that what it means
 by playing it smart?!

139
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,580
Is that what it means
 by playing it smart?!
What... But I've been spamming a lot of buttons...

140
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,460
Let's do the button spam strat till drop!

141
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,080
One, two!

142
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,090
Ratatatatatatatatatatata

143
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:52,340
The Guild Master,
Aware of Why the Chat Went Silent

144
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,600
Annoyed

145
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,480
They must be spamming
them keys like crazy.

146
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,060
Need a hint?

147
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,980
Wait.

148
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,230
I think I got it now.

149
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,860
I couldn't
get it!
For real?

150
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,430
Maybe...
Don't say it just yet.

151
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:11,130
Okay!

152
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,990
Give me the hint

153
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:36,390
Feels Like 500 Million Years Have Passed

154
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,510
RIP my fingers.

155
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,130
RIP my fingers.
The Boss Went Back Home Due to Time Limit

156
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,640
The Boss Went Back Home Due to Time Limit
Same...

157
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:43,470
But we could drain the HP
in the second half, right?

158
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,490
It's like there was a timing
that made it easier to attack.

159
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,030
Yeah! When it spread its wings!

160
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,700
Maybe we should attack efficiently
when that happens?

161
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,660
Let's spam some skills
when that happens!

162
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:00,020
Why don't we check our skills' effects?

163
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,290
Right, let's recheck our gear too!

164
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,290
They're already getting along.

165
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,590
My armour got so tattered, so I'll take a rest

166
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:10,840
My armour got so tattered, so I'll take a rest
I'll log out, then! See you two again!

167
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,590
My armour got so tattered, so I'll take a rest
I'll log out, then! See you two again!
Okay! Thanks for today!

168
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,340
My armour got so tattered, so I'll take a rest
I'll log out, then! See you two again!
Okay! Thanks for today!
I'll fix your armour, so lend it to me, Tsubaki

169
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,850
My armour got so tattered, so I'll take a rest
I'll log out, then! See you two again!
Okay! Thanks for today!
I'll fix your armour, so lend it to me, Tsubaki
Thank you for today, Akane

170
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,560
I'll take it off now

171
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,370
Akane from the same guild...

172
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,770
That must mean that girl.

174
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,620
She was easy to talk with...

175
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,660
You still up?

176
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,700
You still up?
Yes

177
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,210
Akane

178
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,580
Akane

179
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,190
Hello?

180
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,200
Yes.

181
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,340
Huh?

182
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,470
Super Evil Demetal?
What's that?

183
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,820
The monster that spawns
at the first fields of the first city.

184
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,140
The one with long, four HP bars.

185
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,870
Oh, you mean the random spawn boss?

186
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:09,440
Yeah! Rurihime also said that!

187
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,970
Yeah! Rurihime also said that!
The first city...

188
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:11,860
The first city...
Have you ever beaten it, Yamada?

189
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:17,410
I've never faced such a boss in that rank.

190
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,730
I see. I thought there
might be a walkthrough.

191
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,750
Well... Maybe you'd be able to move
if there's a gimmick or something.

192
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,550
Super Evil Demetal

193
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,490
Super Evil Demetal
Gimmick...

194
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,330
Super Evil Demetal
Maybe there's a period
when it's invincible,

195
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,010
Super Evil Demetal
a pattern or something.

196
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:34,390
a pattern or something.

197
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,380
Yep! There was that!

198
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,050
What do I do in that situation?

199
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,140
Oh, buff? I see!

200
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,390
Oh, buff? I see!
Buff=Status Up

201
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,890
Oh, buff? I see!
Buff=Status Up
Might be better than
 random button spam

202
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,390
Do you think you'll like our guild?

203
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,640
Currently Fixing The Armour
 with Sewing Skill
Yes?

204
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,110
Currently Fixing The Armour
 with Sewing Skill
Akane was pretty easy to talk with, right?

205
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,900
Currently Fixing The Armour
 with Sewing Skill
Uh, yes...

206
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,690
Everyone is so kind,
I'm so relieved.

207
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,160
So much that I actually feel sorry.

208
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,660
Why?

209
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,090
I was never interested
in this game in the first place.

210
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,030
I joined this guild out of a selfish reason...

211
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,900
And yet, now...

212
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,870
I'm starting to lose sight
of what I wanted to do.

213
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:20,930
Y-You okay?!

214
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,350
Y-You okay?!
So dark

215
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,680
So dark
I'll lend you my ears if you want!

216
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,440
I don't have anything

217
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,190
I don't have anything
to talk about

218
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,430
I just kept on looking.

219
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,490
Just like that,
I kept being covered in fear.

220
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,580
It's nothing.

221
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,290
I just didn't have the courage,
and couldn't move...

222
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,960
You don't have
anything to talk about?

223
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,710
You don't have
anything to talk about?
Didn't have
the courage?

224
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,460
You don't have
anything to talk about?
Didn't have
the courage?
Couldn't move?

225
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:00,100
Err, I don't really get it, but...

226
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Why don't you try making a move, then?

227
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:03,510
It's done

228
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,430
It's done
If you have something you want to do,
then why not try doing it?

229
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,890
It's done

230
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,650
Courage and motivation won't
come to you if you just sit around.

231
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,330
You gotta move yourself!

232
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,150
If you want to change something, that is!

233
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,820
So...

234
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,660
Oh, shoot. It's already this late.

235
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,580
Sorry, I kept blabbering all the time.
You must be tired, right?

236
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,920
Yes. My hand got too tired,
I switched to Bluetooth.

237
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,680
Brutally honest, aren't you?

238
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,860
So what was your business, again?

239
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,920
Oh...

240
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,290
Well, rather than business...

241
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
I just wanted to hear your voice.

242
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,470
That's all. See you!

243
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,060
Akane

244
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,830
M-My hands...

245
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,220
Phone

246
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,540
Phone
...are trembling.

247
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,490
Phone

248
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,070
Oh, Momo? Thanks for earlier.

249
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,690
You okay?

250
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,500
Well...

251
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,510
There's something I want to talk about.

252
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,100
I'll holler at you again
Got it, I'll be waiting
About tomorrow's meeting,
There's a cafe I want to go to, so let's meet up there, okay?
 See You at 11!
Momo

253
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,340
This is the place?

254
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,940
So Cute

255
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,780
So Cute
So there's a cafe this cute, huh?

256
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:54,670
So, about the thing I wanted to
ask you over the phone...

257
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:58,000
I, uh...

258
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,420
Why do you think I got dumped?

259
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,470
I'll take your orders.

260
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,680
I'll have chunky soufflé
pancakes and iced tea.

261
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,850
Just give her a glass of water.

262
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,890
You're so meanie!

263
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,320
I'll have the same thing!

264
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,360
Two pancakes and iced tea, coming.

265
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,390
Akane, I'm disappointed in you.

266
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,370
But why?!

267
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,050
About Time!

268
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,460
About Time!
There's something I want to talk about.

269
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,540
About Time!
For real?! Wait, let's meet up
and tell me in person!

270
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,550
About Time!
I'll listen to you wholeheartedly!

271
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,030
About Time!

272
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,000
About Time!
As I waited for your cold
to go away silently for one week,

273
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,610
As I waited for your cold
to go away silently for one week,

274
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,600
I couldn't get in the mood,

275
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,860
so I could only join three mixers...

276
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,850
And yet when I heard your story...

277
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:50,790
You had to come out with something
that goes beyond the imagination.

278
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,640
I'm disappointed.

279
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:51,950
I'm disappointed.
Nonsense

280
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,610
Nonsense
Isn't three times in a week like,

281
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,020
Nonsense
already full power enough?

282
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:55,940
Gah!

283
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,340
Gah!
I thought I could hear

284
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,350
Gah!
a sweet romance story here!

285
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:58,760
Gah!
a sweet romance story here!
Now, now...

286
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,810
Gah!
Now, now...
Hear me out till the end, will you?

287
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,250
Hear me out till the end, will you?

288
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,900
There's been something
on my mind these days...

289
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,650
In a... rather romantic way.

290
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,390
In order for me to move on too...

291
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,920
I want to fix my super bad flaws...

292
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,920
I might actually have a bad habit
that I'm just not aware of!

293
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,460
I might actually have a bad habit
that I'm just not aware of!
I won't know anything
 about that myself!

294
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,550
I won't know anything
 about that myself!
What's with that weird thought?

295
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,490
Like, I won't be able to date anyone with it...

296
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:30,390
I might have a critical flaw,
so I got scared...

297
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,930
You don't really have any.

298
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,270
Regret...

299
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:36,440
Regret...
If I'm gonna regret it later,
even if I have to put myself to shame,

300
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,940
Regret...
I should've asked the reason
why Takuma dumped me back then...

301
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,310
You can't
do that...

302
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,720
You can't
do that...
Well, that's...

303
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,430
You can't
do that...

304
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,800
You can't
do that...
Welcome!

305
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,190
You can't
do that...

306
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,420
Oh?

307
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,860
- U-Um, Sir?

308
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,740
- I thought I saw a cute girl,
- U-Um, Sir?

309
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,820
- but it's you, Momo!
- U-Um, Sir?

310
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,660
Geh!

311
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,830
Oh, what a coincidence!

312
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,300
- Um, your seats...
- Wh-Who're they?

313
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,340
- Oh, don't mind us!
- The guys in my mixer two days ago!

314
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,850
- We'd love to show you
- They were so forceful

315
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,830
- your seats over here...
- and touched me a lot, so I bailed.

316
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,780
Just what kind of people
you go to mixers with?

317
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,170
It's my acquaintance's acquaintances...

318
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,050
Can we share a table?

319
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,910
No way, no way!

320
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,180
Oh, hello to the friend too.

321
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,040
What to drink now?

322
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,520
Really sorry about this!

323
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,180
I'll do something about them,
so just ignore them!

324
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,780
Isn't it a bit forceful of you?

325
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,420
Momo's not feeling comfortable.

326
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,079
Right? We really are a handful, eh?

327
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,320
Momo, you didn't pay the bill
the other day, right?

328
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,830
Huh? I gave the money
to the organiser, though?

329
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,080
Huh? I didn't know anything about it.

330
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,570
Have you checked with the person?

331
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, who cares about the bill?
Let's have fun together!

332
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,460
At this rate,
they're gonna sit here for a while...

333
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,860
Momo, you smell so good!

334
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,380
I can't! You're too close!

335
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,360
Hey!

336
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,190
Thank you for waiting.

337
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,850
Here's your chunky soufflé
pancakes and iced tea.

338
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,170
Huh?

339
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,980
Oh? It was for four, again?

340
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,250
E-Eita...

341
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,150
Sasaki, actually...

342
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,650
Oh, my.

343
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,030
Oh, we're friends with them.

344
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,200
Don't mind us.

345
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,220
Wow, Eita! Help Us!

346
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,790
Wow, Eita! Help Us!
Yay!

347
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,660
I'm sorry, Sir, but you're troubling

348
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,990
I'm sorry, Sir, but you're troubling
Kyah

349
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,680
Kyah
the other customers,

350
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,420
Kyah
so let me take you to another table.

351
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:30,440
so let me take you to another table.

352
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,220
We'll be fine here.

353
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,480
We are really sorry,

354
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,220
but you're really troubling
the other customers,

355
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,440
so please move to another table.

356
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,190
Well, we...

357
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,260
Thank you for your cooperation.

358
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,310
Thanks, Eita.

359
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,560
Fancy seeing you here!

360
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,200
That was surprising!
I didn't notice you at all!

361
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,770
I noticed you, though.

362
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:02,550
What? You should've said hi!

363
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,930
It'd be more fun if I kept quiet.

364
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,410
A friend of hers?

365
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,710
U-Um... Sorry for causing trouble to the cafe.

366
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,750
Not at all.

367
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,100
Whew, that was surprising.

368
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,850
Good thing Eita was here.

369
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,970
He was really hot.

370
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,650
Eita is also in the same guild as me.

371
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,600
Aww!

372
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,450
Huh?! Him too?!

373
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,830
Yeah! He's the guild master!

374
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,330
That game you're playing
has more hope than any mixer...

375
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:44,670
That game you're playing
has more hope than any mixer...
I Wonder...

376
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,410
I Wonder...
I suddenly feel empty now...

377
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,880
I Wonder...

378
00:19:56,810 --> 00:20:00,130
Momo, about earlier...

379
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,140
Good work today.

380
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,650
Keep Things Tidy

381
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,910
Keep Things Tidy
Good work! Oh, you got a minute, Sasaki?

382
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,220
Keep Things Tidy
Huh? No.

383
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,520
Keep Things Tidy

384
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:15,220
After all, I'm already off my shift.

385
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,150
I'm not talking about work.

386
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,470
We're going for a karaoke with the guys
from the noon shift. Want to tag along?

387
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,910
You did save my bacon too earlier,
so it's on me.

388
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,000
I have a cute sister
waiting for me home, so no.

389
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,300
Geh

390
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,100
Geh
What a siscon.

391
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,000
Geh
How rude.

392
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,700
I just have too much affection for her,
so I'm a siscon.

393
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,010
So you admit it?

394
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:35,800
Sasaki

395
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,010
Sasaki
Thanks for today.

396
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:37,510
Sasaki

397
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,330
Um, Eita!

398
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,370
Oh, you two are still here?

399
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,270
What are you doing?
There's nothing here.

400
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,270
We were waiting for you.

401
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:53,520
Awwie
Oh, you were waiting for a star's exit?

402
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:53,770
Oh, you were waiting for a star's exit?
Awwie

403
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,020
Oh, you were waiting for a star's exit?
Awwie

404
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,270
Oh, you were waiting for a star's exit?
Awwie

405
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,520
Oh, you were waiting for a star's exit?
Awwie

406
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:54,770
Oh, you were waiting for a star's exit?
Awwie

407
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,030
Oh, you were waiting for a star's exit?
Awwie

408
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,140
Oh, you were waiting for a star's exit?
Awwie

409
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:55,280
Awwie
Huh? Now that's a mysterious personality.

410
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,530
Huh? Now that's a mysterious personality.
Awwie

411
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:55,780
Huh? Now that's a mysterious personality.
Awwie

412
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,030
Huh? Now that's a mysterious personality.
Awwie

413
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,280
Huh? Now that's a mysterious personality.
Awwie

414
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:56,530
Huh? Now that's a mysterious personality.
Awwie

415
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:56,780
Huh? Now that's a mysterious personality.
Awwie

416
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:56,900
Huh? Now that's a mysterious personality.
Awwie

417
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,370
There's something I want to talk about.

418
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:09,500
Is that okay?

419
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,250
Let's go, then.
Have you checked your gear?

420
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,110
Yes.

421
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,930
Yes!

422
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,230
I need to show her my good sides!

423
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,300
Her gear...

424
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,490
Staring at Her Gear

425
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,420
Wait, is your gear
a bit different than mine?

426
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,080
Huh?

427
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,840
It's so cool!

428
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:18,920
N-Not at all...

429
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,000
N-Not at all...
You can obtain that
if you do the main quests

430
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,840
You can obtain that
if you do the main quests

431
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,650
Hey, how do you obtain these?

432
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:27,350
You just have to clear
the starter quests...

433
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,850
Yeah, and then?

434
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,850
If anything,
Akane with maxed out default gear,

435
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,020
is probably the rarest breed of all.

436
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,520
Nice

437
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,020
Default Equipment
 Maxed Out

438
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:38,520
GPU Maxed Out

439
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,020
HP Maxed Out!
