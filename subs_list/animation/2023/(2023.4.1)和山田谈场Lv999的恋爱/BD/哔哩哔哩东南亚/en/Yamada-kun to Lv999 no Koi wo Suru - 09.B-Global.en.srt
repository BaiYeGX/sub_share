You're eligible for our lottery campaign!

11
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,330
Please pick one.

12
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,500
So...

13
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,440
- You're going to shop tomorrow? You are, right?
The Convo in FOS Last Night

14
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,820
The Convo in FOS Last Night
- You're going to shop tomorrow? You are, right?
- The reason you insisted me to go was this...?

15
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,550
The Convo in FOS Last Night
- You should come to my store!
- The reason you insisted me to go was this...?

16
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,130
The Convo in FOS Last Night
- There's something to look forward to!
- Come on, you're on

17
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:27,260
That eating habit is
really bad for you
- your way home from school, too.

18
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,250
That eating habit is
really bad for you
- your way home from school, too.
The one near my room is
also doing this

19
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,040
That eating habit is
really bad for you
The one near my room is
also doing this
You'll be buying food as well
as you walk home, right?

20
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,640
That eating habit is
really bad for you
The one near my room is
also doing this
Well, yeah.

21
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,230
Been a while since we saw each other
at the festival. Is Runa well?

22
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,890
Yes. She seems to be doing well in her study.

23
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,370
You Got a Cup Ramen!

24
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,020
You Got a Cup Ramen!
I see.

25
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:40,640
I see.

26
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,610
She sometimes calls me,
but we rarely meet offline.

27
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:45,940
Oh, is he your friend, Akane?

28
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,400
Oh, is he your friend, Akane?
Part-Time Comrade
Mrs. Shinohara (Housewife)

29
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,620
Part-Time Comrade
Mrs. Shinohara (Housewife)
Mrs. Shinohara.

30
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,910
Part-Time Comrade
Mrs. Shinohara (Housewife)
He looks so cool.

31
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,270
He looks so cool.

32
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,570
He is! We met in a video game.

33
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,980
He's got a pretty face,
just like an actor.

34
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,910
It makes my heart skip a beat.

35
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,390
I'll excuse me...

36
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,170
I'll be done in a sec,
so let's go home together!

37
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,890
He's waiting so patiently outside.

38
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,910
Is he your boyfriend?

39
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,680
No, he's not.

40
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,520
He doesn't seem to be
too fond of girls, so he's not.

41
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,020
Oh, what a waste.

42
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,530
He heh

43
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,780
He heh
But you do like him, don't you, Akane?

44
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,710
I mean, you desperately tried to stop him.

45
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,910
Uh... I'm not sure.

46
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,190
Uh... I'm not sure.
This is so fun!

47
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,190
This is so fun!
Gosh!

48
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:01,320
This is so fun!
The way you reply is so like a pure maiden!

49
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:01,790
This is so fun!

50
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,120
Sure, compared to when we first met,

51
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,730
Sure, compared to when we first met,
I'm not interested

52
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,080
I'm not interested
I feel like he's opened up a lot to me now...

53
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,290
I'm not interested
I feel like he's opened up a lot to me now...
What a drag...
I wanna go home

54
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:09,630
I'm not interested

55
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,550
Kinoshita

56
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,660
I do think that he really is...

57
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,770
Hello.

58
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,300
...a nice guy.

59
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,870
Thanks for waiting!

60
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
Even if we're just connected through a game,

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,560
it makes me happy
that we can get along through that.

62
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,570
But that also includes Eita and Runa, right?

63
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,150
But that also includes Eita and Runa, right?
It's a Big Disaster for  the  Guild!!

64
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,070
It's a Big Disaster for  the  Guild!!

65
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,320
I didn't ask you to come for the lottery.

66
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:45,090
Actually, I made you lunch as a thank you
for helping me, so I wanted to give it to you.

67
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,040
A thank you?

68
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,580
For my PC.

69
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,190
I couldn't really say
thank you during the festival.

70
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,710
I don't really mind.

71
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:56,550
I've finally escaped my broke status recently,

72
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,970
so expect great stuff inside the box.

73
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,600
I don't know why,

74
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,400
but I can't see him as a candidate
for my boyfriend...

75
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,090
Feels like I'm not allowed to...

76
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:18,180
Shoot, I just sneezed in front of
a third year about to take his exam.

77
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,240
Caught a cold?

78
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,120
I dunno.

79
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,960
Where's my mask?

80
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,240
Found it yet?

81
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:37,970
Found it.

82
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,140
I hope it doesn't get worse.

83
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,520
Your cold, I mean.

84
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,440
Yeah...

85
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,400
Thanks.

86
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:16,350
The distant look...

87
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,800
The distant look...
Don't you think guys who are unaware

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,090
The distant look...
that they're nice are scary?

89
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,680
Go on.

90
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:29,220
When I let my guard down,
I might fall under the illusion,

91
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,880
that he might actually fall for me,
but he's not really into it at all.

92
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,330
It's just a scary trap,
with him exercising his kindness to me.

93
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,320
There's only one thing I want to confirm...

94
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,450
How can you claim that he can't fall for you?

95
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:43,640
How can you claim that he can't fall for you?

96

Also, can I make this a bit extravagant?

97
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,440

The theme will be the night butterfly.

98
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,950
Still learning

Please don't. They'll scold me at work.

99
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,080
While you don't mention the subject,
you must be talking about Yamada, right?

100
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,090
While you don't mention the subject,
you must be talking about Yamada, right?
Ohh

101
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:55,820
Ohh
Yep.

102
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,590
Ohh
Weren't you happy after he called you
a flower on a high peak?

103
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,750
Weren't you happy after he called you
a flower on a high peak?

104
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,530
That shouldn't have a deeper meaning too...

105
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,970
That's why it's scary...

106
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,240
If a younger handsome man said
something like that as a trick or something,

107
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,480
I'd have struck him straight away.

108
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:13,980
Night Butterfly

109
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,730
Night Butterfly
I don't know what makes you so fidgety.

110
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,100
Night Butterfly
I don't know what makes you so fidgety.
What do
you think?

111
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,730
Night Butterfly
I don't know what makes you so fidgety.
What do
you think?
Nope

112
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,860
Night Butterfly
What do
you think?
Nope
I'm not fidgety...

113
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,110
Really? It seems to me
that you're most fidgety these days.

114
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,740
You always talk about Yamada so happily,
probing your own feelings.

115
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,210
You never tell what you
want to do at all right?

116
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,500
If you don't tell,
I won't be able to comment.

117
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,680
Touche, Ma'am...

118
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,850
So the butterfly...

119
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,840
That's still a no.

120
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,180
Runa Sasaki

121
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,130
Runa Sasaki
Oh, it's Runa.

122
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,970
Runa Sasaki
Oh, I remember her.

123
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,350
Oh, I remember her.

124
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,030
The Lolita middle schooler.

125
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:53,850
Yep.

126
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,100
Hello?

127
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,230
Akane, can we meet right now?!

128
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,480
It's a big disaster for the guild!

129
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,490
Runa!

130
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,340
Thanks for waiting?

131
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,650
Is it okay for you to be
outside at this hour?

132
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,310
It's getting darker.

133
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,500
I came here by taxi, so I'm good.

134
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,670
I'll be going home by taxi too.

135
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,470
That's great, then.

136
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,840
Anyway, I actually met with...

137
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,480
Wait, did you read my message?!

138
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,920
Well, yeah, I did.

139
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,770
So we have a new member in our guild.

140
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,740
Another stranger woman
has joined the guild...

141
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,500
Unbelievable! The guild was meant
to be for our circle only!

142
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,280
I like you now though, Akane!

143
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,350
- She's so exclusive...
- It'll be a completely different guild

144
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,280
after I come back from the entrance exam!

145
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,890
Also, I hate women!

146
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,080
They'll hate me straight away!

147
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,180
They'll hate me straight away!
Must be because
I'm cute?!

148
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,160
Must be because
I'm cute?!
I'm looking forward to it, though.

149
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,420
Grrrrrrr

150
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,490
Grrrrrrr
I hope she's just a girl new to MMO.

151
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,580
Grrrrrrr
Oh, I brought hot chocolate with me, want a can?

152
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,540
Grrrrrrr
Oh, I brought hot chocolate with me, want a can?

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,540

So nonchalant!

With that being said,

156
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,030
Top Secret
No Peeking
I've come up with plans to drive her away.

157
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,550
Top Secret
No Peeking
Hey!

158
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,170
The newbie must be anxious,
so we must greet her warmly, okay?

159
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:19,220
Besides, maybe we can get along
with her if we get to know her.

160
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,940
Just like the two of us.

161
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,730
When you think that you get to know someone
who you normally won't meet in real life...

162
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:36,870
Isn't it exciting?

163
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,582
That's why I hate it!

164
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:42,418
I bet you'll get along fast with that girl!

165
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:45,970
Then, you'll start hanging out with
her more than with me, right?!

166
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:48,910
That's not true.
We haven't even met yet...

167
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,180
That's definitely true!

168
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,560
That's definitely true!
What...

169
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,550
What...
We could just get along well together...

170
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,140
I hate odd numbers!
There'll be an extra!

171
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,430
Let's get along together, okay?

172
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,740
Okay?

173
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,760
I'll just let it
pass with a sip...

174
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,120
I'll just let it
pass with a sip...
It feels like having a girlfriend

175
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,380
I'll just let it
pass with a sip...
who's easily jealous.

176
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,360
Well, I knew it all along, though.

177
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,690
You're that kind of person, after all.

178
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,740
Even my brother...

179
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,470
He said our new member
is brought in by Yamada,

180
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,180
so I better greet her properly.

181
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:25,960
Yamada did?

182
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,800
Yamada did?
I'll have the chocolate

183
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,960
I'll have the chocolate
She's his classmate.

184
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,590
I'll have the chocolate
Originally, she's an FPS gamer girl, apparently.

185
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,710
She said she could use
an MMO as a distraction.

186
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,720
They seem to be good friends too.

187
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,980
When I asked
who she is on the phone...

188
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,920
Tell me!

189
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,980
She's just a normal girl.

190
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,610
Yamada wouldn't tell much.

191
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,360
He said if I bully her like I did you,
he'd be real mad...

192
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:50,920
He said if I bully her like I did you,
he'd be real mad...
I haven't done
anything, though...

193
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,880
I haven't done
anything, though...

194
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,100
I haven't done
anything, though...
A girl on good terms with Yamada...

195
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,110
I haven't done
anything, though...

196
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,830
I didn't expect Yamada
to actually invite a girl.

197
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,090
Huh? Well, yeah.

198
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,380
Anyway, I've thought of a good idea!

199
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,680
Give me your phone!

200
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,380
Yamada

201
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,440
What are you doing?

202
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,420
Inputting Yamada's number to your phone.

203
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,130
You call him yourself, Akane!

204
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,390
He seems to be wary of me,
but I bet he'll tell you!

205
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,410
If I know what kind of girl she is,

206
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,140
I'll feel at ease!

207
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,120
I'll feel at ease!

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,130
So, I heard they started
dating just like that.

211
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:29,650
For real?

212
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,650
Didn't they say they're both
not suited for each other?

213
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,160
But still, they're a man and a woman.

214
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,700
Even though it's impossible,

215
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,980
they might actually hook up
over the most trivial reasons.

216
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,140
So dating someone can start
from a trivial reason?

217
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,830
Hello, Class Rep.

218
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,570
Hello, Okamata, Yamada.

219
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:56,410
Hey.

220
00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:00,790
Anyway, it's kind of funny for you
to mumble on you own while coming here.

221
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,060
Huh? I was asking you two, though.

222
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,680
Huh? I was asking you two, though.
Sorry about that

223
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,190
Sorry about that
Dating, huh? Well...

224
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:10,080
You're really gonna ask that to us?
History of Life without a GF = As the Age Shows

225
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,280
History of Life without a GF = As the Age Shows
Hobby = Game
I suppose not.

226
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,200
Oh, right. Thanks for the invitation, Yamada.

227
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,190
And for talking with the master about me.

228
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,450
Sure.

229
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,930
What's that?

230
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,270
A game.

231
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,820
Oh, FOS?

232
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,710
I've just started playing,

233
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,680
then I heard that it'd give me
the upper hand to join a strong guild.

234
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:29,250
So I asked Yamada to let me join his.

235
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,390
So I asked Yamada to let me join his.
Can i eat
the hamburger?

236
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:30,500
Can i eat

You're a closet gamer, after all.

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,820
I'm not really trying to hide it...

240
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,520
I just can't talk about it with other girls,
since they talk a lot about romance.

241
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,770
Sho ywou're intwested in womance stooff?

242
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,550
Not really...

243
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,310
So you've devoted your life to gaming?

244
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:00,450
Not gonna pick that up?

245
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,280
Not gonna pick that up?
It's vibrating

Oh, they hung up.

You Have 1 Missed Call

253
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,830
You've been getting a lot of calls, huh?

254
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,960
Maybe it's a confession from a stranger woman?

255
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,210
Maybe it's a confession from a stranger woman?
There shouldn't
be anything like
that normally

256
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,740
You could actually get one if you...

257
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,220
Yamada...

258
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,610
He's not really fond of
romance stuff, am I right?

259
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,140
So loud...
That was shocking...

260
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,780
Well, yes...

261
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,530
Right.

262
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,030
I'm famished!

263
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,250
Great Scott... I'm dying...

264
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,500
Didn't you eat a hamburger just now?

265
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,490
I want a hamburger...

266
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,410
Again?

267
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,330
I'll also buy potatoes next...

268
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,400
Huh? Hey, are you listening?

269
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,300
I'm on the phone.

270
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Oh, you're calling
the unknown number earlier?

271
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,540
If she's a girl with a cute voice,
let me talk to her!

272
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,660
Gonna ignore me?

Hello?

276
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,550
Sorry about earlier...

277
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,450
Yamada?

278
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,780
It's me, Akane!

279
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,490
Akane?

280
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,150
It really is a girl.

281
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,490
Huh? How'd you get my number?

282
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,190
Huh? How'd you get my number?
Heheheh

283
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,240
Heheheh
Right.

284
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,210
Sorry for suddenly calling you.

285
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,920
I met Runa earlier in the evening.

286
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,510
You okay?

287
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:37,360
Yeah... Anyway,
there's something I want to ask you,

288
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,470
but I'm about to go to work now.

289
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:40,560
but I'm about to go to work now.
Welcome!

290
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,040
Welcome!

291
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,470
Welcome!
But you've already worked today...

292
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:46,580
The manager couldn't seem
to contact the night shifter, so...

293
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,860
I got called suddenly...

294
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,960
Isn't there any other stand-ins?

295
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,460
Nope, I don't think so.

296
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,050
My apartment's near,
so I can be summoned pretty quick.

297
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:57,980
I see.

298
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,970
Yamada, you...

299
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,710
Yes?

300
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,100
His voice sounds quiet on the phone.

301
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,870
It's nothing.

306
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,130
Wow
I'm surprised you could tell.

307
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,650
Wow
I heard you call her name.

308
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,090
Wow

309
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,790
She's in the same guild in FOS.

310
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,260
I'm sure you'll eventually meet her too.

311
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,100
I see.

312
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,000
You seem to be good
friends in real life too.

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,560
Well, right.

314
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,280
Our master's my senior
from the neighbourhood.

315
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:39,160
I can't remember... her face.

316
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
What kind of person?

317
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,240
Huh? Our master?

318
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,120
No, that Akane person.

319
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,290
Akane...

320
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,470
My ex-boyfriend!

321
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,890
Did I just cross the line overnight?!

322
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,880
Yamara!

323
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,590
She always
looks weird...

324
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,130
Yamada!

325
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,860
I don't really know.

326
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,150
Could it be...

327
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,070
...that you like her?

328
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,910
Sorry, Akane!

329
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,540
The night shift guy's out of reach,
and I alone can't run the store!

330
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,540
You should've just fired
that quitter already!

331
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,470
It's really a bother
R-Right...

332
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,650
It's really a bother
But I can't really hate

333
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,890
It's really a bother
the guy with the guitar!

334
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,550
It's really a bother
Oh, I'll treat you something as an apology.

335
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:50,080
What about tomorrow night?
I know a good place...

336
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,680
Not going!

337
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,020
Not going!
I'll just eat in my apartment

338
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,060
I'll just eat in my apartment

339
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,120
I'm feeling cold,
so I was hoping to go to bed soon...

00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,070
It feels strange seeing
Yamada's name in my call history.

342
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,990
All right, time to work.

343
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,470
You never tell what you
want to do at all right?

344
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,430
Akane!

345
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,180
Coming!

346
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,770
Oh, shoot!

347
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,360
Would You Like to Log in to Aria 5 Server?

348
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,750
You Have Received an Invitation to the Guild Chocolate Rabbit from Rurihime. Would You Like to Accept?

349
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,720
I don't have any regrets,

350
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,220
but I think just now...

351
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,730
Sorry, Akane.

352
00:17:22,836 --> 00:17:24,164
There's something I actually regret.

Oh, it's Akane.

355
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,750
Oh, it's Akane.

356
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,020
I'm tired already

357
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,230
I'm tired already
Can I pick it up?

358
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,990
I'm tired already
Go ahead?

359
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,000
Akane, what's up?
I'm having my tutor session now.

360
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,500
Runa...

361
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,880
Geh! What's with your voice?!
You sound
like a zombie!

362
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,460
A cold?

363
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,690
So you can't play tonight?

364
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,080
Is that so...

365
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,760
No, it's okay. It is what it is.

366
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,940
Get well soon.

367
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,270
Akane said she caught a cold.

368
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,270
Akane said she caught a cold.
We promised to play
FOS together tonight...

369
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,570
She sounded like dying earlier.
Will she be okay?

370
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,290
I hope it's nothing serious.

371

Pafron Gold A

373
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,140
My throat burns like hell,
I can't drink water...

374
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,940
I gotta drink my medicine...

375
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,580
It's Pretty Serious

376
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,690
It's Pretty Serious
Wait, I gotta eat something first...

377
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,790
Wait, I gotta eat something first...

378
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,660
I haven't eaten anything since yesterday...

379
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,960
Break time...

380
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,570
A Little Rest

381
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,200
A Little Rest
I'm beat...

382
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:01,220
I'm beat...

383
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,580
Also, now out of all days...

384
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,020
Also, now out of all days...

I feel so...

387
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,460
I feel so...

388
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:06,780
I feel so...
Calling
Momo

389
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,370
Calling
Momo
- The number you are calling cannot be reached...

390
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,590
Calling
Momo
- ...unlucky.
- The number you are calling cannot be reached...

391
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,650
But...

392
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,620
Weep as I may,
no one's coming to save me.

393
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,070
If I don't move,
I'll only face death.

394
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,510
Need to eat something.

395
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,380
Maybe porridge or something?

396
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,350
Gotta buy something...

397
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,850
I got no rice left...

398
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,020
I'll just spread the cold, so no bus...

399
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,450
Oh, yeah. The bike.

400
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,090
All right, my thoughts are still running.

401
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,530
Please give me some energy
to survive the night...

402
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,700
I can't ride a bike...
Like, it's so out of question...

403
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,110
I feel hot...

404
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,440
Why didn't I just order online?

405
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,600
How come I didn't realise?

406
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,080
Right, I could just order online.

407
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:27,710
Running thoughts.

408
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,580
Before that...

409
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,590
I need to fix the bikes...

410
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,250
Then I'll go back to my room...

411
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,720
What was I supposed to do, again...?

412
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,680
My head hurts...

413
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,020
Akane.

414
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,760
What... I'm seeing someone
who looks like Yamada...

415
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,660
But, there's no way
he's in my apartment...

416
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,610
Can you hear me?

417
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,270
A dream?

418
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,980
Oh, boy...

419
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,640
He's finally in my dream now...

420
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,130
Sorry, Yamada.

421
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:31,650
Sorry for seeing such
a convenient dream.

422
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,330
Butterfly, butterfly...

423
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,870
Land on me!

424
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:17,400
The night butterfly, Momoko Maeda.

425
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,130
Today, I will meet
the destined prince of mine...?!

426
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,090

Soothing Girl

427

428
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,520
Excuse me! I want a refill!

429
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,140
Excuse me! I want a refill!
Akane

430
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,320
Akane
Get me a strong gin.

431
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,020
Akane

432
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,450
Momo's not picking up...
