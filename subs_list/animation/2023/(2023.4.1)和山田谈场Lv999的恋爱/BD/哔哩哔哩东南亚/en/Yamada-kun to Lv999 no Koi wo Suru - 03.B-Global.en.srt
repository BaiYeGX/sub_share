00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,740
Oh, so you're single now, Kinoshita?

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,480
Kinoshita
Ah, yes.

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:07,490
Kinoshita

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:11,180
How about me?
I make a good boyfriend, you know?

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,470
What?

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,910
Oh, so that's what it is!
Interesting!

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,880
What?

8
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,880
I wanna go home

9
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,380
Not a chance

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,160
Smile

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,540
Smile
I arranged this mixer for you, you know?

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,890
Smile
I'm sorry, it was too early for me.
I wanna go home.

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:32,970
Smile
I'm sorry, it was too early for me.
I wanna go home.

The Kind of Convo Only Possible By Girls' Unique Staring

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,640
Kinoshita, you grinding a game now, right?

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,890
Kinoshita, you grinding a game now, right?
I heard about it

17
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,100
Kinoshita, you grinding a game now, right?

18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,680
What's it called?

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,300
I do smartphone games all the time,
so we could multi sometime if you like.

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,860
Uh, not a smartphone game...

21
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,160
It's a PC game called Forest of Savor...

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,900
Ahh...

23
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:57,150
I... Uhh...

24
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,580
I think I saw it in a commercial...

25
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,580
Err, yeah...

26
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:03,830
A very tryhard comment

27
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,790
A very tryhard comment
Yeah, I saw it!

28
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,960
A very tryhard comment
Sorry about this.

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,600
Oh, I mean...

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,790
Uhh... That "Forest", huh...

31
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,970
Savor...

32
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,560
Gosh, are you actually serious about this?

33
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,020
I got you into a nice mixer, and you had
to fiddle with your phone all the time!

34
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,710
You're not serious, are you?

35
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:55,410
Sorry, Ruri kept sending me messages,
so I just had to...

36
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,830
Ruri?

37
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,870
Yeah, she's my MMO friend.

38
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,480
She's a girl with a cute avatar.

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,640
A girl?

40
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,870
Huh? Yeah.

41
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:09,630
What if it's actually a weird
old man behind the screen?

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,950
Won't it be dangerous
to give your number?

43
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,220
I think... she's a girl?

44
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,060
Oh, well.

45
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,850
I'm going this way, then. Bye-bye.

I Wanna Do an
Offline  Meeting

47
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,650
Now that she mentioned it...

48
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,280
I just got back from a drinking party,
I'll log in once i get home!
Rurihime
Wanna log in today?
Akane!
Yep!

49
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,570
I just got back from a drinking party,
I'll log in once i get home!
Rurihime
Wanna log in today?
Akane!
Yep!
I've never thought about it...

50
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,860
I'm done with the party! I'll log in as soon as i get home!

51
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,080
I'm done with the party! I'll log in as soon as i get home!
I'm almost home too! Let's play together once we've logged in!

52
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,780
I imagine her as a girl around
the age of high school...

53
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,690
But what does she actually look like?

54
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,940
Wow... a goth loli?

55
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,820
No... a Yumekawa style?

56
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,190
I can't tell

57
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,600
I can't tell
She looked just like Rurihime somehow.

58
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,840
She looked just like Rurihime somehow.

59
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,399
All right, my classes tomorrow
start in the afternoon,

60
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,910
so I can game all night now!

61
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,540
Questioning Herself for Getting
Excited More over a Game than a Mixer

62
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,710
Oh, whatever.

63
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,780
Oh, whatever.
She Stopped Thinking

64
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,790
She Stopped Thinking

65
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,750
I still can't enjoy
romance for now, anyway.

66
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:40,050
Akane Has Logged In

67
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,730
Huh?

68
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,410
No one's in the guild room...

69
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,670
It's Rurihime and Yamada!

70
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,820
What are they doing out there?

71
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,570
I could use a hunt session
with these two.

72
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,650
Let's see...

73
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,580
Rurihime: None of our members have logged in but us today...

74
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,080
Rurihime: None of our members have logged in but us today...
Actually Here

75
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,290
Rurihime: None of our members have logged in but us today...

76
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,540
Rurihime: Feels so lonely~ Akane's still not coming too...
Rurihime: None of our members have logged in but us today...

77
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,290
Yamada: Today's a weekday, so yeah
Rurihime: None of our members have logged in but us today...
Rurihime: Feels so lonely~ Akane's still not coming too...

78
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,710
She said earlier she'd be coming, though~
Rurihime: Feels so lonely~ Akane's still not coming too...
Rurihime: None of our members have logged in but us today...
Yamada: Today's a weekday, so yeah

79
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,370
Huh?

80
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,300
Aren't they aware of my presence?

81
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,220
This takes me back to back when we started the guild

82
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,740
This takes me back to back when we started the guild

83
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,640
This takes me back to back when we started the guild
This takes me back to back
when we started the guild.

84
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,830
This takes me back to back
when we started the guild.

85
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,780
Right...

86
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,560
We used to be alone
all the day back then.

87
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,750
But we've got more people now...

88
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,570
Still, it's fine for us
to be alone too sometimes.

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,070
As much as I enjoy
the fun together with everyone,

90
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,970
I get to spend less
time alone with you,

91
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,830
so it kind of feels lonely.

92
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,330
Well...

93
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,570
Things were much easier back
when there were only two of us.

94
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,450
Wha...

95
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,160
These two...

96
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,230
They're so ready!

97
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,470
It's ready now.

98
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:04,940
It's ready now.

A Circle She Somehow Can't Enter

102
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,900
Maybe I should learn it too...

103
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,620
By the way, we have another
member here among us.

104
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,400
Huh?

105
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,150
Oh, it's Akane!

106
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,910
I missed the System Log notice!

107
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,850
Sorry, Akane!

108
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,410
Akane: Hello! Umm, am I interrupting?

109
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,410
Huh? No way!

110
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,910
Smile

111
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,760
I got something to do,
so I'll log out now.

112
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,790
Okay! I'll call you later!

113
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,260
Call?!

114
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,920
Sure.

115
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,880
Yamada Has Logged Out

116
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,260
Yamada Has Logged Out
Bye-bye!

117
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:46,550
Yamada Has Logged Out

118
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,430
Come to think of it...

119
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,140
Yamada would never try
to get involved with anyone,

120
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,690
but he'd always talk with Rurihime, huh?

121
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,030
What if they were actually...

122
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,740
...a couple in real life?

123
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,800
Just like when Takuma and I
started playing the game,

124
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,050
maybe Yamada and Ruri will...

125
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,460
Akane?

126
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,880
You're not feeling well?

127
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,340
That's not it!

128
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,050
Why am I...

129
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,200
...feeling a bit blue now?

130
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,600
\hRurihime
\hThanks for today!

131
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,230
\hRurihime
\hThanks for today!
\hSee you later

132
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,710
Sure, see you later

133
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:56,100
Sure, see you later
Why am I so curious about those two?

134
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,410
Sure, see you later

135
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:59,680
The Arab Spring that took
place in the Arab world,

136
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,160
which started in North Africa,

137
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,930
was backed by the power of SNS
to connect people to people...

138
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:06,920
Just like what this example shows...

Yamada's account...

143
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,450
I want to see it, but...

144
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,440
It feels like I'm prying
into him too much...

145
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,230
Kinoshita!

146
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,430
Hey!

147
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,559
Ah, the guy from the mixer.

148
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,940
What was his name, again?

149
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,000
So you were in the same lecture as me.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,590
I saw you fiddling
with your phone from behind.

151
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,380
No way!

152
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,970
I didn't realise you were there.

153
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,900
Uh, his name...

154
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,650
Shoot, I can't remember.

155
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,650
By the way, I started looking
into Forest of Savor since then.

156
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,990
So it's a pretty famous game, eh?

157
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,340
Seems like it.

158
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,640
I think I'm interested
in playing it too now.

159
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,970
I love games, after all.

160
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,020
There's a lot of guys
who play games, huh...

You also do FPS games?

164
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,760
F what?

165
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,840
Know a pro gamer
by the name of Yamada?

166
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,620
Oh, yeah... Yamada...

167
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,970
Err...

168
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,100
I think I saw him in a commercial.

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,670
I think I saw him in a commercial.
A very
tryhard comment

170

A very
tryhard comment
Told you, I'm sorry.

171
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,530
You really do love games,
don't you, Kinoshita?

172
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,090
I don't know why...

173
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,300
...but I keep feeling gloomy...

174
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:37,040
So, our circle will be
going to Okinawa this summer.

175
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,850
Sounds fun.

176
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,160
It is!

177
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,730
They're all fun people.

178
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,950
Maybe you should join us too?

179
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,670
Huh?

180
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,290
I remember that girl...

181
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,610
I think I saw her the other day...

182
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,000
Sorry I'm late.

183
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,830
Let's go.

184
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,140
The hotel we usually
book has an ocean view...

185
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,580
I've never had a girlfriend either.

186
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,760
Well, he's cool and all,

187
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,510
so of course...

188
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,740
...he'd have a girlfriend or two.

189
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,940
Kinoshita?

190
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,210
I'm going this way, then. Bye.

191
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,350
Wait, Kinoshita...

192
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,500
See you at college!

193
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:38,970
And yet...

194
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,410
Why am I feeling so fuzzy?

195
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,950
I don't think I should log in today...

196
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,930
Who is it?

197
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,700
Momo?

198
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,130
Hello, Akane! You free today?\h

199
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,670
Hello, Akane! You free today?\h
Rurihime?

200
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,000
Hello, Akane! You free today?\h

201
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:28,580
What do I do?
I don't feel like gaming today...

202
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,770
Hello, Ruri! What's up?

203
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,230
Hello, Ruri! What's up?
Akane! Have you seen FOS news?

204
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,830
Hello, Ruri! What's up?
Akane! Have you seen FOS news?
FOS News?

205
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,260
Hello, Ruri! What's up?
Akane! Have you seen FOS news?

206
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:39,140
I haven't logged in today, so no.

207
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,740
I haven't logged in today, so no

208
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,320
An FOS collab cafe will open next month! Wanna go there together?

209
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,980
An FOS collab cafe will open next month! Wanna go there together?
Collab cafe...

210
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,020
Oh, right! I happened to meet Yamada IRL earlier and invited him too!
I also wanna invite the other guild members too!

211
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,310
Happened to meet IRL...

212
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,380
Don't tell me...

213
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,460
...that girl is really Rurihime?

214
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,150
Sure, she does have
the same aura as Rurihime...

215
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:09,710
So that means those two are really...

216
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,460
I wanna do an online meeting with you! Can't I?

217
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:14,510
I wanna do an online meeting with you! Can't I?

218
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,800
I wanna do an online meeting with you! Can't I?
Please?

219
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,810
OK, I'll go

220
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:55,800
Morning, Akane! It's finally the day!
I got too excited, i couldn't sleep last night!
I can't wait to see you, Akane!

221
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,810
All right, time to get ready.

222
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,810
Well, it's rare for me
to be meeting fellow guild members,

223
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,820
this'll be my chance.

224
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,580
\hAn offline meeting for an MMO?

225
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,950
\hAn offline meeting for an MMO?
\hWill you be okay? I mean, you've never even met those people, right?

226
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:35,210
Don't worry! They're all nice people!
Yamada will be there too!

227
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,960
Oh, Yamada will be there too? That's reassuring

228
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,210
Oh, Yamada will be there too? That's reassuring
Have fun then~

229
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,340
I'll do just that!

230
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,900
Now...

231
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,480
Murata Building

232
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,820
Murata Building
The Murata Building north of the station...

233
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,390
Murata Building

234
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:56,360
Murata Building
If you see it on the left,
go cross the street...

235
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,210
And then...

236
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,540
Let's check the map again.

237
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,870
Osoba

238
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,790
Where?

239
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,060
Stopped

240
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,910
Oh, I'm sorry!

241
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,250
No, I'm sorry, too...

242
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,740
Let me pick it up for you.

243
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,830
I hope it doesn't break.

244
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,840
I hope it doesn't break.
I'm sorry...

245
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,570
I'm sorry...

246
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,240
Are you going to the FOS collab cafe?

247
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,220
Huh?

248
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,360
Are you...

249
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,520
...a player of that game?

250
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,660
It's a pretty casual game, so I heard
the percentage of girls playing is pretty high,

251
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,230
but I never knew someone pretty
like you would play it too.

252
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,900
Uh, well...

253
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,160
He said he'd take me there,

254
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,560
so I went with him,

255
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,200
so I went with him,
He's praising me so much
and being too friendly...

256
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,780
He's praising me so much
and being too friendly...
but what if this is a new way of hitting girls?

257
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,610
He's praising me so much
and being too friendly...

258
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,520
He's praising me so much
and being too friendly...
I started playing with a friend,

259
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,690
I started playing with a friend,

260
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,570
but I got too absorbed,

261
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,030
and we've formed a guild now.

262
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,040
I thought it was just
your run-of-the-mill MMO,

263
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,950
but it's actually a well-balanced game.

264
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,790
What I like most is that you don't
have to whale to get the best stats.

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,270
Well, the graphics are so from last decade,
but it still has its own charm.

266
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,960
Moreover, it has no one OP race.

267
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,170
I'd love to see many
variations of races, too.

268
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,760
I think there's also not one OP job too.

269
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,600
It's a bit biased to the magician job now,

270
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,000
but there's always a perfect
balancing for every update.

271
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,090
There's also a meaning in
guild wars thanks to guild buffs,

272
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,690
so this game must be made
with doing it as a party in mind,

273
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,470
which makes interactions
with the people in game more worth it!

274
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,500
On the other hand,
it's a true grinding hell,

275
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,690
but they made it worth
playing it with a challenge,

276
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,130
it's like the devs actually
listened to the community.

277
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,890
So they finally noticed the failures
with their previous game!

278
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,080
Thank goodness, he's just a gamer.

279
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,270
That's what I think.

280
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,250
How's that?

281
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,890
Uhh...

282
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,310
I'm still a beginner, so I don't know
a lot of stuff like everyone...

283
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,240
I also got scolded the other day for putting
junk in the guild storage too the other day...

284
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,860
But the guild master's so nice to me,

285
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,310
I think I like my current guild.

286
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,780
Oh, he's here!

287
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,120
Hey! Over here!

288
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
Over here!

289
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Hey!

290
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,730
That girl...

291
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,190
She's Rurihime?

292
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,380
So, you're playing that game, Yamada?

293
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,160
Let's 1v1 next time.

294
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,089
Sure.

295
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,190
Yamada!

296
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,560
Long time no see, Yamada!

297
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,760
Yeah, sure.

298
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,819
How are you doing?

299
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:22,810
So-so.

300
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,290
So-so, huh?

301
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,070
Stare

302
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,070
You're Rurihime, right?

303
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:32,110
You're Rurihime, right?
So cute

304
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,050
So cute
Nice to meet you!

305
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,330
So cute
You look just like your character in-game,
so I could tell straight!

306
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,450
Thanks for the message this morning!

307
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,450
Huh?

308
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,980
She's got a different aura
from her in-game character...

309
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:57,980
Huh?

310
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,850
Uhh...

311
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,790
Hey, Eita.

312
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,020
Who is she?

313
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,340
She might be...

314
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:10,230
Akane, right?

315
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:02,900
Um, please get inside for now, everyone...

316
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,270
Izakaya Botta

317
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,180
We're finally here...

318
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,850
Ouch...

319
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,170
Damn, she's heavy...

320
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:30,410
Damn, she's heavy...
An Unconscious
Person Is Heavy

321
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,040
An Unconscious
Person Is Heavy

322
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,190
I'm beat...

323
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:45,720
We're practicing now, but is Yamada offline?

324
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,180
We're practicing now, but is Yamada offline?
It's past 9 now

325
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,980
We're practicing now, but is Yamada offline?
It's past 9 now
Oh, shoot.

326
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,550
We're practicing now, but is Yamada offline?
It's past 9 now
Oh, shoot.
Someone call him

327
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,060
We're practicing now, but is Yamada offline?
It's past 9 now
Someone call him

328
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,070
Yamada Is in a Pro FPS Team

329
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,570
Took your sweet time, eh?
What were you doing?

330
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,650
Everyone's waiting for you!

331
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,380
Sorry, actually...

332
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,580
By chance...

333
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,830
There's a stranger girl
now in my room sleeping...

334
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,920

335
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,000

342
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,120
G-G-Girl?! Did you just say a girl?!

343
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,910
- Unforgivable...
- Did you just say a girl?!

344
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:21,100
You said a girl, right?! Right?!
You said a girl, right?!

345
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,850
- Unforgivable...

346
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,600
- Why do I feel these guys are cursing you?
- Unforgivable...

347
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,970
- Why do I feel these guys are cursing you?
- Unforgivable...
These Pro Gamers Can't
Hide Their Shock

348
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:25,600
These Pro Gamers Can't
Hide Their Shock

349
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,080
Hey, I wanna see a pic!

350
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,510
I won't spread it!
I have a high internet delicacy level!

351
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:31,650
No way.

352
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,550
No way.
What are you on about?

353
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,730
What are you on about?
Have faith in your team members!

354
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,990
Have faith in your team members!

355
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,360
I feel sick...

356
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,300
Show us the image.

357
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,850
Then, thy sins shall be forgiven...

358
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,370
I'll be AFK for a bit.

359
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,290
Oh, wait, Yamada!

360
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,770
This is pissing me off,
so I'll just troll around with your account.

361
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,390
No, you won't.

362
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:52,720
You have low literacy...

363
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,390
Um, you okay?

364
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,140
Need some water?

365
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,610
I don't.

366
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,150
After all...

367
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,780
You don't even love me, right?

368
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,810
Then just...

369
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,330
Get out of my life...

370
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,000
Just go!

371
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,170
Even if you say so...

372
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,220
You're hugging me hard...

373
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,390
Aren't you contradicting yourself?

374
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,000
That's what I'd like to think,
but I don't think it's right...

375
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,340
I can't deal with
 a woman's heart

376
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,940
I can't deal with
 a woman's heart
I don't get it...

377
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,430
I can't deal with
 a woman's heart

378
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,710
But...

379
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,670
If I move now...

380
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,330
I feel like she's gonna cry more.

381
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Finally asleep...

382
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,750
She's always been crying
the whole day.

383
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,150
Just how depressed is she?

384
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,110
It must be... rough.

385
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,090
Romance, that is.

386
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,010
Just sleep quietly there.

387
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:39,690
I'm throwing up!
