1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,689
I wake up every morning with a sigh.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,840
And this became a habit
before I knew it.

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,910
I thought that love...

4
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,930
...was supposed to be
more fun than this.

5
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,940
Wow, you're exactly right on time.

6
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,770
I didn't think you'd be coming early.

7
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,270
Sorry.

8
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,190
It's fine.

9
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:13,950
I'm sure...

10
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,510
that I'll be rejected by him...

11
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,280
I've been in love with you
since freshman year.

12
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,290
Did you notice that?

13
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,390
No.

14
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,550
Of course.

15
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,210
I hid it so you wouldn't notice.

16
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,050
I didn't want you to find out
about my feelings.

17
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,210
That was all I thought about.

18
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,450
I'm sure...

19
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,810
...today is the end of it.

20
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,490
But today when I woke up,
I thought about it.

21
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,570
I have to stop pretending
that I don't like you.

22
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,320
After that, I'll feel better.

23
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,790
That's why...

24
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,200
I won't have any regrets.

25
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,110
I want you to listen to me
for a moment.

26
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,960
Okay.

27
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,950
I like your playstyle.

28
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:11,710
Huh?

29
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,310
I'm talking about games.

30
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,710
You're very calm
and don't blame others.

31
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,720
Ah...

32
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:21,560
A lot of people lose their temper
when playing pvp games,

33
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,610
but you never show that side of you.

34
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,230
Oh...

35
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:27,570
I really like that mature side of you.

36
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,180
Thank you...

37
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,230
And I like that whenever you daydream in class,
you always gaze out the window.

38
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:33,990
Huh?

39
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,460
I didn't want to seem like just another fangirl,
so I never said it,

40
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,330
but I've always thought
your face was really cool,

41
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,600
and I really like
that you don't show it off.

42
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,270
I also like your voice.

43
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,540
It's very relaxing.

44
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,870
I like how quiet you are.

45
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,250
I like how you look
when you walk and run.

46
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,130
I like how you talk slowly.

47
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,130
Your habit of blinking a lot
when you're bothered by something.

48
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,880
Like that.

49
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,410
I loved that.

50
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:59,180
And I love how you treat
everyone equally kindly.

51
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,660
For the past three years...

52
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm sure a lot of girls
fell in love with you,

53
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,060
but I think I definitely
liked you the most.

54
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,830
I'm certain...

55
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,040
...that I loved you...

56
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,810
...more than anyone else in the world.

57
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,730
I can't see very well...

58
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,850
But...

59
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,510
I've said everything...

60
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,010
It weighed on me like
I was carrying lead.

61
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,140
It was always so painful.

62
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,950
That's why...

63
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,840
I definitely don't regret this.

64
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,780
I feel refreshed.

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,270
Tsubaki.

66
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,150
I...

67
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,410
I can't return...

68
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,830
...your feelings.

69
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,890
Yeah...

70
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,430
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,680
I...

72
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,180
What's that...

73
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,640
...on your hand?

74
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,650
Huh? Oh, this is...

75
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:36,710
She drew my
game character
with an oil-based
 marker

76
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,930
She drew my
game character
with an oil-based
 marker
A friend of mine was fooling around...

77
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,280
She drew my
game character
with an oil-based
 marker

78
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,360
I know the person who drew that.

79
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,560
She's...

80
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,430
...the person you like...

81
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,330
...isn't she?

82
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:04,930
Yes.

83
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,210
Thank you for liking me.

84
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,350
I'm sorry...
I couldn't return your feelings.

85
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:25,230
It's okay.
I'm glad you listened.

86
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,020
I'm glad I could say it.

87
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,980
I knew.

88
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,120
Because I've always been watching you.

89
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,090
When you change...

90
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,720
...little by little.

91
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,300
I could tell right away,

92
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,660
even if no one noticed.

93
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,670
I feel refreshed after saying everything.

94
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,400
Thank you for your time.

95
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,570
I'll go home now.

96
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,290
Well, see you at school.

97
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:13,410
U-Um... Should I walk you home?

98
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:15,710
You don't have your glasses,
and it's already dark.

99
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,410
It's fine.
I can go home alone.

100
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:18,710
But...

101
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,060
It's all right.
I'm not that weak.

102
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,250
Okay.

103
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,830
Thank you...

104
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm glad you were so kind
to me until the end.

105
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,860
That was exactly
what I loved about you.

106
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,590
I loved you.

107
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,340
The college is about to go on break,
but I'm not sure about my part-time job.

108
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,490
Oh, is it too loud?

109
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,720
Sorry, I'm just getting ready to go out.

110
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,140
It's the guild's meeting.

111
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,220
No, it's not a club.

112
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:10,770
To the members of Chocolate Rabbit. Thanks to our sponsor Mr. Kamota,
\hthis December we'll be having a guild meeting at a yakiniku restaurant.
Rurihime

113
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,500
To the members of Chocolate Rabbit. Thanks to our sponsor Mr. Kamota,
\hthis December we'll be having a guild meeting at a yakiniku restaurant.
Rurihime
I told you about this before,

114
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,130
To the members of Chocolate Rabbit. Thanks to our sponsor Mr. Kamota,
\hthis December we'll be having a guild meeting at a yakiniku restaurant.
Rurihime
they're my friends from the game.

115
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,350
To the members of Chocolate Rabbit. Thanks to our sponsor Mr. Kamota,
\hthis December we'll be having a guild meeting at a yakiniku restaurant.
Rurihime
That's right,

116
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,640
To the members of Chocolate Rabbit. Thanks to our sponsor Mr. Kamota,
\hthis December we'll be having a guild meeting at a yakiniku restaurant.
Rurihime
I'm going out to have dinner with them.

117
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,030
I'm going out to have dinner with them.

118
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,000
Ah, she's here.

119
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,010
Right there.

120
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,860
You're right! Akane!

121
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,360
You're right! Akane!
Hi, Runa!

122
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,090
- Mr. Kamota, it's been a while.

123
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,210
- What meat do you want to eat?
- Mr. Kamota, it's been a while.

124
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:33,750
- What meat do you want to eat?
- Thank you for coming.

125
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,250
- Kalbi?! Is it kalbi?!
- Thank you for coming.

126
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,250
- Kalbi?! Is it kalbi?!
- Thank you for inviting me, too!

127
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,870
- What meat?!
- Thank you for inviting me, too!

128
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,750
- Is it kalbi?
- Thank you for inviting me, too!

129
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,450
I'd love to eat kalbi.

130
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,500
Runa wants kalbi too!

131
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,799
Huh? Yamada's not here.

132
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,000
Akito would come in late.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,630
Akito would come in late.
He's got school
 stuff to do.

134
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,880
Akito would come in late.
He's got school
 stuff to do.

135
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,230
'Sup!

136
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,920
You surprised me. Heya.

137
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,260
Shall I arrange for the two of you
to be alone together?

138
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,890
He's pretty busy, so you don't get a lot
of chances to see him often.

139
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:55,930
He's pretty busy, so you don't get a lot
of chances to see him often.
What?
A Scene from the Other Day

140
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:56,430
What?
A Scene from the Other Day

141
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,890
What?
A Scene from the Other Day
Well, I couldn't confess my feelings
to him the other day.

142
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,400
It's fine. I came here today
just to eat meat.

143
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,110
- Welcome!

144
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,400
- Is that so?
- Welcome!

145
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:05,900
I made a reservation under the name Kamota.

146
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,510
I made a reservation under the name Kamota.
Is Mr. Kamota really
treating us today?

147
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,400
Is Mr. Kamota really
treating us today?
We have been waiting for you, Mr. Kamota.

148
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,900
Is Mr. Kamota really
treating us today?
We have been waiting for you, Mr. Kamota.
He is

149
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,330
Besides, Yamada seems kind of tired lately.

150
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,330
Maybe it's the stress of the exams.

151
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,040
I doubt it.

152
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,580
He's taking the exams
like he has nothing to worry about.

153
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,790
Really?!

154
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:28,790
Then I guess it was just my imagination.

155
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:28,800
This restaurant looks so expensive!

156
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,670
This restaurant looks so expensive!
Isn't the inside of this
 restaurant kind of dimly lit?

157
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,250
Do you think the meat is expensive?!

158
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,260
Runa, keep your voice down, okay?

159
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,010
Why?!
I love meat
I love meat

160
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,390
It's a restaurant run by a friend of mine.

161
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,770
It just opened last month.

162
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,220
He kept calling me to come visit,

163
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,070
and I wanted to come here
with everyone in the guild.

164
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,400
Is that so?

165
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,030
You have so many connections, Mr. Kamota.

166
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,930
Ah! President Kamota!

167
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:54,910
It's been a while!

168
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,920
Inoue! You look very well!

169
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,990
I am! You're looking well, too,
Mr. President!

170
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,830
How is your business going?

171
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,580
Thanks to you, we're managing it somehow.

172
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:07,470
Ah, President Kamota!
You came to visit?

173
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,550
This is Mr. Oobayashi.
Good evening.

174
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,630
President Kamota, what a coincidence!

175
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,050
Good to see you, Chairman Nagaoka.

176
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,060
Oh my, Mr. Kamota!
What a surprise!

177
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,810
President Sumiyoshi's wife,
good to see you.

178
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,310
What a coincidence to meet you all here!

179
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,110
Wait, wait... He has too many connections!

180
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,760
Who are you, Mr. Kamota?

181
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,820
Hey!

182
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,190
We're eating in a private room!

183
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:37,950
This meat is so delicious!

184
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:37,960
This meat is so delicious!
It's melting
 in my mouth

185
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,060
This meat is so delicious!
It's melting
 in my mouth
Tied Her Hair Up
 for Serious Eating

186
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,460
It's melting
 in my mouth
Tied Her Hair Up
 for Serious Eating
It tastes even better
when you eat it with a lot of people.

187
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,450
It's too bad the newcomer couldn't come.

188
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,400
I invited them,
but they couldn't make it.

189
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,370
They don't have to come here!

190
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,050
Please excuse us.

191
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,350
This is from Mr. Inoue
in the room across from yours.

192
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,350
This is from Mr. Oobayashi.

193
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,350
This is from Mr. Nagaoka.

194
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,110
This is from Mrs. Sumiyoshi.

195
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,190
I'm sorry
about that

196
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,610
I'm sorry
about that
Oh my, they went out of their way.

197
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,610
Wow
He's so popular!
There's sake too! Wow!

198
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:15,950
I've never seen guests buy things...

199
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,330
I've never seen guests buy things...
This sake looks expensive...

200
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,860
This sake looks expensive...
...for another table before.

201
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,670
This sake looks expensive...
How nice! I want to be an adult...

202
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,950
This sake looks expensive...
...like Mr. Kamota, too!

203
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,370
This sake looks expensive...
...like Mr. Kamota, too!
So cool

204
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:24,890
Here, meat
 for you

205
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,590
Here, meat
 for you
What are you talking about?

206
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,750
Here, meat
 for you
You're already a splendid adult.

207
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,670
The only reason I'm able to hunt
in the dungeon so carefree

208
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,610
is because you're managing
the guild so well, Eita.

209
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:38,280
I give mine

210
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,950
I give mine
That's all because you're supporting me...

211
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,350
I give mine
...behind the scenes, Mr. Kamota.

212
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,720
Meat is yummy
That's not true.

213
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,350
Meat is yummy
Eita, you created a fun place to be,

214
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:47,530
Eita, you created a fun place to be,

215
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:50,440
where I was able to
meet some good friends,

216
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,650
so I'm really having fun every day!

217
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,800
I hope we can all keep
playing together for a long time.

218
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,010
I feel you!

219
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:04,030
I also want to keep playing
just like always with the current members!

220
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,330
The current members!

221
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,460
Just like... always...

222
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,290
But, well, change is necessary.

223
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:12,600
But, well, change is necessary.
It's done grilling

224
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,180
It's done grilling
A new wind is bound to blow in.

225
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,680
It's done grilling
Huh?! I'm against it!
Why can't we just stay like now?!

226
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,680
Don't fear change, Runa!

227
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,060
That's the meat I just grilled!

228
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,580
You think so?

229
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,730
But I'm the one who raised Runa,

230
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:28,720
so I practically grilled this kalbi myself!

231
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,190
You're so annoying, Eita!

232
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,950
Welcome!

233
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:38,950
You must be Mr. Kamota's companion.

234
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,790
You must be Mr. Kamota's companion.
Wow, so handsome

235
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,450
Wow, so handsome
Please follow me.

236
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
Ah! The caretaker has arrived!

237
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,070
You're late, Akkun!
Caretaker...?

238
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:48,850
Caretaker...?
Hi.

239
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,580
Caretaker...?
- We've been waiting for you, Akito!

240
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:49,990
- We've been waiting for you, Akito!

241
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,540
- Yamada, listen to me!
- We've been waiting for you, Akito!

242
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:54,170
I'm in a trouble right now!

243
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,890
- I told you to come earlier, didn't I?
- It's really a big trouble!

244
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:57,430
- No... Um...
- It's really a big trouble!

245
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,730
- No... Um...
- Runa in a trouble right now!

246
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,370
- Here! There's a lot of different meats!
- Runa in a trouble right now!

247
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:01,620
- Here! There's a lot of different meats!
- Listen to me, Yamada! Runa right now...!

248
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,430
- Please speak one at a time...
- Listen to me, Yamada! Runa right now...!

249
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,570
Oh, crap. She's back!

250
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,440
It's Yamada!

251
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:17,940
Wha...

252
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:23,530
Why is she so drunk?

253
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:23,800
I'm sorry

254
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm sorry
That's because I asked her to try...

255
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,380
I'm sorry
...the sake that was gifted to us.

256
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,040
I'm sorry
It's not your fault, Mr. Kamota!

257
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,220
It's Akane's fault
for chugging it down like that!

258
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:33,910
Runa, you should really
stop acting so cliquey

259
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,500
Runa, you should really
stop acting so cliquey
She kept clinging to me in that tension,

260
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,690
Runa, you should really
stop acting so cliquey
She kept clinging to me in that tension,
I can't take it
anymore

261
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,010
Runa, you should really
stop acting so cliquey
I can't take it
anymore
and it's so annoying.

262
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:41,800
Runa, you should really
stop acting so cliquey
I can't take it
anymore
Akane sure is a cheerful drunk.

263
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:41,860
Runa, you should really
stop acting so cliquey
Akane sure is a cheerful drunk.

264
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,930
Runa, you should really
stop acting so cliquey

265
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,050
Yamada, I'll leave the rest to you.

266
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,190
If she gets too annoying,

267
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,520
you can just leave her in the bathroom.
That's what I did.

268
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,560
No, that'll be a problem.

269
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,050
Akito, sit down and eat with us.

270
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,940
I'll call a taxi for Akane later, it's fine.

271
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,450
You don't need to do that.
Akito will take Akanecchi home.

272
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,580
Is that so?

273
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,520
Yes!

274
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,770
Well, they do seem very close.

275
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,510
Then I guess I should
just leave it to him.

276
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,420
Jeez...

277
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,710
You're late, Yamara...

278
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,170
Sorry about that.

279
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,050
Delicious!

280
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:27,470
Wouldn't it be better
to pick up girls around there?

281
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,310
Yeah.

282
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,450
Are there any cute girls?

283
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,940
Huh?!

284
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,570
Water for you.

285
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,010
Huh? Oh no!
Did I just sleep here?!

286
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,440
Yes.

287
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,220
I can't believe it!

288
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,200
Neither can I.

289
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,910
Wow! It's water!

290
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,790
I was just feeling really thirsty!
How did you know I wanted water?

291
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,160
You were making a big fuss
about it in a song.

292
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,050
Huh?

293
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,810
My throat is so parched~

294
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:01,960
Are we in a desert or what~

295
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:02,650
I'm sorry to make you
go along with me everytime

296
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,790
I'm sorry to make you
go along with me everytime
I'm so sorry for troubling you!
I'll do my best not to forget this favour!

297
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,220
I'm sorry to make you
go along with me everytime
I can't remember much
when I was drunk!

298
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:13,230
I know, I'll write a memo!
If it's in my phone, it'll be okay!

299
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,490
I know, I'll write a memo!
If it's in my phone, it'll be okay!
Can you please
 lower your voice
 a little bit?

300
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:14,530
Can you please
 lower your voice
 a little bit?
It's okay if you forget.

301
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,550
Can you please
 lower your voice
 a little bit?
Let's just head home.

302
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,730
Can you please
 lower your voice
 a little bit?
It's already late.

303
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,770
Ah, he's right.
It's already this late...

304
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:22,280
Yamada, you can just leave me here.

305
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,330
You'll have to walk again if you—

306
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,030
It's dangerous.
I'll walk you home.

307
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,410
There are a lot of drunkards around here.

308
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,530
Besides just you.

309
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,130
Sorry, my heel got stuck in the groove.

310
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:54,570
Huh?

311
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,890
Oh no, I can't get it out.

312
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,360
Um...

313
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,690
I'm really sorry.
I'm being such a burden...

314
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:10,620
It's really stuck in the ground.

315
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:21,250
I got i—

316
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,400
Shall we go?

317
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,070
Okay.

318
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:14,300
Then, I'll be going now.

319
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:16,050
Goodnight.

320
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,310
Thank you.

321
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,329
Be careful on your way home.

322
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,190
Hey...

323
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,630
U-Um...

324
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,820
Y-Yamada... D-Do you like me?

325
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,040
Huh?

326
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,040
Um... That's...

327
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,400
Huh? I just kinda got that feeling...

328
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,470
After all...

329
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,550
Our hands...

330
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,620
You caught me.

331
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,750
When you held my hand...

332
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,440
U-Um...

333
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,010
...I felt like you were telling me that.

334
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,740
I'm drunk right now.

335
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,450
Um, can we talk about this properly?

336
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,080
About what I meant by that...

337
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,240
I like you.

338
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,960
I...

339
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,880
...have feelings for you.

340
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:27,070
It's fine if you wake up
tomorrow morning and forget it.

341
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,290
I'll just come and tell you again,

342
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,170
until you remember it.

343
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,280
Good night.

344
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,310
Tomorrow...

345
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,410
Are you Yamada with the Afro?

346
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,360
Are you Yamada with the Afro?
Can I call you...

347
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,010
Who are you?

348
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,040
Who are you?
...when I wake up...

349
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:53,610
Who are you?

350
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,650
...tomorrow morning?

351
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,420
Well, love isn't always easy

352
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,870
Well, love isn't always easy
I'll definitely think it was a dream,

353
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,670
I'll definitely think it was a dream,

354
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,060
and I'll be worried.

355
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,380
That's Tragic

356
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,560
Would that be...

357
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,670
...all right?

358
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,050
I'll do it.

359
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:30,520
Tomorrow...

360
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,050
...as soon...

361
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,910
...as I wake up.

362
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,120
When I Wake Up in the  Morning

363
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,760
Stop
Alarm
Snooze

364
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,680
Incoming Call
Akito Yamada

365
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,770
Yes?

366
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,810
Good morning.

367
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,190
Good morning!

368
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,210
She hasn't slept a wink

369
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:37,520
She hasn't slept a wink
And so, what did you talk
about on the phone?

370
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,170
And so, what did you talk
about on the phone?

371
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,170
Tell me everything, word for word!

372
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,030
That's a secret!

373
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,450
Oh, so you got a boyfriend?
Good for you!

374
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,090
- What is your boyfriend like?

375
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,520
- Doesn't this mean I'm the only one...
- What is your boyfriend like?

376
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,270
- Doesn't this mean I'm the only one...
- Is he in our school?

377
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,040
...in the group who doesn't have a boyfriend?

378
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,390
Even i did all my best until this day...

379
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,370
Even i did all my best until this day...
Wow, he's younger than you.

380
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,420
Even i did all my best until this day...
Yeah.

381
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,850
I'm not good with younger guys.

382
00:21:58,850 --> 00:21:59,970
Really?

383
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,300
I felt he was expecting a mature woman,

384
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,020
I felt he was expecting a mature woman,
Thought it was
my fault

385
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,430
Thought it was
my fault
so it became hard for me to open up.

386
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:05,910
A Mature
Woman?

387
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:08,990
A Mature
Woman?
In the end, he said,
"I don't understand what you're thinking".

388
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,180
A Mature
Woman?
And then I thought dating
younger guys is hard.

389
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:12,530
Why am i
still single...

390
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,290
Why am i
still single...
Well, I think you'll be fine, Akane.

391
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,280
Why am i
still single...
That sounded like it was
totally someone else's problem...

392
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,230
Why am i
still single...
Well, it is.

393
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,810
Well, it is.

394
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,190
It's shameless
Mature Woman

395
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,550
It's shameless
Mature Woman
Can you stop acting all depressed
in front of me when I'm the one who's single?

396
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,120
It's shameless
Mature Woman

397
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,690
It's shameless
Mature Woman
I'm sorry.

398
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,340
I'm sorry.

399
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,070
Well, it's fine.

400
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,720
Well, it's fine.
It's fun being
single anyway

401
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,200
It's fun being
single anyway
I figured you two would
get together sooner or later.

402
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,410
Really?

403
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,290
Yeah, it smelled that way.

404
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,080
Smel—

405
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,580
Was it really that obvious
that I had a thing for Yamada?

406
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:39,860
Was it really that obvious
that I had a thing for Yamada?
I can't tell
on my own

407
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,490
I can't tell
on my own

408
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:41,710
I can't tell
on my own
Nope.

409
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,350
It was the reverse.

410
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:51,790
So! Basically,
what I want to say is...

411
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,970
You'll be taking the exam soon, right?

412
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,150
I really don't think you have much time,

413
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,730
so you don't have to worry about me.

414
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,690
Mature Woman

415
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:02,610
Mature Woman
And I'll do my best
not to be a burden to you.

416
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,670
But sometimes,
when you're feeling tired,

417
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:08,900
you can depend on me.

418
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,370
Can you at least pretend to listen?

419
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,690
No, I was listening.

420
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:15,830
I heard to the part about how people
have to support each other.

421
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,910
That's a great beginning.

422
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,630
After that, I didn't really understand
what you were trying to say.

423
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,810
When I was watching you
opening and closing your mouth,

424
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:29,260
I noticed that your canine teeth
were quite sharp.

425
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,010
Huh?!

426
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,470
I thought that was pretty cute.

427
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,220
Cu—

428
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,980
Cough, cough!

429
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,120
You're teasing me, aren't you?!

430
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,230
No, not at all.

431
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,480
Mature Woman

432
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,550
Let's stop here

433
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,180
Let's stop here
So being a mature woman
didn't work out at all.

434
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,980
Let's stop here

435
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,620
I'll walk you home.

436
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,490
Thanks.

437
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,800
In the end...

438
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,400
Yes?!

439
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,650
What were you trying
to say back there?

440
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,120
He's Thinking About It the Whole Time

441
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,630
Um...

442
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,130
I mean...

443
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,430
When we walk together,

444
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,100
I want to hold hands.

445
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,270
Aah...

446
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,240
Sorry about that.

447
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,730
Wasn't your explanation
a little too confusing?

448
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,110
I'll improve it.

449
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,890
Please do.

450
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,710
Is this a shoe?

451
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,000
Yeah, it's probably a shoe.

452
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,670
Does it function as a shoe?

453
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:50,510
No... If it doesn't function,
it'll be like that.

454
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,360
Why don't you wear proper shoes...

455
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,370
...rather than slumping to the ground?

456
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,370
I really don't understand women at all.

457
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,880
Are you okay?
