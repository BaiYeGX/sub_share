1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:02,730
Can you hear me, Akane?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,160
Let me carry you.

3
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,970
He picking it up?

4
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,360
Surely I'll Hurt Myself  Someday

5
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,400
Surely I'll Hurt Myself  Someday
No.

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,220
Surely I'll Hurt Myself  Someday

7
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,770
Maybe his tutoring job got extended.

8
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,140
Still, it's so rare of him
to not holler at us at all.

9
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,530
Maybe he's playing with a girl?

10
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,639
The phone call the other day
was kind of sus too...

11
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,290
Yamada's not that kind of person.

12
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,910
You don't get it, do you, Class Rep?

13
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,740
Slack off all you want,

14
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,950
and he'll be taken away
by another girl out of nowhere.

15
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,760
I know.

16
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,850
I know it.

17
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,470
Stop trying to scare me.

18
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,400
If you're so worked up about it,
just come clean to him already.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,250
What's holding you up, geez?

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,270
I'll meet someone someday.

21
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,940
I think so.

22
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,110
Yamada, do you know GOS:E?

23
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,450
It's an FPS game.
You're playing it too, right?

24
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,580
Do you remember your match
against me last night around 22:00?

25
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,110
I'm Yukari Tsubaki from Class D.

26
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,490
I go by YT03 in-game,
and I had a match against you...

27
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,160
I traced your SNS from
 your game account

28
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,840
I traced your SNS from
 your game account
So if you like,

29
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,120
I don't really remember
I'd like to see your gameplay in person.

30
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,350
I don't really remember

31
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,850
But why?

32
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,030
I have a few thoughts on this.

33
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,480
She thinks you're cheating.

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,710
Please go home once
you've seen me play.

35
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,580
Of course.

36
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,450
Tsubaki, you should see
my fabulous gameplay too later.

37
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,350
I actually suspected you a bit.

38
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,730
I'd wondered if such gameplay
could be done by grinding alone.

39
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,380
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,279
I was so ignorant.

41
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,279
So there are amazing people in this world.

42
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,990
You should become a pro.

43
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,750
Just like when I first met him...

44
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,930
Someday, he will also...

45
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,120
...meet someone else.

46
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,390
For all his eye-catching looks,

47
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,530
he's rather quiet and reserved,

48
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,570
and for all his bluntness,

49
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,560
he's quite kind.

50
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:14,800
Anyone familiar with him will know.

51
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,930
Also...

52
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,170
Yamada, we were
in the same committee last week...

53
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,730
And you've helped me a lot...

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,180
So...

55
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,680
Huh? Have we ever talked before?

56
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,100
He can even be cruel at times...

57
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,690
Hey, have you heard?

58
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:38,310
Shiraishi from Class D has finally
confessed to Yamada, apparently!

59
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,240
For real?!

60
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,230
And she really died an honourable death.

61
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,640
If Shiraishi's out of the picture,
then who isn't?

62
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,180
Maybe girls won't even do?

63
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,830
Really?

If you're always alone
when you're so popular,

72

73
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,560
people will spread bad rumours.

Weary...

75
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,760
Weary...
I couldn't care less about them, could I?

76
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,470
I couldn't care less about them, could I?

77
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,100
Well, yeah, but you look so pitiful with people
talking behind your back all they want.

78
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,370
Don't you have a type of girl?

79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,110
No.

80
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,500
You should have at least one, right?

81
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,490
None.

82
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,070
Huh? Then what about your first love?

83
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,190
Really...

84
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,950
I don't have any.

85
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,150
He's sighing...

86
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,300
Sorry...

87
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,210
No, my bad.
I was too persistent.

88
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,310
Silence...

89
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,630
Silence...
Regret...

90
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:39,710
Silence...

91
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,210
Err...

92
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,550
So...

93
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,520
Uh...

94
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,840
Gloomy
By the way...

95
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:47,970
Gloomy
Huh?

96
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,470
Huh?

97
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:52,640
There was once a girl who liked me...

98
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:56,100
But she ended up getting bullied a lot...

99
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,480
What?

100
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,230
What?
Bullied?!

101
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,050
She was almost never present at school.

102
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,820
Since her house was close to mine,

103
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,330
my homeroom teacher used to
have me deliver things to her.

104
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,490
Eventually, we got along well.

105
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,560
But, even during the rare
occasion of her going to school,

106
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,730
she didn't seem to
have a place without me.

107
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,210
So I tried to be by her side
whenever I could.

108
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,510
So...

109
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,450
You started to like that girl?

110
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,400
Akito.

111
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,630
Even if we become adults,
let's stay together.

112
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,520
We can't know for sure.

113
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,630
I was just asked by
my teacher, so I did all that.

114
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,480
In the end, she couldn't handle the bullying,
so she moved to another school.

115
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,460
But sometimes, I'd remember her...

116
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,110
I made her cry so much
when we met for the last time.

117
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,680
I'd also sometimes think what
should've been the right answer.

118
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,340
But I just can't understand...

119
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,430
It's just...

120
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,840
It feels like a bother now.

121
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,000
Ever since, I grew up
to be not fond of girls.

122
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:40,059
I see... So he's not so interested in himself.

123
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,870
That's why he can't see
through those who like him.

124
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,270
That, or he deliberately tries not to.

125
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,690
It's a bother, he said...

126
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,030
Scary...

127
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,980
I need to make sure not to fall for him.

128
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,110
I need to make sure not to fall for him.

00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,570
So you can stand now?

181
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,530
How are you feeling?

182
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,080
I am feeling surprised.

183
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,780
I'm not asking about that feeling.

184
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,780
So this isn't a dream?!
Why are you here?!

185
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,570
She Got an Extreme Headache and Dizziness from Shouting
Throb Throb
Oww...

186
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,190
She Got an Extreme Headache and Dizziness from Shouting
Throb Throb
I'll explain everything,

187
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,030
She Got an Extreme Headache and Dizziness from Shouting
Throb Throb
so you better go to bed.

188
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,510
You couldn't drink water,
so you were really in danger.

189
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,090
Yes...

190
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,340
So, how are you feeling?

191
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,120
Come to think of it,
when I woke up...

192
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,550
I thought I was feeling a bit better.

193
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,340
I thought I was feeling a bit better.
Why, I wonder?

194
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,100
Why, I wonder?

195
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,820
That's great, then.

196
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,710
I went to check up on you,
but you collapsed at the bicycle parking lot.

197
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,480
I did?!

198
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:13,810
- I think I might've seen an image

199
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,430
- So I brought you here just to be safe.
- I think I might've seen an image

200
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,740
of Yamada for a moment there...

201
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,450
So it was really Yamada who saved me?

202
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,350
You seemed so tired back there.

203
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,830
He was so worried of me,
so he checked up on me...

204
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,820
He might catch my cold,

205
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,330
but he was always by my side?

206
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,900
but he was always by my side?
Sob...

207
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,880
Sob...

208
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,810
- Why is he so kind to me?

209
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,350
- I looked for a hospital
- Why is he so kind to me?

210
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,560
- that accepts patients at nighttime,

211
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,330
- so I took you there...
- All for my sake...

212
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:51,550
I'm so happy...
Thank you, Yamada.

213
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,650
I couldn't walk on my own...

214
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,400
You're my lifesaver!

215
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,400
I really owe your a big time!

216
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:01,770
The High Spirit from High Fever

217
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:01,990
The High Spirit from High Fever
You're an angel!

218
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:02,810
The High Spirit from High Fever
You're an angel!
Thank you for being
 born to this world

219
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,320
The High Spirit from High Fever
Thank you for being
 born to this world
Y-Yes...

220
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,770
The High Spirit from High Fever
Thank you for being
 born to this world
Y-Yes...
Scary...

221
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,160
The High Spirit from High Fever
Thank you for being
 born to this world
Scary...
So, back to what I said...

222
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,870
So, back to what I said...

223
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:12,040
I'm sorry for saying that you're so cold,
even though you're so kind!

224
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,460
Did you say that to me?

225
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:13,780
Did you say that to me?
I'll look after you
if you catch my cold

226
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,410
I'll look after you
if you catch my cold
You've always been so kind

227
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,830
I'll look after you
if you catch my cold
to me from the start!

228
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,920
I'll look after you
if you catch my cold
You'll fall down if you keep moving.

229
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,550
You'll fall down if you keep moving.

230
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,730
Oh, sorry. I stepped on it.

231
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,050
Huh? That book...

232
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,350
To the Heartbroken You

233
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,810
To the Heartbroken You
I got time to spare, so I borrowed
it myself and tried reading it.

234
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,320
It's a nice book, isn't it?
This book was my true salvation!

235
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,690
I didn't really get it.

236
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,250
I didn't really get it.
I fell asleep reading it

237
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,730
I fell asleep reading it
This book doesn't concern you, Yamada.

238
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,280
I fell asleep reading it
If I had to say, you'd be the one
on the rejecting side most of the time.

239
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,950
If I had to say, you'd be the one
on the rejecting side most of the time.

240
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,430
To the New Me
The Medicine
For Heartbreak
To the
Heartbroken You

241
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,740
To the New Me
The Medicine
For Heartbreak
To the
Heartbroken You
No, that's not...

242
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,200
To the New Me
The Medicine
For Heartbreak
To the
Heartbroken You
There you go again!

243
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,950
Your hype's scaring me.
Due to High Fever

244
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,750
Your hype's scaring me.

245
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Ow, ow, ow...

246
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:50,950
Ow, ow, ow...
I went overboard

247
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,140
Ow, ow, ow...
I went overboard
and hurt my head...

248
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,830
I went overboard
and hurt my head...
Well, the rejecting side

249
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,710
I went overboard
and hurt my head...
has their own problems, though.

250
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,450
has their own problems, though.

251
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:59,960
Especially when you're so kind,
so it must be tiring.

252
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,370
I'm...

253
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,710
...not really...

254
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,000
...that kind.

255
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,730
Takuma also had
the same look on his face.

256
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,630
You'd feel sorry and tired...

257
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,890
...and want to disappear
with that look on your face.

258
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,370
It's fine. I mean, it's romance,
after all. It is what it is.

259
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,400
Even though he cheated on you?

260
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,500
Well, looking back now...

261
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,880
I think it was for the best
to have him dump me with no lies.

262
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,850
Sorry, Akane.

263
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,060
I could really settle it
with no sad memories.

264
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,090
Sorry...

265
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,760
Sorry...

266
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,490
I knew it was pointless of me
to say anything,

267
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,670
so I quickly accepted
the talk to break up.

268
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,300
Got it.

269
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,150
When it all becomes a memory,
and I reminisce about it,

270
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,890
he sure wants me to remember
the smiling me than the crying me.

271
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,710
I sure had a nice girl...

272
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,960
I've surely done something I regret...

273
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,290
Won't that be better?

274
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,610
So...

275
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,430
...you took pity on me?

276
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,110
Goodbye, Akito.

277
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:46,320
Sorry! Also, thank you
for always being with me!

278
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,810
Goodbye!

279
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,300
Right...

280
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,730
Yamada

281
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,550
Has it gone down?

282
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,860
I think it has...

283
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:30,080
I think it has...
I don't know the
peak time, though...

284
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,860
I don't know the
peak time, though...

285
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,070
I don't know the
peak time, though...
Can I eat the yogurt you bought?

286
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,230
Can I eat the yogurt you bought?

287
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:35,240
Sure.

288
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,740
Munch Munch...
Sob Sob... Sniff...

289
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,450
Munch Munch...
Sob Sob... Sniff...
It is so good, you'd cry?

290
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,780
Munch Munch...
Sob Sob... Sniff...
It's so painful to swallow it...

291
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,630
Munch Munch...
Sob Sob... Sniff...
Oh...

292
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,530
If it wasn't Yamada that's here,

293
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,010
I'd be so panicked, I bet...

294
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:54,390
I'd be so panicked, I bet...
I'm so drowsy...

295
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,850
I can see the
 wings of an angel...

296
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,130
I can see the
 wings of an angel...
What's with this feeling

297
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,780
I can see the
 wings of an angel...
of ease and security...

298
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,630
I can see the
 wings of an angel...
...that Yamada lets out?

299
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,730
I can see the
 wings of an angel...

300
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,080
Well, it must've been disastrous to him.

301
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,840
He's already not fond of girls too.

302
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,320
Thanks for the food.

303
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,000
Could I leave it with you?

304
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,360
Sure.

305
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,200
Ah...

306
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,560
Oh, shoot...

307
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,160
My leg...

308
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,130
I think I got a leg cramp... Ow!

309
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,460
- Ow... Owww!
- You should stretch...

310
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,260
...your leg.

311
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,260
In super agony

312
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,010
Gosh... Akane.

313
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,400
Lend me your legs.

314
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,410
It hurts!

315
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,250
No way! It hurts like hell!

316
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,650
Don't touch me!

317
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,150
Calm down.

318
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,030
Endure it.

319
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:57,060
Endure it.
Shove

320
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,870
Shove
Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow...

321
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,370
Ow, ow, ow! Ow, ow...

322
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,760
It doesn't hurt anymore.

323
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,190
Right?

324
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,580
I thought I was going to die...

325
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,060
You're exaggerating...

326
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,160
That really hurt, you know?

327
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,900
Huh?

328
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:33,230
He's really staring at me... I think.

329
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:38,960
Wait, why do I feel at ease...

330
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,910
...with him, again?

331
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,790
He Picked Up the Dropped Spoon

332
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,550
She Hit Her Head
Throb Throb

333
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,420
What? Wasn't trying
to dodge you, you know?

334
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,530
Hey, why are you laughing?!

335
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,370
No reason.

336
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,940
Why are you laughing!
Whatever it is, it's not what you think!

337
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,990
It's really not!

338
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,740
I'll be on my way, then.

339
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,090
You're going to school
without any sleep?

340
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,470
Yes. I'm used to it.

341
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,480
Sorry about this.

342
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,050
If you feel sick,
let me know.

343
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:55,620
She Heard the Explanation After Her
Consciousness Has Returned

344
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,300
She Heard the Explanation After Her
Consciousness Has Returned
Also, thanks for the hospital, too.

345
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,480
She Heard the Explanation After Her
Consciousness Has Returned
Also, thanks for the hospital, too.
Maybe attending on
 or reimbursing you

346
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:58,940
She Heard the Explanation After Her
Consciousness Has Returned
Maybe attending on
 or reimbursing you

347
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,920
She Heard the Explanation After Her
Consciousness Has Returned
Maybe attending on
 or reimbursing you
I'll be sure to return
the favour next time.

348
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,430
It's not a big deal.

349
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,440
Don't mind me.

350
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,010
After a day,

351
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,520
they told me that you should
come back there again,

352
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,950
for a daytime examination.

353
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,310
I'm okay...

354
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:15,770
I'm okay...
It's endo clinic, right?

355
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,690
It's endo clinic, right?

356
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,690
They really couldn't do
any detailed examinations at night.

357
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,600
But you've got better
with the IV injection,

358
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,200
so it's just in case.

359
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,580
Excuse me, then.

360
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,670
Sorry.

361
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,030
I didn't know you were
that close to me.

362
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:40,260
Sorry. I was being too close...

363
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,430
It was as if...

364
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,820
...my body was gravitating
toward him on its own...

365
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,420
Akane, I need to go now...

366
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,570
S-S-S-Sorry! It's nothing, so just go!

367
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,430
You okay?

368
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:03,610
I'm okay, so just go!

369
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,950
I'm okay, so just go!
You feel lonely?

370
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:08,560
Oh, right! Maybe I should tell you the results
when I come back from the hospital?!

371
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,540
I think it's just a common cold, though!

372
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,780
Oh, sorry! You don't need that, do you?!

373
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,000
M-M-Maybe you
actually caught some of my cold!

374
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:19,560
I'm just so curious,
so that's all there is to it!

375
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,680
Please do, then.

376
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,530
Sure!

377
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,260
Get well soon.
