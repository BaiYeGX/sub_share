1
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,840
Wow, the posters are lining up!

2
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:16,930
The opening intro's
looping over there too.

3
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,550
EXTREME LEBANILLA HEALING BOWL
The menu looks interesting, Eita.

4
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,390
OF THE EVIL DEMETAL
The menu looks interesting, Eita.

5
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,550
It's got the strong dungeon boss' name.

6
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,630
There's some nostalgic names too!

7
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,530
Wow, always so quick on the checking,
aren't you, Kamota?

8
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,850
Let me see!

9
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,860
That looks surprisingly good!

10
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,640
What are you guys having?

11
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,530
Oh, shoot...

12
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,350
I know Yamada and Rurihime,

13
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,280
- but who's this old-timer and glasses dude?
- It says Flame Salamander Curry.

14
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,830
That takes me back!

15
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,630
Eita, didn't you like spicy stuff?

16
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,400
I'm more into sweet stuff.

17
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,490
They're having a lot of fun over there...

18
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,520
Rurihime?

19
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,820
Who are those two?

20
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,350
They're our guild members, right?

21
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,450
Kamota and Eita.

22
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,100
Huh?

23
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,530
Like I'm saying...
Could you fill me in on that?

24
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,729
Anyway, my nickname
in-game isn't Rurihime.

25
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,740
What?

26
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:14,340
I could ask the same
about who you are right now.

27
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,000
MY LOVE STORY WITH YAMADA AT LV 999

28
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,700
What?

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
LV. 04 - DO YOU LIKE YAMADA?

30
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,750
LV. 04 - DO YOU LIKE YAMADA?
Um, who am I, you ask?

31
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,770
What's up with you,
barging into our guild's offline meeting?

32
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,930
Huh? You're Rurihime, aren't you?

33
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,500
I told you, I'm not.

34
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,390
But...

35
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,770
Never mind me, who ARE you?

36
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,450
Hang on a sec...
So where's Rurihime?

37
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,270
Rurihime...

38
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,710
I'm telling you...

39
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,850
Eita.

40
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,089
Before we order anything, shouldn't we
introduce ourselves to each other first?

41
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,050
THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS...
Oh, you got a point.

42
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,780
THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS...
Sorry, Akane.

43
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,040
Allow me to introduce myself.

44
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,550
Eita Sasaki, 19-years-old.
My hobby is MMO.

45
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,030
I'm the person behind Rurihime.

46
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,780
Nice to meet you.

47
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,140
Akane!

48
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,050
Ca...

49
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,820
WHAT IS "CATFISH"?
What is "Catfish"?

50
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,290
Using the anonymity of the Internet society,

51
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,740
where one can't be seen
and their identity is unknown,

52
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,880
it's when a man poses as a woman online.

53
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,960
This term is also used for the person
posing as a woman, or the action.

54
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,340
It's the short version
of "Internet catfish",

55
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,530
and is been used since the pre-Internet era
of personal computer communications.

56
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,900
Catfish...

57
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,380
Oh, but I'm not.

58
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:06,510
I'm but one of the cogs to move the muse
that has landed in the sea of electrons.

59
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,790
That means,
Rurihime and I are not, but not one!

60
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,660
I don't want people to call that special state
something cheap as "catfishing".

61
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,860
It's not that simple, mind you.

62
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:21,960
Rurihime and I in the 2D world
share the same destiny or something.

63
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,930
She's my goddess, my mother,
my waifu, and my clone, or something!

64
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,230
When a guy goes cross-gender in a game,

65
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,650
they always make a fuss,
but they just don't understand.

66
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,280
In that context, my relationship...

67
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,700
- Eita...
- ...with Rurihime is a creative one!

68
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,050
Most people just won't get it,

69
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,320
- Eita!
- but my point is...

70
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,330
SO HE'S A GUY...

71
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,740
SO HE'S A GUY...
You're the only one on great fire here...

72
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,490
SO HE'S A GUY...

73
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:46,340
I gave you my number and told you
my embarrassing stories, though?!

74
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,160
Calm down, Akane.

75
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,520
Don't worry.
It's not me, but Rurihime.

76
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,930
I don't get you!

77
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,250
Err...

78
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,410
I'm Takezo Kamota.

79
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,760
My avatar name is my name, in alphabet.

80
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,630
I'M A STRAWBERRY FARMER
My avatar name is my name, in alphabet.

81
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,430
I'M A STRAWBERRY FARMER
I mostly do AFK hunting at dungeons,

82
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,670
I mostly do AFK hunting at dungeons,

83
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,960
so I'm sure you've never met me in-game.

84
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,270
This girl is Runa.

85
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:13,520
She's Eita's sister,
and is the model for Rurihime.

86
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,450
Using his little sister
as a model sure creeps me out.

87
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,430
And he's Akito Yamada.

88
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,910
I'm sure you two
have known each other, right?

89
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,620
Huh?!

90
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,950
What do you mean you've
known each other?!

91
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,400
Why? How come you two
know each other?

92
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,210
Huh...

93
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,040
Uhh, that's...

94
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,590
STARE...
Uhh, that's...

95
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,540
STARE...

96
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,850
I can't put it simply.

97
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,890
It's a long story.

98
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,050
WHAT A DRAG...
But I can! We only met at an event!

99
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,820
That's putting it simply.

100
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,390
I've been aware of it for some time...

101
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,620
THIS GIRL IS AN EYESORE... GRRRRRR

102
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,040
THIS GIRL IS AN EYESORE... GRRRRRR
But she really hates me!

103
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,060
Oh, but...

104
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,190
I see now.

105
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,210
So it was you and Eita
that I saw in-game.

106
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,690
You guys seemed like flirting,
so I thought you might be a couple.

107
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,960
He's my senior here,
so whenever he's into it,

108
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,940
I have no choice but to match with him.

109
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,710
Yamada!

110
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,720
X FLIRTING
V SENIOR-JUNIOR RELATIONSHIP

111
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,330
His order as a senior.

112
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,970
I see... Must be tough for you.

113
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,980
You said you've never had
a girlfriend the other day,

114
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,110
but I thought it was a lie.

115
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,500
I won't lie about that.

116
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,200
I guess you won't.
That's a relief.

117
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,300
Huh?

118
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,630
What did I just...

119
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,670
A relief?

120
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,160
Did you just say "That's a relief"?

121
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,280
What do you imply with that, Ma'am?

122
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,130
Don't tell me...

123
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,520
Do you like Yamada?

124
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,520
N-No...

125
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,530
Sorry, Akane!

126
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,760
My little sister's so conscious
about her territory,

127
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,180
and she's in her rebellious age now.

128
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,610
SHE'S REALLY BEEN TROUBLE
and she's in her rebellious age now.

129
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,160
She can be so hard on a stranger.

130
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,809
You can't do that to
a girl older than you.

131
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,409
I'm totally fine.

132
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,110
You can't live in a society like that.

133
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,630
Stay out of this, you catfish.

134
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,130
I'm not a catfish!
It's my ambition!

135
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,790
Shut up.

136
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,130
Please don't fight...

137
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,070
Uhh, have you guys
decided on what to order?

138
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,600
What should I have now...

139
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,140
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO PICK
What should I have now...

140
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,820
That took me by surprise...

141
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,610
I guess we should call—

142
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,250
Akane! Are you okay?!

143
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,690
I'm sorry!
My hands just slipped...

144
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:23,430
Are you hurt?
I'll go call a waiter!

145
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,130
It's okay, I can do it...

146
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,790
It's dangerous, so we should
let the staff handle this.

147
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,340
R-Right...

148
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,500
Excuse me!
We've dropped a glass!

149
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,430
Oh, shoot...

150
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,800
That really surprised me...

151
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,540
What do I do?

152
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,800
My face must be
blushing red now, right?

153
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,450
Maybe I should run off to the toilet?

154
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,100
Won't it be unnatural if I do now?

155
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,460
But I need to calm down quick...

156
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,100
Excuse me, need to make a quick call.

157
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,870
'Kay.

158
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,720
What about your order?

159
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,280
I can order for you...

160
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,750
Just order for yourself first.

161
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,380
That saved my bacon...

162
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,590
Are you okay?

163
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,420
Y-Yeah...

164
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,230
Sorry, I'll be off picking
some flowers too.

165
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,030
YEAH...
Rurihime, huh...

166
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,410
She's still giving me the stare...

167
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,370
Take your time.

168
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,240
Thank you.

169
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,870
Have you calmed down?

170
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,360
Yes, sorry for the commotion.

171
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,890
Good thing you're not hurt.

172
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:47,330
Thank you.

173
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,880
Kamota's such a nice guy!

174
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,880
We heard you'd be joining us
for the first time in our offline meeting,

175
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,630
so all of us were looking forward to it.

176
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,890
I never heard of it,
nor looked forward to it.

177
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,680
Are you guys old acquaintances?

178
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,250
We four were together
in the same game before.

179
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,360
I started playing FOS
after Eita invited me.

180
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,560
Runa seldom logs in, though.

181
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,660
- Only once every three months.

182
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,310
- So it's a gathering of friends,
- Only once every three months.

183
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,800
- So it's a gathering of friends,
- MMO's a drag.

184
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,700
other than me.

185
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,810
Eita was so pumped up to introduce
a new charming member...

186
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,120
...to the circle today.

187
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,410
Hey, are you going after my broski?!

188
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,620
No, I'm not!

189
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,310
Didn't you say you never lied?

190
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,130
That call was a lie, right?

191
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,020
What's up?

192
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,320
Somehow...

193
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,530
I felt that I should
escape her vision there...

194
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,400
Don't come near me.

195
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,900
That's the aura I felt from her.

196
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,400
So you thought of her like that...

197
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,960
I think what Runa said
was so disturbing to her.

198
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,110
Maybe Akane was just embarrassed.

199
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,040
Why would she?

200
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,160
Oh, don't make me say it.

201
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,560
I won't know if you don't tell me.

202
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,760
You've always been like that, huh?

203
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,420
Not that it matters.

204
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,470
Anyway, Akane IRL's such a pretty lady, eh!

205
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,640
You look exactly as your avatar,
so I thought she'd be more childish too.

206
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,190
Yamada! Yamada!

207
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,650
Yamada!

208
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,030
She looks exactly like her avatar.

209
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,810
Huh?!

210
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,560
She doesn't look childish
at all like her avatar!

211
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,600
You think so?

212
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,120
Besides, the female avatar
in FOS looks like a young girl.

213
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,630
I can't tell what's so different about that.

214
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:45,020
You keep saying that,
that's why you don't have a girlfriend.

215
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,120
Isn't it about time you stopped
making fun of me being girlfriendless?

216
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,590
It was fun until before,
but now I'm seriously concerned.

217
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,320
Your indifference
toward a girl is beyond help.

218
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,610
You did that because
you took pity on me?

219
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,920
Really?

220
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,450
Goodbye.

221
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,940
MY LOVE STORY WITH YAMADA AT LV 999

222
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,730
Thank you for coming!

223
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,140
Time to go our separate
ways for now.

224
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:01,460
We have a guild war tonight,
so let's meet again online!

225
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,990
Okay!

226
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,680
Sorry I couldn't send you home, Akane.

227
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,990
SQUEAK...
Sorry I couldn't send you home, Akane.

228
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:09,720
If only I didn't have work today...
And you were lost too earlier...

229
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,950
Ruri is worried...

230
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,250
I'm okay.

231
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:17,500
What's up with that scary look, Runa?

232
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,870
I hate that girl.

233
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,530
She's sticking too close
to Bro and Yamada.

234
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,010
Just like a bitch.

235
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,520
Bi—?! Where did you
learn such a strong word?!

236
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,450
The four of us have
always been together,

237
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,260
but why do we have
to welcome her now?

238
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,940
I'll make sure to
kick her out of the guild.

239
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,870
Hey! Since we go to the same direction,
let's go together!

240
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:55,470
That's what I said for the hell of it...

241
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,680
But we barely talk now...

242
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,910
Hey, Yamada?

243
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,670
Yes?

244
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,030
So you guys meet up
like this from time to time?

245
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,840
Yes.

246
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,010
Oh, so you guys must be close!

247
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:08,470
Right.

248
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,800
Oh, yeah! Eita's really
a fun person, isn't he?

249
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,600
Yeah.

250
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,100
FIN

251
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,120
I HEARD THE GUY NEXT DOOR
Uhh...

252
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,350
INSTALLED A FENCE, HUH...
Uhh...

253
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,360
Hey, look over there.

254
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,360
PEEK

255
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,860
Oww...

256
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,970
You okay?

257
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,130
Sorry.

258
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,550
Here, take my place.

259
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,470
Oh, you don't have to.

260
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,340
It's okay.

261
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,940
Thanks.

262
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,470
Huh? Huh?!

263
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,110
Oh, they're looking at him...

264
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,670
That was surprising...

265
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,400
I thought I was the one
they were looking at.

266
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,230
SO EMBARRASSING...

267
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,750
I was also taken aback
by his cool look at first.

268
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,630
Do you like Yamada?

269
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,860
Did she see it that way?

270
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,380
No, no!
Yamada's my precious MMO friend!

271
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,620
Oh, right.

272
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,120
What are you having for dinner?

273
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,480
CHALLENGING FOR A CONVO AGAIN
What are you having for dinner?

274
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,490
CHALLENGING FOR A CONVO AGAIN
I'm not that hungry, so...

275
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,510
CHALLENGING FOR A CONVO AGAIN
Really?

276
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,870
Maybe pudding?

277
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,000
What the heck?

278
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,130
That will be 120 yen!

279
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,820
Thank you!

280
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,110
Wait... Did you really mean that earlier?

281
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,640
Yep.

282
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,500
You live alone, Yamada?

283
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,310
Yes.

284
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,680
You cook yourself?

285
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,670
Not at all.

286
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,850
So how do you eat every day?

287
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:47,400
I just bought random food at a store.

288
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,680
Huh...

289
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,660
Yamada's a high schooler, right?

290
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,830
Won't his mom
say anything about this?

291
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,070
But I can't just ask
such a personal question...

292
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,030
Yamada, do you have time?

293
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,670
Yes?

294
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,800
Wait for me here for fifteen,
I mean, ten minutes!

295
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,920
I'll be back soon!

296
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,339
Ten minutes...

297
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,160
She was so sad, and yet...

298
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,460
Yamada! Long time no see!

299
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,840
I guess she's cheered up now.

300
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,770
Yamada!

301
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,360
S-Sorry for the wait!

302
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,370
Huh?

303
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,350
Wait... You okay?

304
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:26,070
Shoot... Last time I ran for dear life
was in high school...

305
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,380
What's with the big bags?

306
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,710
Oh, this is curry.

307
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,390
I'm sure you don't
have rice at home,

308
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:38,270
so I got you some refrigerated rice.

309
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,640
I made this curry just this morning,

310
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,430
THANK GOODNESS IT DIDN'T SPILL
so it should last for two days.

311
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,560
I'm in a crisis this month,
so there's not a lot of meat inside,

312
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,820
but in exchange,

313
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:51,070
TAKE IT ALL, YOU THIEF; WAIT, WAIT
I'll give you the salad and pickled veggies...

314
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,710
TAKE IT ALL, YOU THIEF; WAIT, WAIT
I bought earlier!

315
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,320
TAKE IT ALL, YOU THIEF; WAIT, WAIT
No, um...

316
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,450
You don't really have to.

317
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:57,940
You're broke too, aren't you?

318
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,970
You won't get big if you don't eat.

319
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,520
I'LL PUT THEM HERE
You won't get big if you don't eat.

320
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,950
Well...

321
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,060
Pudding is a dessert!

322
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,960
I'LL PUT THIS IN TOO
Well, yeah, but...

323
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,960
This is a token of friendship
as fellow guild members.

324
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,190
But...

325
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,670
Your phone is ringing.

326
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,580
Oh, my phone?

327
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,390
Is it Momo?

328
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,770
Oh, it's an unknown number.

329
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,440
Hello?

330
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,520
IT SMELLS LIKE CURRY...

331
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:32,030
Uhh...

332
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,150
It's Runa.

333
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,280
Runa? What's up?

334
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,540
I got your number from my brother.

335
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,940
I'm sorry for that.

336
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,040
It's perfectly fine!

337
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,080
Even though you took
your time to come,

338
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,400
I was rude to you. I'm sorry.

339
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,550
My brother also told me
to say sorry to you...

340
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,380
Oh, you don't have to worry about it!

341
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,300
You must feel nervous
being around someone new!

342
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,860
So, if you'd like...

343
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,480
I want to play with you again...

344
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,780
This time,
I want to be friends with you...

345
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,110
Runa...

346
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,810
Okay!

347
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,380
Sure.

348
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,490
Saturday next week, right?
Sounds good to me.

349
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,980
Yeah! I can't wait too!

350
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,500
See you!

351
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,700
I get to play with Runa!

352
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,750
Oh, yeah, I could see that.

353
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,040
I thought she hated me,
but I'm so happy!

354
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,010
What does she look like in-game?

355
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,070
Do you know, Yamada?

356
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,820
A bit.

357
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,320
What's her job?
Gotta be a magician, right?

358
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,060
I wanna see her avatar!

359
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,360
What's her level now, I wonder?

360
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,190
Good for you.

361
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,610
Yeah! I'll just save her number!

362
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,540
She said Saturday, right...

363
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,660

364
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,330
RUNA SASAKI - HOME TUTOR WORK
Runa Sasaki, home tutor...

365
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,340
Of course...

366
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,590
Did I mishear it?

367
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,480
