00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:08,070
So, Tani's going to watch our surroundings,

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:10,990
we can just focus on the front.

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:12,580
Maybe we can get our K/D higher.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:12,600
Maybe we can get our K/D higher.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,450
She Got Hungover
My head hurts...

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,010
The next map won't score that much...

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,830
Wait, I keep hearing someone talking...

8
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,960
I'm telling you,
no face cam for me.

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,550
Who's that?

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:30,000
You're so persistent.

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,560
Sorry, gonna go AFK for a bit.

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,160
I'll be back soon.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,830
What's...

14
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,700
...the meaning of this?

15
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,040
Um...

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,210
Yes!

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,630
Err...

18
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,630
Info 1:
 Loss of Memory Due to Overdrinking

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,100

I...

A Man (Yamada)

00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,120
Did I just cross the line overnight?!

A Man (Yamada)

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,830
Info 4:
A Man (Yamada)
Seem that way to you?

27
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,980
Info 4:
A Man (Yamada)
No, not really!

28
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,030
Well, long story short...

29
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,760
I had to choose between
looking after you,

30
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,840
or leave you on the street last night.

31
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,210
But the latter would be too inhumane...

32
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,720
I am terribly sorry for this.

33
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,100
I am terribly sorry for this.
I really
contemplated though

34
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,680
I really
contemplated though

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,270
I shall pay you back someday...

36
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,320
You can start by going home right now.

37
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,930
Yes, I will!

38
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,690
Anyway, about your clothes
covered in puke...

39
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,270
I've already washed
and put them in the bathroom.

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,990
I've also paid for the izakaya bill...

41
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,440
I'll reimburse you right away!

42
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,080
This is bad...

43
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,790
Um, where's the bathroom?

44
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:40,550
Out the door and to the right.

45
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,700
This is just too much...

46
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,630
It's Almost Time For the Boss to Spawn

47
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,710
It's Almost Time For the Boss to Spawn
I don't think we'll be
seeing each other again, so...

48
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,300
Farewell.

49
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,590
I messed up...

50
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,550
Not to mention, I actually stayed over
at a man's room I just met...

51
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,380
My mom in Gunma, I'm sorry.

52
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,360
I'm beat...

53
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,779
I need to do my homework...

54
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,840
Huh?

55
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,020
Hang on...

56
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,800
I was wearing a necklace, wasn't I?

57
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,340
Huh? Why can't I find it?

58
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,600
Nothing...

59
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:03,200
About your clothes covered in puke...

60
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,370
I've already washed
and put them in the bathroom.

61
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,550
Could it be...

62
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,960
...that I dropped it in Yamada's room?

63
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,000
Akane Has Logged In

64
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,340
Oh, hello, Akane!

65
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,740
Oh, hello, Akane!

67
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,470
Hello, Rurihime!

68
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,180
Yamada... where is he?

69
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:28,360
Yamada... where is he?
Yamada\h

70
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,730
Yamada\h

71
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,980
He's offline!

72
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,980
I remember still wearing it at the izakaya.

73
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,640
If I were to drop it,
it'd be after that.

74
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,990
There's no other way than my dropping it
in Yamada's room when I took off my clothes.

75
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,240
What do I do...?

76
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,750
That necklace was the first
present Takuma gave to me...

77
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,500
Huh? Akane's frozen still?

78
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,130
Is she feeling down?

79
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,900
Got a lot of stuff happening IRL now...

80
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,890
Got a lot of stuff happening IRL now...
Oh... You in trouble?

81
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:04,970
Got a lot of stuff happening IRL now...
Oh... You in trouble?

82
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,640
Got a lot of stuff happening IRL now...
Oh... You in trouble?
Something Like That...

83
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,230
I'll listen to you, if you'd like!

84
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:16,300
I'm everyone's master after all,
so please rely on me!

85
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,280
Rurihime's as cute as always...

86
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,510
Rurihime's as cute as always...
So soothing...

87
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,740
So soothing...

88
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,970
I see...

89
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,370
So you got dumped by your boyfriend,
and lost your treasured accessory.

90
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,150
I feel you.

91
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:33,530
I also get a lot of presents from my fans,

92
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,000
and all of them are so precious.

93
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:35,750
There's happy memories in each, too.

94
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,140
There's happy memories in each, too.
Fans... A lot...

95
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,300
But I just don't know
where to put them now.

96
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:41,660
But I just don't know
where to put them now.
Being cute is a sin

97
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,700
Being cute is a sin
Wow...

98
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,760
Being cute is a sin

99
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,010
Yamada Has Logged In

100
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,890
Hello, Yamada!

101
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,890
Hi.

102
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,430
He's finally here!

103
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,480
Umm...

104
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,950
Yama! Yama! Yamaya!
Yamada!

105
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,410
Yama! Yama! Yamaya!

106
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,230
Why don't you join us for a romance talk?
Yama! Yama! Yamaya!

107
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,640
It's almost time
for the boss to spawn, so nope.

108
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,490
Hunting for boss again?

109
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,000
There's a 200% XP campaign now.

110
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,360
Wow, for how long?

111
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:06,280
This whole week

112
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:06,320
This whole week

113
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,660
I see!
This whole week

114
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:06,700
I see!
This whole week

115
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,190
I see!
I didn't notice at all
This whole week

116
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,660
I see!
I didn't notice at all
This whole week
I can't get in their circle with this topic...

117
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:07,700
I can't get in their circle with this topic...
This whole week
I see!
I didn't notice at all

118
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,370
I can't get in their circle with this topic...
This whole week
I see!
There was a notice at midnight
I didn't notice at all

119
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,330
I can't get in their circle with this topic...

120
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,120
I'll just whisper to him.

121
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,620
\hYamada!
\hI think i might've dropped my necklace in your room?
\hDid you see it?

122
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,370
Huh? So he saw it?

123
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,750
Nope\h

124
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,750
That was quick.
He should've searched for some more...

125
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,480
You should join us

126
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:24,970
in comforting Akane now!

127
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,470
in comforting Akane now!
Go see the chat
log for context

128
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,290
Not a chance.

129
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,100
Meanie!

130
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,220
Anyway...

131
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,140
This guild's storage slot is always full,

132
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:31,260
I can't use it.

133
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,020
I can't use it.
Cramped

134
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,400
Cramped
Oh? You're right! It's getting full!

135
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,350
I never checked it at all!

136
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,290
I never checked it at all!
Hmm...

137
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,020
Hmm...
I always get rid of them every time,

138
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,720
Hmm...
but it's always like this again.

139
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,490
Hmm...
Now that's a mystery!

140
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:49,690
If it's not in Yamada's room,
then it's in the izakaya?

141
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,370
Maybe something put them
all here out of good will?

142
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,700
Oh, that was me—

143
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,870
Huh?! All this junk?!

144
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,370
Calling it junk is too far!

145
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,960
Maybe a guild member wants
to help out beginner members!

146
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,300
Even a beginner who just
started three minutes ago

147
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,120
would have better equipment...

148
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,220
Now, now.

149
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:09,970
What if it's a guild member who's online now?

150
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,470
What if it's a guild member who's online now?
No

151
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,990
What if it's a guild member who's online now?

152
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,220
If they see this chat, they'll be shocked.

153
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,100
It was me.

154
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,100
It was me...

155
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,110
I thought beginner members would be
able to use the stuff i no longer use, so...
It was me...

156
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,150
It was me...
I thought beginner members would be
able to use the stuff i no longer use, so...
I'm sorry, it must be a bother...

157
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,990
Not at all!
I thought beginner members would be
able to use the stuff i no longer use, so...
I'm sorry, it must be a bother...
You're really kind, Akane!!
It was me...

158
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,740
It is a bother.

159
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,240
Yamada!

160
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,799
I had to get rid of all
the junk every time, though.

161
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,530
Don't call it junk!

162
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:37,370
Akane did it out of her good heart!

163
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,500
Akane did it out of her good heart!
Good Heart...

164
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,059
Akane did it out of her good heart!

165
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,570
Be sure to sort them out first.

166
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,789
The storage slot is limited.

167
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,880
Yamada!

168
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,540
Couldn't you have put it

169
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,590
in a nicer way, Yamada?

170
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,680
in a nicer way, Yamada?
Akane Has Logged Out

171
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,390
Akane Has Logged Out

172
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,100
Ah...

173
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,220
Ah...

174
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:00,480
Ah...
Akane's still not used to this game yet,
Gosh, you're a dummie, Yamada!
so you should be nice to her!

175
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,990
Oww...

176
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,380
Oww...
Crack?

177
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:08,990
Crack?

178
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,490
Did I step on something?

179
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,460
For real...?

180
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,150
I hate Yamada!

181
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,070
Akane.

182
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,840
Sorry.

183
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,610
There was something wrong with me.

184
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,450
But I've finally opened my eyes now.

185
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,120
Takuma...

186
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,370
Here...

187
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,530
A token of apology.
Please take it.

188
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,580
I'm so happy, Takuma!

189
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,630
Takuma... Takuma!

190
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,390
Takuma!

191
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,650
A nightmare...

192
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,070
It's more like a dream come true.

193
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,410
Aren't you making fun of this,
my main ma'am Momo?

194
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,420
Not really. I was just getting tired
of your bringing up Takuma every time.

195
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,080
That was just a fake smile.

196
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,920
Anyway, I want to hear about your meeting
a hot dude from an MMO!

197
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,840
Did you really spend a night together
and nothing happened?

198
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,020
That again?
I told you, nothing happened.

199
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,400
Yamada was just helping me out.

200
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:02,290
I just remembered about
my necklace Takuma gave me...

201
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:05,670
I think I might've dropped it
in Yamada's room...

202
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,380
What are you gonna use the thing

203
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,520
from someone who dumped you for?

204
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,040
Guy who
 dumped you
from someone who dumped you for?

205
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,440
Guy who
 dumped you
How clingy of you.

206
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,230
How clingy of you.

207
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,110
How clingy of you.
Clingy

208
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,850
You do be like that, huh?

209
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,530
You'd always prioritise your
schedule for your boyfriend.

210
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,490
You even started playing that MMO when your
boyfriend told you, despite zero interest.

211
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,540
Come to think of it,

212
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,650
you made him a handmade lunchbox
right after you started dating, right?

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,430
It's just heavy obsession all around.

214
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,310
I won't talk about Takuma again,
so please let me off the hook...

215
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,700
I'm glad you understand.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,820
18:00...

217
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,640
I guess I'll just do my laundry,
and then...

218
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,160
What's on TV today?

219
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,650
I've got nothing to do...

220
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,150
It's boring to play a game solo, too.

221
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,720
It is a bother.

222
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:58,620
I haven't logged in again since then,

223
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:03,030
but I wonder if that annoying afro
is still as lifeless as always.

224
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,660
Sorry, Akito.

225
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,060
Sorry for hesitating,
even though I stopped you...

226
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,240
You see...

227
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,940
Um...

228
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,110
You know...

229
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:20,300
A bunch of high schoolers...
Is she going to confess?

230
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,060
Being young sure is nice...
You sure are popular, boy.

231
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:31,120
I also once confessed to my senior
like that back in high school.

232
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,300
I like you!

233
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,730
I already have a girlfriend.

234
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,610
The handsome senior Saito...

235
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,210
Is he doing okay?
Fleeting Memory...

236
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,780
Fleeting Memory...
Um... So...

237
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,860
Fleeting Memory...
Are you done?

238
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,070
It's been seven minutes
since you stopped me.

239
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:50,540
Could you just wrap it up
and say it to me next time?

240
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,670
Sorry, but it's almost time
for the boss to spawn.

241
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,820
Excuse me.

242
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,430
Hold it!

243
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,720
I just screamed...

244
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,090
Right, of course you'd have forgotten.

245
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,870
It's me, Akane!
The one you saved in that MMO event!

246
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,360
Oh, the lady who drank too
much and puked in my room.

247
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,920
I'm really sorry about that.

248
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,330
Wait, that's not it!

249
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,900
Isn't he a bit cruel?

250
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,370
No matter how you look at it,
she was confessing to you!

251
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,880
You should've listened
to her thoroughly.

252
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,160
Was I... being confessed to?

253
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,890
You should actually learn the subtleties

254
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,030
of human emotions
instead of a game, you know?

255
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,110
I get that a lot.

256
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,130
So you're a high schooler, huh?

257
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,760
Yes.

258
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,560
That answer why you kept
drinking juice at the izakaya.

259
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,780
Yes.

260
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,420
What year are you in?

261
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,520
Third year.

262
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,900
That's Tosei Academy's uniform...

263
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,780
So he's actually got the brains, huh?

264
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,280
The standard score
there is something else.

265
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:09,980
Actually, I've been looking for you.

266
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,190
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,090
I found it shortly after that,
but I stepped on it.

268
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,020
The heart... is split in two...

269
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,130
Thanks for going all the way for this.

270
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,330
Have you been carrying
this all the time?

271
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,800
I heard you commute
to the same station,

272
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,820
so I thought I'd see you around here...

273
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,980
I should've logged in, then!
You must be confused, right?

274
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,800
No...

275
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,100
Thanks.

276
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,170
I meant to throw that away,
so don't mind it.

277
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,770
I'll be going now, then.

278
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:06,510
Wait!

279
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,330
Here, use this.

280
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,560
You don't have to return it.

281
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,910
See you, then.

282
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,910
The rain last night in Kanto region
has moved up north,

283
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,280
and it'll be sunny today.

284
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,800
We'll have a full moon tonight...

285
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,620
Here, use this.

286
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,420
I meant to throw that away,
so don't mind it.

287
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,880
Coming!

288
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,010
Hello! Tagawa Express here!

289
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,450
We have packages
from Mistress Kinoshita!

290
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:17,460
We'll carry them inside.

291
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,390
Thank you for using our service!

292
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,460
Dear Akane

293
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,900
Dear Akane
About your room in Gunma,

294
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,970
Dear Akane
I want to turn it into my training room,

295
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,530
I want to turn it into my training room,

296
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,900
so I'm sending you all your stuff.

297
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,980
Sincerely, your mama...

298
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,900
So, why am I here?

299
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,730
So, why am I here?
I just got
back from work...

300
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,070
Help me, Momo!
I don't have space to walk around!

301
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,450
Some stuff just came in from home,
but look at all these boxes!

302
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,030
What do I do with these?

303
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,790
What a pain.
Just throw them all away.

304
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,260
Let's start from that
big bear over there...

305
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:03,310
Wait! It contains precious memories of Grandma!

306
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,630
Shut up!
Wait! It contains precious memories of Grandma!

307
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,000
Grandma—

308
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,130
All right, next!

309
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:08,839
Next!

310
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,010
Next!

311
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,829
Akane!

312
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,940
These two are in the way...

313
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,900
Where are we putting these?

314
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,780
This umbrella's still new,
so you're still gonna use this, right?

315
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,700
This necklace's already broken,
so can we throw this away?

316
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,380
Be sure to sort them out first.

317
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,330
The storage slot is limited.

318
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,750
Sort out...

319
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,550
Huh?

320
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,290
What was once precious...

321
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,750
I can't keep them all with me forever.

322
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,810
So you're not throwing
that away in the end.

323
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
But...

324
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,050
I'll just throw away the rest...

325
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:14,860
They are all...

326
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,340
...no longer important to me.

327
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,880
There
There

328
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,910
All right! Let's celebrate
this with a BBQ session!

329
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,760
On you, of course!

330
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,180
I'm facing financial difficulties now,
so please go easy on me.

331
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,410
Yes?

332
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,750
Yamada! I'm here to return your umbrella!

333
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,780
He really is a hot dude!

334
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,040
Name's Momo!

335
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,380
Nice to meetcha, Yamada!

336
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:11,950
Nice to meetcha, Yamada!
Annoyed...

337
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,300
Annoyed...

338
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,860
Here!

339
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,010
Huh? You seem at a loss?

340
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,060
I just... can't put it into words...

341
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,560
Yamada, sorry if Akane
keeps troubling you.

342
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,440
But, if you'd like, while we're at it,

343
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,580
please marry me
on the assumption that we're dating!

344
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,950
I'm seriously considering
calling the police on you.

345
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,550
She reeks
alcohol...

346
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,790
She reeks
alcohol...
I told you, you don't have to return it.

347
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,230
She reeks
alcohol...

348
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,340
She reeks
alcohol...
If anything, it's troubling me.

349
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,580
She reeks
alcohol...
Umm...

350
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:52,690
Well, while I'm also here
to return the umbrella...

351
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,870
I'm also here to say thanks.

352
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:01,760
I'm glad you were there
during that event.

353
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,780
If I were alone...

354
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,610
...I'd surely have it rough.

355
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,540
So...

356
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,540
You okay?

357
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,750
I really am grateful.

358
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,860
All right, we'll go home
before you can call the police!

359
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,020
Please do.

360
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,920
Momo, we're going home.

361
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,420
Let's walk now.

362
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,600
Walk...

363
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,980
Yamada

364
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,100
Momo, watch your steps.

365
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,430
Steps...

366
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,420
By the way...

367
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,150
Ruri...

368
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,990
The guild master was worried about you.

369
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:08,400
She said you haven't
logged in again since that day.

370
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,640
So...

371
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:17,910
Well... If you're free, then...

372
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,840
I will!

373
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,880
I'll do it! I'll do it right
when I get home!

374
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,020
You want to do it too?

375
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,560
No, I'll go sleep.

376
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,740
You won't?

377
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,300
Nope.

378
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,540
You won't do it?

379
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,760
I'll do... the marriage.

380
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,540
There's more of them now...

381
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,560
There's more of them now...
Forced to log in

382
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,210
Forced to log in
What do we do, Yamada?

383
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,090
Yamada?

384
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,340
Hello?

385
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,590
Yamada?

386
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,090
Earth to Yamada?

387
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,980
Yamada? Yamada?!

388
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,470
Yamada!

389
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:34,470
Yamada! Yamadayama!
