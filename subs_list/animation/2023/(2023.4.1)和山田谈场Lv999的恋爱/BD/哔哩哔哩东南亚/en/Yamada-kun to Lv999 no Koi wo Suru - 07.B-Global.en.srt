1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,040
Yamada? What's wrong?

2
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,530
Your hair hit my eyeball...

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,440
What?! Sorry!

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,730
Are you okay?
Did it get in your eye?

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,200
Let me see. Which eye?

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:29,100
I'm... okay.

7
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,729
Sorry, Yamada!
You apologise too, Runa!

8
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,500
S-Sorry...

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,230
I'm sowwy...

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,620
I'll put my hair up.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,490
Um... I'll go back home for a bit.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:45,920
Huh?!

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,090
Need to grab the needed tools for this.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,520
But...

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,920
I'll be back soon.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,830
Won't you get tired going back and forth?

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,170
I'd feel bad...

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,330
Don't worry.

19
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,430
It's close by.

20
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,080
Ugly
Idiot

21
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,410
Ugly
Idiot
I don't mind being bullied...

22
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,820
Ugly
Idiot

23
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,110
As long as you're here, it's fine, Akito.

24
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,440
Even if we become adults,
let's stay together.

25
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,810
We can't know for sure.

26
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,010
Do You Want to  Feel  at Ease?

27
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,350
Do You Want to  Feel  at Ease?
Welcome.

28
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,010
Do You Want to  Feel  at Ease?

29
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,370
Would you like a bag for that?

30
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,770
Yes, please.

31
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,270
I see you always buy this, Sir.

32
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,280
This tea brand taste good, right?

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,680
Ah, yes...

34
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,560
I also like this one.

35
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you for your patronage!

36
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,520
Um...

37
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,920
I-If I may,
could you tell me your name?

38
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:58,570
The uniform you're always wearing is
from Tosei Academy, right?

39
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,550
I'm actually an alumnus there.

40
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,720
I've been wanting to talk to you...

41
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,440
Sorry, but I'm busy now.

42
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:15,170
Of course you are...

43
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,300
I'm sorry...

44
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,260
I'm sorry...
Why is she looking like that?

45
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:21,700
I'm sorry...

46
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,710
I'm in a hurry...

47
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:26,720
What am I supposed to
talk about with a store clerk?

48
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,800
You've always been like that, huh...

49
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,570
I don't know.

50
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,470
I'm not fond of girls.

51
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,700
Maybe I'm better off
not approaching them.

52
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,410
I'm back.

53
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,930
No one's here...

54
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,500
Yamada

55
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:18,380
Naptime After Lunch

56
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,160
They're sleeping so peacefully...

57
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,290
I'll just fix this in silence.

58
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,180
That was close.

59
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,960
Sorry. I'll put my hair up.

60
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:55,940
Yamada

61
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,270
Riiiing

62
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,850
Riiiing
Yamada!

63
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:46,900
Riiiing

64
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,140
Why are you here?!
Wait, what?!

65
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,410
I'm your fan!

66
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,270
Oh, yeah... I remember seeing him...

67
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,370
Why are you here?!

68
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,380
Well, stuff...

69
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,480
What do you mean by "stuff"?!
Fill me in, will you?!

70
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,880
What a drag...

71
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,260
Don't tell me Akane's really...

72
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,890
Let me introduce you
to my new boyfriend...

73
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,140
No, I'm not.

74
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,320
I guess not, huh...
After thinking about it,

75
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,390
it was obviously a farce led by Akane...

76
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,450
She's an open book, after all.

77
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,130
Besides, I always check
all your SNS every second!

78
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,650
All normal! No females detected!
All business as usual!

79
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,720
I won't have any weird ideas
about this, so rest assured.

80
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,169
Oh, right.
You see,

81
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,390
I wanted to return something,
so I came here.

82
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,940
We don't meet at all on campus,

83
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,789
and I don't have any means
to contact her either.

84
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:48,080
With every lunch box and plate
she gave me alongside the food,

85
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,100
I never bothered to return
every single one of them,

86
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,110
so it just kind of piled up...

87
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,620
There's like five of these boxes,

88
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,890
so I'd feel bad if I didn't return them...

89
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:58,980
so I'd feel bad if I didn't return them...
Lunch Box Tower

90
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,390
Lunch Box Tower
Isn't that just too many?

91
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,000
But well, I'm sure she doesn't
want to see me again now,

92
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,070
and when I thought of cleaning up
and seeing these, I thought of this as well.

93
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,410
I've made you lunch!

94
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:15,500
Is she doing well?

95
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,390
I got so worried...

96
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,170
If I see her smile,
I can feel at ease too.

97
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,320
She's... probably doing well.

98
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,840
Do you... want to see it for yourself?

99
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,940
Do you want to feel
at ease by seeing her?

100
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,570
I...

101
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,730
I'll just go home.

102
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,260
Sorry for being so self-centred.

103
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,350
Please don't tell Akane that I came visit.

104
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,280
Just tell her that these boxes
just appeared out of the blue somehow!

105
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,630
I'm counting on you!

106
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,290
I'll be rooting for you too
in your next tourney!

107
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,990
Stare

108
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,350
Uhh...

109
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,710
Since when have you been there?

110
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,810
Um... Lunch boxes...

111
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,060
...have appeared...

112
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,750
It's Obviously a Bust, But He's Fulfilling His Promise

113
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,390
There's no way they suddenly
appeared out of nowhere!

114
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,160
It's funny when you say it
with a straight face!

115
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,900
Thanks for handling these.

116
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,370
Um, I'll return this to you.

117
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,730
Wait, come to think of it,
my hair's down again!

118
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,680
Yes, I took it off.

119
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,330
Huh?

120
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,560
I took it off while you were sleeping.

121
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,920
Is that so...

122
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,840
Yes. I'm sorry.

123
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,790
But why?

124
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,860
You didn't have to...

125
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't know.

126
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,300
I just felt like I had to...

127
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,590
Why, I wonder?

128
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,690
Wh-What does he mean...?

129
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,100
It's Eita.

130
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,000
Hello.

131
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,280
Yes.

132
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,010
So can I tell you the missing parts now?

133
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:20,630
Oh, hang on.
I'll write it down.

134
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,640
Hmm...

135
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,520
What was that?

136
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,870
Akane Kinoshita

137
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,180
Akane Kinoshita
Miss Akane Kinoshita, right?

138
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,030
Akane Kinoshita

139
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,870
Do you have a time preference?

140
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,200
As long as I don't have any classes,
anytime is fine.

141
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,570
Oh, now that's reassuring.

142
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:46,450
Your university's close by too,
so it's easy to commute here.

143
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,040
Yes!

144
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:49,830
We're quite a busy store,

145
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:53,040
so we'd like you to work as much as possible,
but is that okay with you?

146
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,960
Yes! I'll do my best!

A part-time job at a convenience store?
You actually applied?

149
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,770
A part-time job at a convenience store?
You actually applied?

150
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:03,320
Just for a short time.
It's the one close to our college.

151
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,240
You know, the one along the road,
and the manager's got long hair.

152
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,560
Oh, that one?

153
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,590
Let me know if your shifts have been set.

154
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,430
I'll drop by.

155
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,690
Oh, please do!

156
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,030
But why a part-time job?

157
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,320
You got your broken PC fixed, right?

158
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,100
That's right, but Eita...

159
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,340
I mean, a guild member exchanged
my PC parts for free, so...

160
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,500
It's quite pricey
when you buy them, I guess.

161
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,960
I can't just take them all for free,

162
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,100
so I'll just ask them
about that in-game today.

163
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,180
You're actually asking them in-game?

164
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,930
Yep.

165
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,970
Well, they saved your bacon,
so of course you'd want to pay them back.

166
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,170
Momo!

167
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,660
Oh, they're calling me.

168
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,450
All right, I'll continue my mixer now.

169
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,950
Let's talk again sometime.

170
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:47,970
Okay!

171
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,820
Momo, you took your
sweet time in the restroom.

172
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,780
The guys are waiting for you.

173
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,320
Sorry, got a call from a friend.

174
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
A friend?

175
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,980
Akane said she's starting a part-time job.

176
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,020
Oh, Kinoshita.

177
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:04,050
By the way, I've never seen her
in any of our mixers these days.

178
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,960
She's busy with her MMO now,
just let her be.

179
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,500
All right!
I'll definitely find my prince today!

180
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,000
Momo Maeda
The mixer's done! I failed in finding a prince again today!

181
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,080
Momo Maeda

182
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,290
Momo Maeda
Oh, my...

183
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,690
The men up to her standard
are hard to come by...

184
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:20,920
Just Finished Bath

185
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,960
Just Finished Bath
Currently Wearing Cotton Pack

186
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,300
Just Finished Bath
Currently Wearing Cotton Pack
If you give up,
it's game over.

187
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:32,210
But, is there such a thing as finding
the ideal person in the first meeting...

188
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,160
...in this life, I wonder?

189
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,810
Akane Has Logged In

190
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,820
Oh!

191
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,570
Hey, Rurihime!

192
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,570
Akane!

193
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,830
Long time no see!

194
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,070
Hello, hello!

195
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:47,690
Hello, hello!
The Type to Come Back to Her Senses

196
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,950
The Type to Come Back to Her Senses
It's Eita...

197
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,580
The Type to Come Back to Her Senses
It's Eita...
The Honest Type

198
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,200
The Type to Come Back to Her Senses
The Honest Type

199
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,420
What were you doing?

200
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,710
Just having a meeting
with the submaster now.

201
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,380
Huh?! Submaster?!

202
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:57,720
Huh?! Submaster?!
Submaster: Guildmaster's Sub

203
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,210
Submaster: Guildmaster's Sub

204
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,050
Where?

205
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,750
Where?
I've never met them!

206
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,960
I've never met them!
Over there!

207
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,460
I've never met them!
Huh?

208
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,110
Right there!

209
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,360
So small! The submaster's so small!

210
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,220
He's of the Micronest race.

211
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,660
They become so small
when not in combat!

212
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,760
It's more like a joke race,

213
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,290
but they can get strong
depending on how to grind.

214
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,040
Right, takezo?

215
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,440
Right, takezo?
He becomes a
giant in combat

216
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,540
He becomes a
giant in combat
Akane, hello!

217
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,190
I'm Takezo Kamota.

218
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,800
My avatar name is my name,
in alphabet.

219
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,760
Huh?! Mr. Kamota?!

220
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,780
It's takezo here.

221
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,300
Oh, right. Sorry.

222
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,860
takezo rarely gets out of the dungeons,

223
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,310
so it's also rare
to see him in the guild room!

224
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,100
He's so cute, but I can't see him
if I pan out the camera even for a bit.

225
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,810
I feel you!

226
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,220
Oh, right.
There's something I want to ask you.

227
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,450
What's that?

228
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,710
About the total fee
for fixing my PC parts the other day...

229
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,700
How much did it cost?

230
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,570
Not Telling!
Rurihime

231
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,830
Not Telling!
Rurihime
Huh? But why?

232
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,580
Huh? But why?
Not Telling!
Rurihime

233
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,500
Not Telling!
Rurihime

234
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,710
Rurihime
Not Telling!
Rurihime
It's all old hand-me-down parts, so don't sweat it

235
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,240
But I can't have it.

236
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,220
What should I do, takezo?

237
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,230
I can see where you two are coming from,
so this is difficult...

238
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,540
Why don't we make a compromise,

239
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,480
and have Akane join us
as well in our plan earlier?

240
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,960
Oh, that sounds nice!

241
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:50,990
Plan?

242
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,140
Oh, shoot! It's Yamada!

243
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,010
Huh?! No way!

244
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,410
Wanna say hi to him?

245
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,770
But what should we talk about?

246
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,560
Uhh... stuff about game?

247
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,230
Oh, what was that, again?
FP-something...

248
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,750
Oh, someone's approaching him.

249
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,240
Yo.

250
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,550
Hey.

251
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:24,020
Taking out the trash?
That looks heavy.

252
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,880
The girls are always on to you, huh...

253
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,650
If you signed up for the beauty pageant,
you'd win in an instant.

254
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,240
Isn't it a waste to reject it again today?

255
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,250
But the committee don't seem
to have given up yet.

256
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,350
They asked me to convince you.

257
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:46,360
If you get yourself a girlfriend,

258
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,780
there'll be a lot of girls crying, I bet.

259
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,350
It'll be chaos in the school.

260
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:51,930
Your point?

261
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,930
Nothing.

262
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,430
You free today?
Wanna play a game after school?

263
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:56,620
You free today?
Wanna play a game after school?
Sure

264
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,140
Sure

265
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,310
Sure
Yamada!

266
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:58,910
Yamada!

267
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,940
Your phone's been ringing here!

268
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,260
Thanks.

269
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,190
Huh?

270
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:10,490
What's up with that earlier?
You could've replied with more feeling to it.

271
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,100
Like this...
"Thank you!"

272
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,940
- Or something.
- It was Eita who said "always", huh...

273
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,250
- Or maybe, "Thanks, my kittens!"
- It was Eita who said "always", huh...

274
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:19,950
Also...

275
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,170
The vibrations were so loud
against the desk, so...

276
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,460
World History in Details

277
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,320
World History in Details
I put a towel over it.

278
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,680
World History in Details

279
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,220
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:42,570
Thank you, Tsubaki.

281
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,390
I saw your match yesterday online.

282
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,410
Your aim was sloppy,
and your reaction slow.

283
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,530
You got rusty or what?

284
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,710
You were always
slacking off in that MMO,

285
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,040
so you got bad at FPS now, right?

286
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,270
The server used yesterday
was from abroad,

287
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,390
so it was lagging...

288
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,920
Stop blaming the connection.

289
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,150
Yes.

290
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:29,230
Our guild Chocolate Rabbit will be going to the Tosei Academy school festival which will be open
soon to the public! Regarding this, I want to ask Yamada to get some tickets for the guild
members here are the members joining:
Guild Breaking News

291
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,950
Eita Sasaki, Runa Sasaki, Takezo Kamota,
and our sponsor, Akane Kinoshita

292
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,150
Eita Sasaki, Runa Sasaki, Takezo Kamota,
and our sponsor, Akane Kinoshita
Sponsor?

293
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,570
Eita Sasaki, Runa Sasaki, Takezo Kamota,
and our sponsor, Akane Kinoshita

294
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,990
You're playing FOS, right?

295
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,440
Yes.

296
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,570
Is it fun?

297
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,180
Yes.

298
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,290
Wh-What is this?

299
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,770
An external GPU dock.

300
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,230
G-What?
It's bigger than the PC...

301
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,390
G-What?
It's bigger than the PC...
Please don't remove it when playing the game.

302
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:25,420
Please don't remove it when playing the game.

303
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,280
At all?

304
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,810
Yes.

305
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:28,000
Yes.
At all...

306
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,660
At all...

307
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:29,770
At all...
But it feels faster than before.

308
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,100
But it feels faster than before.

309
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:35,040
It's even smoother now.

310
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,050
How? Did you also fix this?

311
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,400
You're so amazing, Yamada.

312
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,220
All I did was exchange the parts.

313
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,040
Most of the parts
were leftovers from Eita.

314
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,790
Alongside the faster GPU,

315
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,660
I think it also got faster from exchanging
the last-gen CPU, doubling the memory,

316
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,660
and also swapping the HDD with an SSD.

317
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,990
I don't really get it, but...

318
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,350
So the insides are mostly different now?

319
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,810
Well, yeah.

320
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,300
Thanks, Yamada.

321
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,740
You've really saved my bacon.

322
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:11,910
No problem.

323
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
He really is a god...

324
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,440
A Few Days Later

325
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,160
Today, as a private welcome
back party event for Akane,

326
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,490
the three of us will be
on a dungeon guide tour!

327
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,540
Let's go!

328
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,950
Let's go!
The Third Guy

329
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,500
P-Please take care of me!

330
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,330
No need to be so tense.

331
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,970
With your level now,
I'm sure you can tackle it today,

332
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,050
so don't worry.

333
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:45,710
We'll support you
with everything we have.

334
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,770
Mr. Kamota's so nice
both in-game and IRL...

335
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,600
His avatar also has
the Mr. Kamota aura,

336
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,610
I think I like it.

337
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,600
All right, guys! Let's go now!

338
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,760
Off to the dungeon!

339
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,820
Yeah!

340
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,210
All right! I'll have to do my best
to contribute at least a bit!

341
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,330
GPU

342
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,930
Huh?

343
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:31,430
Huuuuuuuuuh?!

344
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:38,150
The gap is something else...

345
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,780
The gap is something else...
A real demon god...

346
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,020
A real demon god...
