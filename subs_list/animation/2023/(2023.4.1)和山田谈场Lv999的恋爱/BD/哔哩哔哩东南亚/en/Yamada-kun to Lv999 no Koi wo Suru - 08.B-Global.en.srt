00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,100
Sorry for the wait!

00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,200
There she is!

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,870
You're late, Akane!

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,480
Sorry!

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:24,380
They suddenly called me to help out
at work last night...

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,250
I had to finish my paper after that,
so I couldn't get enough sleep...

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,500
For real?

9
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,970
It must be tough for the convenience store
to be shorthanded too.

10
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,260
Hey!

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,020

12
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,910

Eita's really into festivals, that's why.

Huh? Wait! Wait for me!

25
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,230
Wait up!

00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,580
Come to Our Cosplay Cafe!

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,800
So this is Yamada's school...

28
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:43,020
If That's the Case, I Think It'd  Be...

29
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,400
There's a lot of stalls here.

30
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,650
Do you want to eat something, Runa?

31
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,770
Do you want to eat something, Runa?
Sponsor

32
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,080
Do you want to eat something, Runa?

33
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,230
I don't want to.

34
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:51,920
Huh?

35
00:02:55,940 --> 00:03:00,710
She'll be applying for this school next year,
so she's really nervous now.

36
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,370
Oh...

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,310
Runa, just relax!

38
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,670
This might be a good chance
to get used to the place!

39
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,670
I have a weak mentality,
so not happening.

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,920
Two patients here need directions~

47
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,370
Where should we go?

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,950
Tasty  Takoyaki  at the Courtyard

49
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,590
My stomach hurts.

50
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,740
I got too nervous,
my stomach hurts.

51
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,750
I can't.

52
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,060
If I'm this timid,
my entrance exam will surely...

53
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,590
All right, stop.

54
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,130
Let's go to the toilet.

55
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,360
I just got out of the haunted house
with Mr. Kamota now!

56
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,790
Let's link up for a bit
after about 15 minutes!

57
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,920
Okay.

58
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,240
Speaking of which,
I wonder if Yamada plans to join as well?

59
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,130
Speaking of which,
I wonder if Yamada plans to join as well?
I never asked
him, though...

60
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:23,620
I never asked
him, though...

61
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,750
Let's ask him.

62
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,580
Wait, I guess this would make him
think that I want to see him.

63
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,500
Well, I'll find out later anyway,
even without having to ask him.

64
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,480
That scared me!

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,520
You okay?

66
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,890
They just collapsed!

67
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,390
Oh, wow, you okay? We'll do it.

68
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,640
Thanks.

69
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,060
Let's put them in the classroom.

70
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,520
- Yamada—

71
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,650
- Yamada!
- Yamada—

72
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,940
The Ethical Kishida...

73
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,790
...is joining the First Year Fighting
Game Contest, but his moves are so fast!

74
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,440
It feels like...

75
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,430
He's smiling...

76
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,500
He's smiling...
It's difficult to approach him now.

77
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,510
He's smiling...
It's difficult to approach him now.
The hand no longer has a destination

78
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,500
He's smiling...
The hand no longer has a destination

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,000
- Oh, we putting these inside? I'll help.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
- I wonder if he'd face my way.
- Oh, we putting these inside? I'll help.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,880
- Oh, we putting these inside? I'll help.

82
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,290
Hey, Yamada.

83
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,220
Ah... There he goes...

84
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,190
Oh, well.

85
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:30,250
He looks busy,
so of course he won't notice.

86
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,270
Good grief...

87
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,790
I told them to clean up
starting from the unused boxes...

88
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,700
But they kept the boxes outside once done.

89
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,240
Everyone's just too sloppy.

90
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,140
Tsubaki, can I head out for a bit?

91
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,040
Sure, but where to?

92
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,260
Stuff.

93
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,540
This is taking too long...

94
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,180
I should check up on her.

95
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,640
Are you alone?

96
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,900
You... noticed me?

97
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,220
Yes.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,540
I meant to say hi to you,
but there was some trouble inside...

99
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,580
Anyway, why are you alone...

100
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,940
Why...

101
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,950
...are you smiling?

102
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,120
It's nothing.

103
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,610
Runa seems to be nervous coming here.

104
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,610
She's been in the toilet for a while,

105
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:09,240
but she's taking too long, I got worried.

106
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,860
So I was just about to check up on her.

107
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,000
I can't... At this rate, I won't be able
to pull through the entrance exam...

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
You're not having a fever,
The problem of
weak mentality...

109
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,260
The problem of
weak mentality...
so just lie down and see how things go.

110
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,120
Yamada, what are you doing?

111
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,100
I'm letting Eita know...

112
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,580
No, no, no! Don't tell him!
He'll definitely drag me back home!

113
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,920
But we can't just...

114
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,150
I haven't eaten anything good,
and visited any of the attractions!

115
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,040
You said your stomach hurts, right?

116
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,280
I want to eat so many things here!

117
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,660
That's why I haven't eaten
anything since last night!

118
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,380
That's the culprit.

119
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,160
Oh, I'll just buy you some food
and bring it here, then.

120
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,520
You must've forgotten,
 but i'm the sponsor today

121
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,040
You must've forgotten,
 but i'm the sponsor today
Be sure to eat up once you get better.

122
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,720
Okay, then...

123
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,370
Crepe, cheesedog, takoyaki...

124
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,250
Also, they're selling pork miso soup
at the courtyard, so I want that too.

125
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,800
And also, the limited festival
t-shirt is a must-have.

126
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,390
Yeah, yeah.

127
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,640
Where are they selling the t-shirt?
Akane

128
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:18,710
Where are they selling the t-shirt?
Akane
Yamada

129
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,900
Akane
Yamada
I'll show you.

130
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,830
Take care...

131
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,180
Yamada, is it okay for you
to skip working with your class?

132
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,490
Look over there!

133
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,570
- Who's that?
- Yes.

134
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,350
- No way! His girlfriend?!
- I meant to leave in the afternoon, too.

135
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,690
- For real?
- I meant to leave in the afternoon, too.

136
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:36,750
That's great, then.

137
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:38,179
- Gosh, he's with a girl...

138
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,610
- Gosh, he's with a girl...
- It's all backstage work,

139
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,210
- Doesn't he have a girlfriend?
- so I'm pretty much free when the event starts.

140
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:42,950
- No, he doesn't, I think.
- Huh... What's your class doing, Yamada?

141
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,390
- His girlfriend?!
- Huh... What's your class doing, Yamada?

142
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,050
- I can't stand him having one!
- Huh... What's your class doing, Yamada?

143
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,880
We're doing a giant labyrinth outside,
collabing with the next door class.

144
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,020
There's no way!

145
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,050
Anyway,

146
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,190
Bed of Nails
- Is she his girlfriend?
- aren't we being stared at by everyone?

147
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,390
Bed of Nails
- Who's that girl?
- aren't we being stared at by everyone?

148
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,940
Bed of Nails
Oh, you noticed? Thank goodness...

149
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,950
Feels like my back's full of nails...
I should keep my distance.

150
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,480
I'm sorry...

151
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,040
Oh, it's you, Yamada!

152
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,730
You're hanging around here?

153
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,760
So you're finally joining
the beauty pageant this year, huh?

154
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,510
Finally couldn't escape
after three years, eh!

155
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,430
Oh, you with your girl now?
Smacksmacksmacksmack
Smacksmacksmacksmack

156
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,470
I thought you were just a popular prick,

157
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,550
I thought you were just a popular prick,
You should resist
 for a bit, Yamada...

158
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,650
You should resist
 for a bit, Yamada...
but I see you in a new light now, kid!

159
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:41,440
You should resist
 for a bit, Yamada...
Hey, Yamada! Come on!

160
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,810
Oh, I've never seen you before.

161
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,560
Which high school are you from?

162
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,640
Ah, no... I'm a college student...

163
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:48,820
An older girl?!

164
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,690
An older girl?!
Too close...

165
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,090
- An older girl...?

166
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,060
- An older girl...?
- I get it! So you like older girls, eh!

167
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,380
Attaboy!

168
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:58,720
You're making me proud!

169
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,730
- He's one unique

170
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,900
- Well, never expected that Yamada
- sports-oriented teacher, I see...

171
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,250
- to be that type!
- sports-oriented teacher, I see...

172
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:03,320
- to be that type!
- sports-oriented teacher, I see...
She's at
a loss for
 words too

173
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,020
She's at
a loss for
 words too
- That very Yamada!
- He's a P.E. teacher.

174
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,590
She's at
a loss for
 words too

175
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:10,460
Yamada!

176
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,550
Is she your girlfriend?!

177
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,600
Since when?!
Cheep Cheep Cheep

178
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,340
Cheep Cheep Cheep
Who's she?!

179
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,230
Cheep Cheep Cheep
So you like older girls?!

180
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,390
Cheep Cheep Cheep
Who are they?

181
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,940
Cheep Cheep Cheep
Must be the first year.

182
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,300
Cheep Cheep Cheep
Looking at their shoes' colour.

183
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,080
Cheep Cheep Cheep
Being young sure is great.

184
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,690
Cheep Cheep Cheep

185
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,610
Um, I'm not his girlfriend.

186
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,030
So you two aren't going out!

187
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:33,950
Really?

188
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,960
Then why are you two
walking together?

189
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,760
Why, Yamada?!

190
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,900
Who's that girl?!

191
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,380
- So it's a lie that you like older girls?!

192
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,020
- What are you doing with her?
- So it's a lie that you like older girls?!

193
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,200
- What are you doing with her?

194
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:50,130
Tired...
This Woman Has Been Interrogated
by Many Girls along the Way
We could finally get out of the building...

195
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:50,900
Tired...
This Woman Has Been Interrogated
by Many Girls along the Way

196
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,960
Tired...
This Woman Has Been Interrogated
by Many Girls along the Way
I'm so beat now...

197
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,720
Tired...
This Woman Has Been Interrogated
by Many Girls along the Way

198
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,320
Hey!

199
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,970
Oh, Akito's here too!

200
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,270
We've bought a lot of stuff!

201
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,480
Runa's got a stomachache again?

202
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,470
Wait, you got wrinkles now, Akane?

203
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,330
Listen to me! We were having it rough
until we got outside!

204
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:14,810
- We've got the t-shirt Runa wanted!

205
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,720
- We've got the t-shirt Runa wanted!
- People must be in a fuss

206
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,670
- We've got the t-shirt Runa wanted!
- that Yamada brought a girl, right?

207
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,630
- Also, she wants the cheesedog,
- Runa faced the same fate last year.

208
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,000
-  and the takoyaki, and then...
- It's beyond imagination!

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,750
-  and the takoyaki, and then...
- I can't stand the staring!

210
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,250
Not to mention, I'm not his girlfriend,
so I didn't know what to do...

211
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,370
Not to mention, I'm not his girlfriend,
so I didn't know what to do...
What was i
supposed to do?

212
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:27,610
Not to mention, I'm not his girlfriend,
so I didn't know what to do...
What was i
supposed to do?
Heheheh

213
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,000
What was i
supposed to do?
Heheheh
I'd love to see you crush

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,080
Heheheh
I'd love to see you crush

215
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,340
Heheheh
the girls' hope as you walk, though.

216
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,380
Heheheh
No, I'm telling you!
They're getting the wrong idea!

217
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,720
No, I'm telling you!
They're getting the wrong idea!

218
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,150
Well, they're already glaring at you,
and you two already look like it, so...

219
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,520
Why don't you both hook up?

220
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,400
You two already look like it,
so why don't you both hook up?

221
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,880
Right, Akito?

222
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:01,620
Well... Yeah...

223
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,710
Huh?!

224
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:05,400
Akane's a bright girl, so it's fine...

225
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,070
What are you...

226
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,910
Right...

227
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,030
MMO's her hobby,
and you complement each other!

228
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,830
Hey! What are you blabbering about?!

229
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,500
All right!
You're officially a couple now!

230
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,630
Kidding!

231
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,850
Akane...?

232
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,210
S-Sorry...

233
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,510
It was just a joke...

234
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,980
Sorry, sorry!
Still Can't Process

I was just teasing Akito!

He's Aware That It Was a Joke

My bad.

240
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,210
I need to buy Runa's orders!

241
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:51,960
Akane!

242
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,710
Akane!

243
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,630
I hate you, Eita!

244
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,810
You don't tease me too, okay, Yamada!

245
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,490
Dang it!

246
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,830
Oh, shoot... I meant to bully Akito,
but it hit Akane too...

247
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,980
You two wait here.
I'll go apologise...

248
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,510
What I was supposed to say there...

249
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,010
You two already look like it,
so why don’t you both hook up?

250
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,170
Okay, enough with the jokes.

251
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,310
I should've said that instead!

252
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,770
And yet...

253
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:01,040
Why did I have to react
so incomprehensibly?!

254
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,640
Yamada had a really blank face earlier.

255
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,040
It's so embarrassing!

256
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,290
Retro Cafe

257
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,790
Retro Cafe

258
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,920
S-Sorry!

259
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:12,930
S-Sorry!
Stare...

260
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,790
Stare...

261
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,540
Please walk slowly in the corridor.

262
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,070
Yamada?!

263
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,910
Hey! Don't run!

264
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,560
Hey, is that your companion, Yamada...

265
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,940
Akane.

266
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,060
Please stop for a bit.

267
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,410
It's dangerous to run on the stairs.

268
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,140
Don't make her run, okay?

269
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,100
Sorry about earlier.

270
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,560
My name...

271
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,810
You called it for the first time!

272
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,440
Huh? No, that shouldn't be...

273
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,240
It is your first time, for real!

274
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,950
Huh?

275
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,310
I mean, you rarely call me,

276
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,700
so I thought of a theory that
you might actually not know my name!

277
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,580
so I thought of a theory that
you might actually not know my name!
I know

278
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,950
I know
It was inside my mind!

279
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:30,120
I know
It was inside my mind!
As an
 influential theory!

280
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,410
I know
As an
 influential theory!
Such a dumb thing...

281
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,760
So, uh... about earlier...

282
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,560
Who's that?

283
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,430
Come over here!

284
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,140
Sorry for taking you
to a secluded place.

285
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,690
I can't stand the murderous intent
behind my back...

286
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,440
Is there really such a thing?

287
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,330
All right,
no one's around...

288
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:00,560
All right,
no one's around...
Sorry about earlier.

289
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,400
Sorry about earlier.

290
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,030
I didn't mean to tease you.

291
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,670
I thought Eita
was cracking another joke,

292
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,470
so I just...

293
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,790
H-Hang on!

294
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,780
I'm not really mad,
so let's stop talking about this!

295
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,830
Huh?

296
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,000
You're not mad?

297
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,310
But you were clearly mad earlier...

298
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:25,210
No, I wasn't! Honest!

299
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,720
Anyway...

300
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,600
It was just a bit embarrassing...

301
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,760
So I just...

302
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,130
So I just...
Sorry...

303
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,150
Sorry...

304
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,980
Sorry...
Said that...

305
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:44,050
Huh? Excuse me,
but which part of it was embarrassing?

306
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:46,370
Could you not ask further about that?

307
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,500
So, you're really not mad?

308
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,300
I told you, I'm not.

309
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,430
That's great, then.

310
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,329
All right, let's go buy some food.

311
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,220
If...

312
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,050
If I took Eita's joke at face value,

313
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,369
and said I'd go out with you...

314
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,960
If that's the case...

315
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,430
Yamada...

316
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,580
What would you do?

317
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,520
K-Kidding!

318
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,070
There might be some girls
who'd take that at face value,

319
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:12,440
so you shouldn't turn
romance into a joke!

320
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,750
Got it?

321
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,290
Yes...

322
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,500
All right, off we go!

323
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,160
There's something wrong
with me today...!

324
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,900
If that's the case,
then I think it'd be a great honour.

325
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,430
But, for a boring guy like me,

326
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,900
you're just like a flower on a high peak,

327
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,260
so I've never really
given a thought about it.

328
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,070
Flower on
 a high peak

329
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,140
Flower on
 a high peak
Yamada!

330
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,260
Huh? You seriously saying that?

331
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,590
It's kind of interesting,
 though...

332
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,860
It's kind of interesting,
 though...
Yes...

333
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,990
So you thought of me that way?

334
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,390
Yes.

335
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,450
What are we buying, again?

336
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,640
Wait for me!

337
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,140
Crepe, cheesedog, takoyaki,
and miso pork soup.

338
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,540
Also, you're quite
an interesting guy, Yamada.

339
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,290
For real?

340
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,000
Please join the beauty
pageant this year, Yamada!

341
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,900
No, I can't...

342
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,560
Come on, help your friends out!

343
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,870
I mean, look at the crowd outside!

344
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:10,620
Okay?!

345
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,290
Nope.

346
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,790
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
Please! This is our last festival, right?!

347
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:17,230
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
I want to make the best
memories in our final festival!

348
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:18,670
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
- Yeah! This is our last one!

349
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,830
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
- Yeah! This is our last one!
- His handsome face is also

350
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,050
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
- Yeah! This is our last one!
- the cause of annoyance.

351
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:24,030
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
And he's also good at games.
What a cheat.

352
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,180
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
I beg you!

353
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,620
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
Come on!

354
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,390
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
1 Day  until  the
 Tosei Festival
Please!

355
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,820
Maybe we should stop them now.

356
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,230
What do I do with him...

357
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:37,130
I'm in!

358
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:37,990
Huh?!

359
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,240
Okamoto, what are you...

360
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,740
Just leave it to me!

361
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,870
The Day of Tosei Festival

362
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,550
Tosei Festival Male Beauty Pageant
It's finally time for the main show!

363
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:56,160
Tosei Festival Male Beauty Pageant
The man who resigned from
the beauty pageant twice in two years,

364
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,630
Tosei Festival Male Beauty Pageant
has finally made an appearance!

365
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:58,910
has finally made an appearance!

366
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,530
Entry number 6,

367
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,020
Class 3-A, Akito Yamada!

368
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,960
Or rather, his substitute,

369
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,960
the pinch-hitting Okamoto.

370
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,780
Play ball!

371
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,990
Where's Yamada?!

372
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,140
Get off the stage, Okamoto!

373
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,800
We don't want you!

374
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,240
Okay, so I love hamburgers and potatoes.

375
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,680
I hate campers in the corner with a shotgun.

376
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,700
Takeaki Okamoto here!

377
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,810
Vote for me, okay!

378
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,750
Looking good, Okamoto!

379
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,410
Go for it, Okamoto!

380
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,770
What are you blabbering about?!

381
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,510
- Give us Yamada!

382
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,080
- Give us Yamada!
- Go, Okamoto!

383
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,730
Liven up the stage for Yamada!

384
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,700
What's a camper?!

385
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,540
Please respect the supporter rules...

386
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,880
You should at least treat him
to a hamburger later.

387
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,780
Right.

388
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,710
Let your big bro have some too.

389
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,110
I'm so hungry...

390
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,910
Only a spoonful is enough! Ahn...

391
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,870
Eww.

392
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,980
It seems to be
 lively out there...
