00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,650
Hey! Miss Paladin with
worn-down clothes over there!

00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,110
Street Stall

3
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,290
Street Stall
Want me to fix your getup?
I'll do a beginner's discount for you!

4
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:19,670
Want me to fix your getup?
I'll do a beginner's discount for you!

5
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:21,650
Street Stall

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:24,500
Street Stall
I'm Rurihime.
Nice to meet you, Miss Paladin!

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,110
I'm Rurihime.
Nice to meet you, Miss Paladin!

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,640
There's something I want to talk about.
Is that okay?

9
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:03,390
I  Like  You

10
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,350
I  Like  You
Where am I?!

11
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,730
I  Like  You
Well, didn't expect that.

12
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,190
I thought you were gonna
confess your love to me.

13
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,610
Sorry. Did it look that way to you?

14
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,680
It only looked that way to me.

15
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,200
Apologies, Sir...

16
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,660
So, what is it about?

17
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,200
Well...

18
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,210
10 Minutes Later

19
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,330
Akane's got a crush on someone!

20
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,130
Wow, that's new! Congrats!
Shortening of Time

21
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,710
Should I guess who it is?

22
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,720
Don't say it...

23
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,640
This is quite deep.

24
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,300
Street Stall

25
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,720
Street Stall
Back when we first met,

26
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,410
Street Stall
you were just wandering about
aimlessly alone in-game.

27
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:44,870
Street Stall

28
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,980
Street Stall
Looking back, now I know back then
you got dumped and went downhill,

29
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,900
Looking back, now I know back then
you got dumped and went downhill,

30
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:52,780
but you actually got back up. Attagirl.

31
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,370
But she's still hesitantly finding out
why she got dumped!

32
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,280
Huh? Now that's so pessimistic of you.

33
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,140
Uh... It might sound that way to you,

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,750
but I just wanted to know
where I messed up.

35
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,550
I think it's pretty
optimistic in my own way.

36
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,550
So...

37
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,970
It's just...

38
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,810
Whenever I see you, Eita...

39
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,890
I want to talk to Rurihime too.

40
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,770
It's Rurihime and Momo who comforted me
during my darkest times, after all.

41
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,730
I wanted to tell you two
that I've got a crush on someone.

42
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,030
Yeah.

43
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:44,720
I've known your crush
since long ago, he's a good guy.

44
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,920
Some people might judge him for his looks,
but a nice guy like him is few and far between.

45
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,670
Well, I guess you know already, but...

46
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,510
It's the truth.

47
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,680
He's slow-witted,
but highly tolerant.

48
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,730
So just be yourself.

49
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,470
You can never be too straight with him.

50
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,570
Good luck! Me and Momo
will be here if you get rejected!

51
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,400
He's right, Akane.
Women are all about guts! Act to your resolve!

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,620
Then, you should just confess
to him right now!

53
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,030
Yep, yep!

54
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,510
G-Got it. I'll go for broke!

55
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,779
Please don't actually go broke.

56
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,930
I'll try my best not to.

57
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,220
Thanks, guys! I love you!

58
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,970
I hope she doesn't get broke.

59
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,670
I hope she doesn't get broke.
It'll be a
 hassle later...

60
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,140
It'll be a
 hassle later...
I wonder about that.

61
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,700
Oh, right. Let me introduce myself.
I'm Momoko Maeda.

62
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,020
I'm Eita Sasaki.

63
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,070
I'm a 20 year-old college student,
seriously in search of a marriage partner.

64
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,460
I'm a 20 year-old college student,
seriously in search of a marriage partner.
Huh...

65
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,330
Huh...

66
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,400
Huh...
You got a girlfriend yet?

67
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,520
You got a girlfriend yet?

68
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,150
Huh?

69
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,830
When did I start liking him?

70
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,510
I can't remember when I try to.

71
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,480
Still, he who rarely smiles,

72
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,840
would put me to smile when he did.

73
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,520
It's so packed...
It's so packed...

74
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,930
It's so packed...
It's so packed...
And he pretends not to notice,

75
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,760
It's so packed...
It's so packed...
telling that we're just friends...

76
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,550
telling that we're just friends...

77
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,550
Try as much as we wanted to fool myself,

78
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,740
it didn't seem to have any point.

79
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,060
Oh, sorry.

80
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,870
I'm jumping the gun too much...

81
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,280
You okay?

82
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:49,290
I'm okay now.

83
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,200
Yes?

84
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:09,810
Oh?

85
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,870
Y-Yo.

86
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,580
'Sup.

87
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,450
Umm... You need something?

88
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,400
Actually, there's something

89
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,680
- Oh, Kato's grandpa! You taking a walk now?
- must talk with you today...

90
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,830
- Huh?
- So, um...

91
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,620
You taking a walk now?!

92
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,330
- Huh? Hello!

93
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,540
- Um...
- Huh? Hello!

94
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,450
- Hey! The weather!

95
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,250
- Today...
- Hey! The weather!

96
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,010
- Today...
- It's so warm today!

97
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,170
- I wish it were warm like today every day!

98
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:52,450
- Um...
- I wish it were warm like today every day!

99
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,860
It really is warm...

100
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,520
Akane.

101
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,380
- By the way, I saw your grandkid Emi
- Yes?

102
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,050
- By the way, I saw your grandkid Emi
- Sorry, I gotta rush to my cram school now.

103
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,880
- by the station the other day!
- Really? Sorry, I thought

104
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,830
- by the station the other day!
- you didn't have school since it's Saturday.

105
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,420
- Huh?
- you didn't have school since it's Saturday.

106
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,160
- Can you hear me?
- you didn't have school since it's Saturday.

107
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,380
- Huh?
- If you don't mind,

108
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,570
- Emi!
- If you don't mind,

109
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,030
- Emi!
- can we talk while walking to the station?

110
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,630
- can we talk while walking to the station?

111
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,660
- Oh, yeah...
- She's your grandkid, right?

112
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,490
- She's your grandkid, right?

113
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,510
Is it something you can't talk
over the phone?

114
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,020
Silly me... He has his own schedule,
and yet...

115
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,800
I didn't even consider it.

116
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,210
Sorry, I'll just come back some...

117
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,810
Emi said she's joining a band!

118
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,870
I'll go get changed in a bit, so just wait.

119
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,090
Y-Yeah.

120
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,490
Sorry for taking the time
out of your busy schedule.

121
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,290
That was surprising...

122
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,120
By the way, is your cold gone already?

123
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,420
Yeah, thanks to you.

124
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,130
Oh, yeah, I gotta...

125
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,880
Let's face this way.

126
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,430
Thanks for waiting.

127
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,930
So, what is it?

128
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,430
Sorry, I was thinking
of how to break the ice...

129
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,810
I didn't imagine we'd
go out to the city

130
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,060
I didn't imagine we'd
go out to the city
Clock's ticking...

131
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,940
Clock's ticking...

132
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,460
Need to tell him quickly.
That's why I'm here.

133
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,250
But...

134
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,960
With all the commotion around him,

135
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,330
I didn't really have to force my way
to talk to him in the city...

136
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,700
There's another chance.

137
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,950
When he's available...

138
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:37,710
Akane!

139
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,570
It's still red.

140
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,860
My bad...

141
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,190
You okay?

142
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,300
Your absent-mindedness
is off the charts today.

143
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,930
No good... My focus...

144
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,010
Sorry.

145
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,120
Buy as much time as I want for this,

146
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,520
I'll only trouble him more and more.

147
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,940
I should retry later.

148
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,690
Maybe I should just...

149
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,190
It's green now.

150
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,990
Maybe I should indulge myself in his kindness,

151
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,990
without any unneeded words to say.

152
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,900
As I kept my feelings hidden...

153
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,240
That's kind of cheating.

154
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,520
This is my station.

155
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,320
Yeah.

156
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,790
Sorry I couldn't listen
to what you had to say in the end.

157
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,350
I was running late,
so I kind of rushed it.

158
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,460
It's okay, I was acting too strange too.

159
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,400
Right you were.

160
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:45,890
Right you were.
It's dangerous to
 ignore the traffic lights

161
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,360
It's dangerous to
 ignore the traffic lights

162
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,480
Well, see you later.

163
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,090
Sure.

164
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,310
Is it important to you?

165
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,010
I can make some time after I'm done,
though it'll be late in the night.

166
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,250
But if you're okay with it, I can call you.

167
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,290
If you really want to talk today.

168
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,690
You sure? Won't you get tired?

169
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,960
All I have to do is listen to you,
so no big deal.

170
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,220
Though, I'm not really sure
if I could be a good listener.

171
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,290
Though, I'm not really sure
if I could be a good listener.
Imagination
machine

172
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:14,970
Imagination
machine

173
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,080
Sweet!

174
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,060
I'll be going now, then!

175
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,070
All right!
Good luck with your cram school!

176
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,070
Bye-bye

177
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,710
It's suddenly raining out of the blue.

178
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,460
It was all sunny just now.

179
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,340
That's all for today.

180
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,850
Be sure to do the exercises
in the textbook, everyone.

181
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,620
It's pouring outside...

182
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,360
What do we do now, Yamada?

183
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,230
I've got a folding umbrella.

184
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:07,440
I've got a folding umbrella.
I saw the forecast

185
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,480
I saw the forecast
My Hero!

186
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:08,770
Take me to
the station

187
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,430
Take me to
the station
Wanna share it with me?

188
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:10,480
Take me to
the station
Sure.

189
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,110
Take me to
the station
Sure.
What do
 I do with you?

190
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:11,240
Sure.
What do
 I do with you?

191
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,860
What do
 I do with you?

192
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,740
Will you be okay, Class Rep?

193
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,360
I didn't bring my umbrella,
so I'll just run back home.

194
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,300
I didn't bring my umbrella,
so I'll just run back home.
I'll be jumping from under
one roof to another

195
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,910
I'll be jumping from under
one roof to another
You're being way too strong-willed.

196
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:18,990
You're being way too strong-willed.

197
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,370
Oh, well.

198
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,950
I'll give the Yamada umbrella
ticket to you, Class Rep.

199
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,980
Can I, Yamada?

200
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,670
I don't care either way.

201
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,380
I can't have that.
You two should just go home together.

202
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,650
No way we're leaving
a lady alone in this weather.

203
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,670
Anyway, this is a golden chance for you to go
home together with him, so grab it while you can.

204
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,790
Don't be so considerate to me
in a weird way like that.

205
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,640
Yamada'll think weirdly of this.

206
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:47,900
Nothing will start when he's not
at least thinking weirdly of you, right?

207
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,480
Especially when it comes to you.

208
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:56,820
I guess they'll just keep
on pushing it to each other...

209
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:01,120
Maybe I should just give my umbrella
to them and sprint home...

210
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,640
Maybe I should just give my umbrella
to them and sprint home...
I wanna
 go home...

211
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,650
I wanna
 go home...

212
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,620
I wanna
 go home...
Yamada.

213
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:04,740
Yamada.

214
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,330
Um...

215
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:09,770
Can I...

216
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,340
...ask you to share your umbrella with me?

217
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,450
So, I tried the new game the other day.

218
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,250
It's still in beta,
so there's a lot of bugs,

219
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:22,600
but it shows promise.

220
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,970
Come on!

221
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,410
Wait up!

222
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,480
You're too slow, Saki!

223
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,230
I'll slip if I go too fast.

224
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,110
Gosh...

225
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,990
You know them?

226
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:39,850
Huh?

227
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:44,490
I mean, you kept staring
at the running girl just now.

228
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,280
No.

229
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,110
Tsubaki, you should just
use it by yourself.

230
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,270
But why?

231
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,980
It'll be pointless if you get drenched,
so go ahead.

232
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,590
But what about you?

233
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,710
I'll just sprint.

234
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,710
- My station's just over there.
- But...

235
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,510
- My station's just over there.
- Um...

236
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,460
Wait...

237
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,120
Hold up!

238
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,750
Stop!

239
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Wait for me, Yamada!

240
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,730
Please!

241
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,610
Sorry...

242
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,220
My glasses...

243
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,410
It's all blurry...

244
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,380
It's cracked...

245
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,550
You okay?

246
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:32,410
I like you.

247
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,640
Hm?

248
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,290
I like you...

249
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,290
Sorry for troubling you.

250
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,650
But... Please.

251
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,820
Just for today...

252
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,390
I want you...

253
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:26,770
...to only think about me.

254
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,270
Just for today.

255
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,550
I couldn't make some time in the end.
Let's hear it some other time, sorry.
Akito Yamada

256
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,990
It was raining too hard last night...

257
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,180
I kept getting up
to the noisy noise of the rain.

258
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,240
Then, I couldn't shut my eyes again after that...

259
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,610
Then, I couldn't shut my eyes again after that...
I gamed for
a bit, though

260
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,620
I gamed for
a bit, though
Your mind's already somewhere else now, isn't it?

261
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,990
Your mind's already somewhere else now, isn't it?

262
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,470
Yep, touche!

263
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,750
Studying hard as usual, I see!

264
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,370
I brought some doughnuts,
so help yourselves!

265
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:23,880
Yay!

266
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,790
Thank you for tutoring her, even though
you'll be taking an exam too, Yamada.

267
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:32,050
Runa won't want to study
with any other tutor than you.

268
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,260
She must like you a lot.

269
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,630
Anyway, looking at you like this,
you really are made for each other!

270
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:38,690
Right, Big Bro?

271
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,990
Right, Big Bro?
Want him as my son
Genius
Want him as my son
Good conduct
Want him as my son
Handsome
Want him as my son

272
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,290
Want him as my son
Genius
Want him as my son
Good conduct
Want him as my son
Handsome
Want him as my son
Oh, my, Mama!

273
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,900
Want him as my son
Genius
Want him as my son
Good conduct
Want him as my son
Handsome
Want him as my son
I can see through your ambitions!

274
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,210
What do you mean?

275
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,150
Dunno.

276
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,610
I'm just saying that
they're made for each other.

277
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,150
- Right, right?

278
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:49,370
- Right, right?
Ambition?

279
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,230
Ambition?
- You can tell what they're saying?
- Right, right?

280
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:51,530
Ambition?
Dunno.

281
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,500
Ambition?
Dunno.
These Two Have No Idea What It's About

282
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,030
Ambition?
These Two Have No Idea What It's About
Probably some kind of joke?

283
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,290
Anyway, Akito. Yesterday...

284
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,670
A girl confessed to you, right?

285
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:01,290
Huh?

286
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,040
Huh?
Hey, the answer
doesn't match

287
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,540
How do you know?

288
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,020
How do you know?
Consider it
an honour

289
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,800
Consider it
an honour
I know everything.

290
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,230
I know everything.

291
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,819
So Akane did confess, huh?

292
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,430
Way to go.

293
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:10,690
Let me see

294
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,180
Let me see
So? What did you say?

295
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,710
Let me see
What does it matter?

296
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,060
Let me see
Oh, it does.

297
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,569
Oh, it does.

298
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:16,560
Does it?

299
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:19,560
I'm still thinking about it.

300
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:23,010
Oh, just like that?

301
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:26,170
I thought for sure
you'd be okay with it.

302
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,000
Huh...

303
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,380
I mean, you get along well.

304
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,320
Well...

305
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,450
You're so indecisive.

306
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,620
You're so indecisive.
It's no use thinking
about it for too long

307
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,250
It's no use thinking
about it for too long

308
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,530
It's no use thinking
about it for too long
You gotta answer to her feelings,
quickly and clearly.

309
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,330
You gotta answer to her feelings,
quickly and clearly.

310
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:38,830
Don't give her hope and play with her heart,
that's the worst thing you can do.

311
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,620
I won't do that.

312
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,290
Stupid Eita made Yamada angry again.

313
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,560
Stupid Eita made Yamada angry again.
He he heh

314
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:46,750
He he heh
Huh?!

315
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,380
Huh?!

316
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:50,070
Sorry, Akito! Please don't be mad!
I'll give you doughnuts!

317
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,000
It's MY doughnuts!

318
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:58,140
The number you are calling
cannot be reached...

319
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,290
Fes from Summer
Canned
Chicken
Curry
Canned
Chicken
Curry

320
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:01,020
Fes from Summer
Canned

Canned
Chicken
Curry
Oh?

321
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,650
Akane, Akane!

322
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,400
Look outside!

323
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,650
Hey, Yamada!

324
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,590
Fancy seeing you in our store.

325
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,360
Don't you have work?

326
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,390
I asked for the outside cleaning work.

327
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,590
Did you come here to see me, by chance?

328
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,740
Kidding.

329
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,370
I did.

330
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,040
Huh?

331
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:26,330
I called you earlier,
but you didn't pick up.

332
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,700
Really? Sorry about that.

333
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,670
I left home with only 3% on my battery.

334
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:32,360
I left home with only 3% on my battery.
Maybe it was
already out of juice...

335
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,180
Maybe it was
already out of juice...
It's okay.

336
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:38,140
I just thought I'd apologise about yesterday
if I could see you in person.

337
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,490
Really?

338
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,690
I don't mind it.

339
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,190
It's nothing important.

340
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,760
So, I had Momo listen to me yesterday.

341
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,440
I felt so relieved after that.

342
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,450
Putting that aside...

343
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,390
You don't seem too lively today.
What happened?

344
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,670
I don't? I feel normal, though.

345
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,920
Huh? You really don't!
You don't sound cheerful today!

346
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,370
Wait, you usually don't, anyway.

347
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,950
Also, you don't speak a lot today.

348
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,840
Wait, you usually don't speak a lot.

349
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,840
Here's the usual you,
and here's the today you.

350
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Can't tell
the difference

351
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,090
Can't tell
the difference
But that's
 something

352
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:14,840
But that's
 something

353
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,530
Maybe I'm just tired
from getting too busy these days...

354
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,370
I can't tell, though.

355
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,850
Maybe he's tired from the cram school?

356
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,360
That's a problem I can't even relate to,

357
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,170
That's a problem I can't even relate to,
In terms
of score

358
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,360
In terms
of score
but it must be tough.

359
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,530
but it must be tough.

360
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,730
I see.

361
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,780
Oh, yeah! My gear in FOS
just got upgraded these days.

362
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,210
I've been wanting to brag this to you,

363
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,770
but you never logged in.

364
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,020
I changed my sword into a nice one.

365
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,530
What kind?

366
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,250
What, you ask?

367
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,550
What do you mean?

368
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,050
I mean, what rank,
or what type the sword is...

369
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:55,500
I mean, what rank,
or what type the sword is...
And the
reality...

370
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,830
And the
reality...

371
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,300
And the
reality...
So...

372
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,290
Give me your hand.

373
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,720
Is that oil-based?

374
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,020
Give me your hand.

375
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:07,190
Bosses really drop a lot of nice things.

376
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,500
It's got some accessories,
 like this... so cute, right?

377
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,710
It's got some accessories,
 like this... so cute, right?
Now I know why you

378
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,630
It's got some accessories,
 like this... so cute, right?
keep farming bosses every time.

379
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,770
It's got some accessories,
 like this... so cute, right?
Well, the drop percentages are low, though.

380
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:14,670
It's got some accessories,
 like this... so cute, right?
Yep, yep.

381
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,200
It's got some accessories,
 like this... so cute, right?
That's why it makes one tremble in joy
when a rare drop item spawns.

382
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:24,050
I don't really get it, but cheer up.

383
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:27,450
Just be the usual emotionally
detached Yamada.

384
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,790
Let me draw my
avatar on your hand

385
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,420
Let me draw my
avatar on your hand
What does the
 outfit look
 like, again?

386
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,170
So it looks that way to you.

387
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,520
The reason I don't talk a lot...

388
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,180
...is that I'm afraid
to hurt someone with my words.

389
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,580
I can't read deep into someone's mind,

390
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,330
and most of the time,
I can't tell a joke from someone.

391
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,370
I think I'm just someone...

392
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,370
...who's so boring.

393
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,700
You see...

394
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,530
Sometimes, you give some
sharp comments on my words...

395
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,200
I, uh...

396
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,150
I quite like that, and even when
you're just silent among the others,

397
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:15,670
you're being considerate to them.

398
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:19,740
I know you always try
to help someone in need.

399
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,720
I mean, you've helped me a lot, too.

400
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,470
You're not boring at all.

401
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,220
Didn't I say that you're interesting?

402
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,430
You can count on that.
It's the truth.

403
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:32,610
Okay?

404
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:07,390
Waking up in the morning, and sighing...

405
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,950
One day, it's all become a habit of mine.

406
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,080
I guess love is...

407
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,810
Yukari, where are you going this late?

408
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,740
I want to meet up with my friend.

409
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,390
Be sure to go back
as soon as you're done.

410
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:27,010
Yeah.

411
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,340
It was supposed...

412
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,080
...to be something more fun.
