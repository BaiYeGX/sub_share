00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,780
Sorry, Akane.

2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,260
There's someone else I like.

3
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,680
Hmm... Well...

4
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,610
I'd been wondering why he was
so cold to me these days...

5
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,990
This Is Why I've Had Enough with Gamer Boys!!

6
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,700
Your BF was taken by someone else
from an MMO game?!

7
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,820
Now that's a scoop! Wow!

8
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,720
My main ma'am Momo,
you're ringing my ears.

9
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,950
Anyway...

10
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,440
The game was something you guys
played together on PC, right?

11
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,580
Yep...

12
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,460
Wow... Something like that can
even happen in a game, huh...

13
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,540
Akane.

14
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,080
You should play this game, too.

15
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,950
Wow, what's this?

16
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,900
It's the new MMO!

17
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,300
I thought he was a bit of a gamer,

18
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,600
but I never expected him to cheat
with another girl from that game...

19
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:45,650
but I never expected him to cheat
with another girl from that game...
Ah, okay.

I'm at a loss of words.

67

It was a good call
you broke up with him.

68
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,750
I'm sure you're still feeling
disappointed now, though...

69
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,700
But I've got a lecture this afternoon,
so I'm going now.

70

Stop feeling gloomy forever
and come to class, okay?

71
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,760
You'll keep feeling blue
if you shut yourself in.

72
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,490
Well, yeah...

73
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,710
It's not like I'll die if I got dumped,

74
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,540
so my life still continues,
and I can't skip college too much.

75
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,190
I want to work part-time too.

76

Oh, I forgot he was this kind of guy.

108
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,560
He left a bit of a bad impression

Not to mention, he sounds like

No, I'm not.

118
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,500
I just got dumped by my BF yesterday and got
so pissed, so I was just hunting to vent.

119
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,810
Also, listen to this! He cheated on me
because of this game, too!

120

124
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,390

Oh, really?
could you give this hunting ground to me?

125
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,650
So you don't want to
converse with me, eh?

126
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,150
Not a chance!

127
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,300
I got here first, so you should refrain
from asking such a thing since you came later.

128
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,410
I heard it's the manners in a hunting ground.

129
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,660
I heard it's the manners in a hunting ground.
Polite Words with Enough Anger

130
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,410
I may not be interested at all,

131
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,030
but I'll use this hunting ground to vent.

132
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,670
Just go find the rare item
on another channel.

133
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,960
I will never give you this place!

134
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,130
I may not be interested at all,
Just go find the rare item on another channel.
I will never give you this place!
but I'll use this hunting ground to vent.

135
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,550
Just go find the rare item on another channel.
I may not be interested at all,
but I'll use this hunting ground to vent.
I will never give you this place!

136
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,930
Oh, no! I ranted to the stranger
Yamada out of anger...

137
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,180
Well, yeah...

138
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,060
I guess...

139
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,440
Yamada
I'm not interested

140
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,130
I hate you, Yamada!
I'll just log out after you're gone!

141
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,950
This is why I've had enough
with gamer boys!!

Wow, it's pretty close, too...

147
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,560
Akane, let's be together forever.

148
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,410
Yeah!

149
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,230
Sorry...

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,900
I have someone else I like...
in that game...

151
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,420
She said she likes me too...

152
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,970
I'm really sorry...

153
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,200
He must already be going out
with her anyway...

154
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,270
Will they be going there together?

155
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,350
Dang...

156
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,730
Like hell I'd let it end
with him dumping me!

157
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,180
Akane!

158
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,400
You're finally here!
You back on your feet already?

159
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,790
Momo.

160
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,740
Hey, Momo, would you tag along with me
to buy some clothes and shoes?

161
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,640
Hm? You going somewhere?

162
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,860
I'm going to an event.

163
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,020
He might be coming there too.

164
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,900
I'll make him regret dumping me,
who has become the utmost beauty now.

165
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,260
Wow, she's not back on her feet at all!

166
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,510
It couldn't be that game's event, could it?

167
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,270
Of course it is that game's event.

168
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,520
He'll most likely go there.

169
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,120
Now that's tough.

170
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,980
Whatever you say.

171
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,400
Wow...

172
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,370
- Please make me cuter!
- I'll definitely make him regret...

173
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,430
- Okay!
- I'll definitely make him regret...

174
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,150
- ...choosing a girl in a game over me!

175
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,550
- Please make me thinner!
- ...choosing a girl in a game over me!

176
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,050
- I'll definitely make him regret dumping me!
- Please make me thinner!

177
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,180
- Okay!
- I'll definitely make him regret dumping me!

178
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,520
- I'll definitely make him regret dumping me!

179
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:21,390

183
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:29,220
Original Exhibiton
 and Sale
This is surprisingly quite grand...
...will expire by the end of December!

184
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,700
And there's a lot of people
here too than I expected...

185
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,860
Hang on... Could it be that I...

186
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,730
I'm actually gonna go
bankrupt this month?

187
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,800
Still, everyone here plays
the same game as me, huh...

188
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,680
There's a lot more men here
for some reason...

189
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,720
But it just feels so strange.

190
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,110
What kind of character
is everyone running?

191
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,370
Takuma!

192
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,120
Takuma...

193
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,870
Ta...

194
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,740
Let's go to the front?

195
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,640
Sure.

196
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,000
W-Wait!

197
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,350
What happened?

198
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,810
Oww...

199
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,390
A girl just tripped?

200
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,700
This is just too dumb...

201
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,410
I want to disappear...

202
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,710
I just... want to cry now...

203
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,220
You okay?

204
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,380
Wow! A hot dude!

205
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,500
Yes, I'm okay!

206
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,200
Did I hit you, by chance?

207
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,990
Yes...

208
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,310
I'm sorry!
I was so deep in my thoughts...

209
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,260
I just had a bad day...

210
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,140
...and couldn't see around me...

211
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:09,640
Oh, really?

212
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,910
I'm sorry, it's nothing.

213
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,390
Huh...

214
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:19,800
Well... I'm not interested.

215
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,690
Huh? Hang on...

216
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,730
I thought I'd heard that before...

217
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,750
I'm not interested

218
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,760
Yamada?

219
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,760
Are you the Afro Yamada?

220
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,520
Who are you?

221
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,020
My Love Story with
Yamada at Lv999

222
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,420
Who are you?

223
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,650
Umm... Err...

224
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,150
Huh?

225
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,180
Now that's a shallow reaction...

226
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,530
But he's really got that déjà vu feeling
of the Afro Yamada, or is it just me?

227
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,410
There can't be such coincidence, can there?

228
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:08,170
And he's looking at me so suspiciously...

229
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,180
So he's not that Yamada?!

230
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,060
I'm sorry...

231
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,410
Huh?!

232
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,360
Takuma, and his new girlfriend...

233
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,340
Why are you here...?

234
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:23,450
T-Takuma! Wow, fancy seeing you here!

235
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,090
If it isn't you, Yamada!

236
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:25,810
Huh?

237
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,100
Whoa! You're Yamada, aren't you?!

238
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,830
Who?

239
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,820
You don't know?
He's a really famous pro gamer!

240
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,770
Oh, that's amazing!

241
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,470
He really is!
Hey, are you playing FOS too, Yamada?

242
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,290
I'm a big fan of yours!

243
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,930
I always watch your live streams!
So cool!

244
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,910
Wowzer!!

245
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,540
Are you famous?

246
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,710
Well... locally.

247
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,210
Fancy seeing you here, Takuma!

248
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,570
Are you on a date too?

249
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,830
Oh, it's you, Akane.

250
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:01,640
You're here?

251
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,100
I was always here!

252
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,410
What are you doing here?

253
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:12,240
I also play that game,
so it won't be strange if I come, right?

254
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,610
Huh?

255
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,700
By yourself?

256
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:17,860
Like hell!

257
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,510
Let me introduce you
to my new boyfriend...

258
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,610
No, I'm not.

259
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,070
I beg you... Could you please
take pity on me and play along?

260
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,700
Are you for real?

261
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,570
Just consider it
as an act of helping someone...

262
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,500
Huh...

263
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,510
Let me give you this ticket
I got from being a visitor.

264
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,170
You can have this...
Visitor's Benefit for the 1st Anniversary Event
The Prophet's Stone
The Prophet's Stone

265
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,550
For real? This is the PIN code
for the Prophet's Stone, you know?

266
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,300
A super rare enhancing stone, you know?

267
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,310
So that's what it is...

268
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,060
I am...

269
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,520
He's my boyfriend!

270
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,540
For real...?

271
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,490
I've always followed him for three months,
yet he never followed back or responded...

272
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:02,640
I've always followed him for three months,
yet he never followed back or responded...
I always
replied on
 his tweets
too...

273
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,780
I always
replied on
 his tweets
too...

274
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,430
This is frustrating!

275
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,780
Takuma!

276
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,940
I won!

277
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,930
This is a bit different from what I imagined,
but he's frustrated!

278
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,290
This is frustrating...

279
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,780
Takuma, cheer up.

280
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,980
Eri...

281
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,870
Takuma.

282
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,710
Eri...

283
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,610
Takuma!

284
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:30,890
Robbed

285
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,430
Izakaya Botta

286
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,030
Welcome!

287
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,780
Man... How do I describe this feeling...

288
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,310
It's just like I won the match,
but lost the game...

289
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,910
You didn't even win the match, did you?

290
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:48,910
Or something like that.

291
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,860
You must be that Afro Yamada, right?

292
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,400
This annoying feeling...

293
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,990
This annoying feeling...
Huh... Anyway, can I go home now?

294
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,460
This annoying feeling...
Yes, you are...

295
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:02,740
Come on, don't be a prude!
I don't wanna be alone!

296
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,970
That girl...

297
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,830
She was really pretty...

298
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,190
Who?

299
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,860
Takuma's girlfriend.

300
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,750
Who's Takuma?

301
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:23,920
My ex-boyfriend!
I told you on chat, didn't I?!

302
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,490
So you're that lame paladin...

303
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:30,190
The one hogging
the hunting ground...

304
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,290
The one hogging
the hunting ground...
You just realised now?

305
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,280
Isn't it great already that I noticed?

306
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,540
Welcome!

307
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,580
Actually...

308
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,090
I meant to show my beautiful side
to make him regret today...

309
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,850
I never meant...
to see that happening before me...

310
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,660
Um...

311
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,900
If you're gonna keep me here for long,

312
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:04,990
If you're gonna keep me here for long,
It's starting to
 taste like water...

313
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,260
It's starting to
 taste like water...
can I get a refill?

314
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,280
It's starting to
 taste like water...
Suit yourself.

315
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,410
With pleasure!

316
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:12,450
I'm starting to relax now.

317
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,780
Anyway, Takuma mentioned this earlier,
but what's a pro gamer?

318
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,700
Someone who plays games
and takes sponsors, I guess.

319
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,170
Sponsors? No way.
Give me cola

320
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:23,710
Sponsors? No way.
With pleasure

321
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,920
With pleasure
It's true.

322
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,510
So, you also get paid to play FOS?

323
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,580
I just play that as a side hobby.
I main FPS games.

324
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,700
What's that?
FPS: Short for First-Person Shooter. A Shooting Game With a First-Person Perspective

325
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,560
FPS: Short for First-Person Shooter. A Shooting Game With a First-Person Perspective
Oh, forget it.

326
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,940
FPS: Short for First-Person Shooter. A Shooting Game With a First-Person Perspective

327
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,400
Aren't you being so cold, Yamada?

328
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,820
You're definitely not popular
with girls, I bet.

329
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,070
I'm not.
I've never had a girlfriend either.

330
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,570
Huh? You're kidding me!

331
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,860
But you said that I'm not popular.

332
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,450
Well, yeah, I did...

333
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,240
But there's no way you're not popular
with girls with such face.

334
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,080
Humblebragging
much?!

335
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,839
I'm not interested in romance,
it's kind of unknown to me.

336
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,890
What a waste of a handsome face...

337
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:13,109
It's more fun to play games.

338
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,990
Well... It's not always a smooth sail
on the ship of romance too...

339
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,000
I, for instance,
was cheated on through a game...

340
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,310
That's a tragedy.

341
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:27,609
Tragedy, huh...

342
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,820
Oh, shoot... I want to cry...

343
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,210
Need to wash my hands.

344
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,390
Oh... My shirt's all dirty...

345
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:54,070
I guess it was because I tripped earlier.

346
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,810
Whoa... even my foot's got scraped.

347
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,980
I shouldn't have gone there...

348
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,410
If I'm going to feel like this...

349
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,740
Huh?

350
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:29,420
Th-That guy...
He actually went back home?

351
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,880
I can see him do that...

352
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,260
He looked like he wanted to go home so bad...

353
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,540
He looked like he wanted to go home so bad...
I wanna go home...
I wanna go home...

354
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,260
I wanna go home...
I wanna go home...

355
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,220
Not that it matters to me...
I forced him to tag along, too.

356
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,940
I'm going to be all alone
from here on anyway...

357
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,150
You okay?

358
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,710
What's up with your face?

359
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,130
Yama... Yamaya...

360
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:07,050
Anyway, could you sit down for a bit?

361
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,760
What's that?

362
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,630
A band-aid.

363
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,730
Shoot, it stuck on my fingers.

364
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,540
I'll just apply it like this.

365
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,430
You bought it for me?

366
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,970
The blood on your foot
was bugging me.

367
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,200
But you actually went and bought it?

368
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,980
Well... I also drank
three glasses of cola, too.

369
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,760
Yamada!

370
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Izakaya Botta

371
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,940
Izakaya Botta
Just order to your heart's content!

372
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,370
Izakaya Botta
No, I'm going back now...

373
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,900
Izakaya Botta
Let's drink our fill tonight!

374
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,010
Izakaya Botta
U-Um...

375
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,830
Izakaya Botta
We'll order again here!

376
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,150
Izakaya Botta
With pleasure!

377
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,150
With pleasure!

378
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:22,160
So, Tani's going to watch our surroundings,

379
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,790
we can just focus on the front.

380
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,040
Maybe we can get our K/D higher.

381
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,170
She Got Hungover

382
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,050

My head hurts...

383
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,680
The next map won't score that much...

384
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,080
Wait, I keep hearing someone talking...

385
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,260
I'm telling you,
no face cam for me.

386
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,980
Who's that?

387
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,360
You're so persistent.

388
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,220
Sorry, gonna go AFK for a bit.

389
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,040
I'll be back soon.
