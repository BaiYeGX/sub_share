1
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,210
Runa of the Sasaki family.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,740
She lives with her overprotective mom,

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,740
her kind dad,

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,300
and her brother who takes care of
everything about her ahead of time.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,850
By their hands,
she was brought up like a princess.

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,500
She loves the chocolate doughnuts,

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,310
from a long-established doughnut shop
in the neighbourhood,

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,510
her online game that she's good at,

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,510
and her usual friendly gaming friends.

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:41,020
As for the places, things,
and people she doesn't know...

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,910
She hates them.

12
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,500
Runa, who has been growing
spoiled in the Sasaki family,

13
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,360
tends to just keep her mouth shut
and her head down,
Spacing out...

14
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,030
Spacing out...
thinking someone
will be nice to her someday.

15
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,250
Spacing out...

16
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:30,930
Spacing out...

17
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,420
Spacing out...
But the girls in the class

18
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,260
Spacing out...
don't really like her like that.

19
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,810
Spacing out...
don't really like her like that.
That girl...
She's kind
of unfriendly

20
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:35,640
Spacing out...
That girl...
She's kind
of unfriendly

21
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,640
She was once bullied by her seniors,

22
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,620
She was once bullied by her seniors,
So cocky!
Those ribbons
 are too big

23
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,770
So cocky!
Those ribbons
 are too big

24
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:40,810
Group
but she has 300 friends online,

25
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,600
Group
but she has 300 friends online,
I got bullied

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,740
Group
but she has 300 friends online,

27
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,150
Group
so she doesn't mind.

28
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,770
Group

29
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,020
Even if for three years,
her middle school girl classmates...

30
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,320
Sasaki, you're on duty today, right?

31
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,920
You haven't erased the blackboard?

32
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,030
Oh, right.

33
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,510
...still call her by her last name,

34
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,510
she won't mind at all.

35
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,640
By the way, Runa of the Sasaki family,

36
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,640
has always been a pretty girl.

37
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,150
There are a lot of boys
who adore her in secret,

38
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,820
but sometimes during a school event,
they'd see her in her casual clothes,

39
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,400
which are of a Lolita style.

40
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,080
So her style is a bit different
from other girls,

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,180
and some of the boys are just put off by this.

42
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,060
and some of the boys are just put off by this.
Don't think
 that's quite right...

43
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,020
Don't think
 that's quite right...

44
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,080
To top it off, her brother is a hot guy,

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,890
and so is his childhood friend,
but add super for this.

46
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,560
Basically, her standards for men
would be these two,

47
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,170
and naturally, she'd look at
the guys in her class like this.

48
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,460
Hey, look! I got a new video!

49
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,410
Oh, that's so cute!

50
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,090
You danced with Yukachi!

51
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,530
Hey, try doing the dance here.

52
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,440
Sure.

53
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,560
You do it like this...

54
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,270
What the heck?

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,680
The girls are doing a weird
dance in the classroom

56
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,670
The heck's that?

57
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,870
Oh, shoot! I'm gonna be late!

58
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,230
Acchan, Makorin, bye!

59
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,490
Micchan, bye-bye!

60
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,579
Bye-bye!

61
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,459
You too, Sasaki! Bye-bye!

62
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,610
Good luck!

63
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,060
Yeah!

64
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,200
Runa of the Sasaki family.

65
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,150
Bye-bye.

66
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,630
She's boastful and selfish at home,
but meek outside,

67
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,610
and a super coward.
I Personally Wanna  See
 Some Romance Comedy Stuff

68
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,380
I Personally Wanna  See
 Some Romance Comedy Stuff

69
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,410
Coming!

70
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,740
Recently, Runa of the Sasaki family...

71
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,310
Welcome!

72
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,740
...has found a new friend,
who's a bit of a mature girl.

73
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,810
I came
 to play
I've bought the newest pudding at the store.

74
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,220
I came
 to play

75
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,030
I came
 to play
Akane's a bit mature
compared to the girls in my class.

76
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,280
I came
 to play

77
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,630
Akane.

78
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,330
I saw a weird dance in the class today.

79
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,150
Oh, wow. Let me see.

80
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,110
Even if Runa bullies her
or says something selfish,

81
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,920
Akane still wants to be her friend.

82
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,420
That's why Runa

83
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,230
That's why Runa
Like this

84
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,790
Like this
surely somehow knows

85
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,930
Like this
surely somehow knows
What's that, an eel?

86
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,170
Like this
What's that, an eel?
that they're not equal friends.

87
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,590
that they're not equal friends.

88
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,560
Also...

89
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,840
Oh, hang on.

90
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,720
Got a message from my friend.

91
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:23,820
Got a message from my friend.
Err, let's see

92
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,160
Err, let's see

93
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,350
Err, let's see
But Akane's not

94
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,080
Runa's family or childhood friend,

95
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,950
so she won't act just like Runa wants.

96
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,000
Another friend...

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,110
You could've replied later, come on...
I'm right here.

98
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,320
Even if Runa sulks,
Akane won't try to comfort her.

99
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,840
She won't even notice.

100
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:45,410
Hey, look at this, Runa!

101
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,160
Hey, look at this, Runa!
Angry

102
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,190
They're shooting in front of the station now,
and Sato the actor's there too!

103
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:50,910
Wanna go look?!

104
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,420
You're one of those
bandwagon enjoyers, huh?

105
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,170
You like
famous actors
Yeah! I am!

106
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:56,500
You like
famous actors
Yeah! I am!
And also the
latest products

107
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,340
You like
famous actors
And also the
latest products

108
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,170
You like
famous actors
And also the
latest products
But...

109
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,870
Come on, hurry up!

110
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,460
Wait!

111
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,220
There's a new kind of excitement

112
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,170
she's feeling,
So quick

113
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,210
so different from
when she's with her brother.

114
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,730
Even though she's supposed to be not
fond of unknown things and people.

115
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,270
Sato looked so hot from afar...

116
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,940
Really?

117
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,650
Won't Yamada look better than him?

118
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,200
Yeah, but Yamada's Yamada, right?

119
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,330
You're right.

120
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,960
Oh, look over there!

121
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,640
They're dancing! Looks fun!

122
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,960
I don't understand people
who dance on the street.

123
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,290
Should we join in with that weird dance?

124
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,340
No way!

125
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,820
Isn't it like this, again?

126
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,570
Like this!

127
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,690
But, recently...

128
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,800
She started to think maybe she'd want a lot
more friends to do weird dances together...

129
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,940
...to have some fun.

130
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,240
I need romance in my life...

131
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,990
According to my life plan,

132
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,370
I should've got married
right after I finished college...

133
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,160
Mama gave birth to me
when she was 20,

134
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,760
so I, Momo, would love to marry
at a young age too.

135
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,750
But first, I'd need a husband for that.

136
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,480
Also, to get a husband,
I'd need a boyfriend first.

137
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,930
That's why I think
I need romance in my life...

138
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:39,040
Oh, wait. You should leave
the final blow to the DPS.

139
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,610
Yep, just a little bit left.

140
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,230
I did it! I cleared the quest!

141
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:46,140
So no one's listening
to my blabbering earlier?!

142
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,420
Huh? Sorry!

143
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,550
Anyway, Momo,
I just levelled up to 50 in a week!

144
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,610
Not interested.

145
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,260
If you do what I say,
you can hit the level cap this month.

146
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,620
You know...

147
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,100
You have to indulge yourself in an MMO
with a middle schooler for your free afternoon...

148
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,460
Is she even okay?

149
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,010
She's not running away from home.

150
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,090
But, she's in a cold war with her brother,
and it's hard for her to be in her home.

151
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,790
So why do we have to just play
an MMO with a kid?

152
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,890
Why don't you go home if this bores you?

153
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:17,790
Why don't you go home if this bores you?
I'm not a kid

154
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,020
I'm not a kid
You don't have anything better to do, either.

155
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,400
Silence.

156
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,150
Don't underestimate me, girl.

157
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,060
You sure have it nice,
getting to meet a hot and younger boy.

158
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,210
You talking about Yamada?
My main ma'am, you've got the wrong idea.

159
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,659
Ah, but we're getting closer lately,
and he's added me to his friend list too.

160
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:38,840
Ah, but we're getting closer lately,
and he's added me to his friend list too.
Add as a friend? Sure

161
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,240
Add as a friend? Sure

162
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,169
Add as a friend? Sure
But he's just as blunt as usual,

163
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,890
he won't hunt together with me.

164
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,240
He'd always turn
down my invitations

165
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,500
He'd always turn
down my invitations
Your level difference's way too apart,

166
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,550
He'd always turn
down my invitations
Yamada won't get anything.

167
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,390
But then he'd tell me
about equipment stuff when I ask.

168
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,500
He's surprisingly kind.

169
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,850
Surprisingly?

170
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:59,140
He's always been normally kind
since long ago.

171
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,560
Even now, he's still teaching me,
even though he has his entrance exam.

172
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,340
Oh, so he's pretty popular, right?
Oh, I leveled up again

173
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,320
Oh, I leveled up again
Yeah, he was.

174
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,150
I've never seen him with someone who might be
his girlfriend, maybe he can't handle girls.

175
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,950
Oh, now that's a waste!

176
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,300
Maybe I should nominate
myself as his girlfriend?

177
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,310
Yamada Has Logged In

178
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,940
Yamada Has Logged In
Speak of the devil...

179
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,540
Yamada Has Logged In

180
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,290
Hey, Yamada!

181
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,270
Hi.

182
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,260
Been a while since
I last saw you log in!

183
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,460
Right... I've been busy.

184
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,550
Oh, yeah!

185
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:39,780
I enhanced my shoes thanks
to the method you taught me!

186
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,900
Aren't you getting the wrong mats for enhancing?
Yamada

187
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,610
Huh? But I just needed to equip these
with an INT Jewel, right?

188
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:47,650
I tried copying you, so...

189
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,400
I tried copying you, so...
INT: Mana Up

190
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,810
INT: Mana Up
I'm a magician,
so of course I'd go INT,

191
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,780
INT: Mana Up
but a paladin should go
for VIT instead.

192
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,410
INT: Mana Up
Huh?! So I can't use this...?
VIT: Health Up

193
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,400
It takes 999
 jewel pieces to
make a jewel...

194
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,870
It takes 999
 jewel pieces to
make a jewel...
I've worked hard in gathering these...

195
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,070
It takes 999
 jewel pieces to
make a jewel...
Want my spare shoes?

196
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,790
It takes 999
 jewel pieces to
make a jewel...
They're for a shielder,
and some even have been fully enhanced.

197
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,890
They're for a shielder,
and some even have been fully enhanced.

198
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,290
Nah, I'm good.

199
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,510
I just have to gather these
VIT jewel pieces, right?

200
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,890
I'll go for another hunt to gather them.

201
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,520
I already know where they might drop too.

202
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,020
Right

203
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,420
Right.

204
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,580
Sorry for the blunt comment.

205
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
Good luck with your enhancing.

206
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,330
He sent a smiley?!

207
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,940
Now that's unusual.

208
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,550
She's screaming by herself?

209
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,320
Has she finally lost it?

210
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,830
That looks fun...

211
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:52,640
So boring! It's so boring looking
at you gaming all day!

212
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,800
I wanna go out! On a mixer!

213
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,660
Maybe you should try playing this too?
It's pretty fun, you know?

214
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,840
I can't...

215
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,720
Come on, don't say that...

216
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,630
I don't know stuff about PCs!

217
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,410
The controls are pretty easy
once you've got the hang of it.

218
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:17,820
I'll go for some hunting now,
so just watch.

219
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,150
I don't really know much about PCs,

220
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:33,630
but isn't it a bad sign
that smoke is coming out of this?

221
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,310
Akane's PC machine broke?

222
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,720
Yeah, it kind of exploded
when she was playing the game.

223
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:43,790
Yeah, it kind of exploded
when she was playing the game.
Exploded...

224
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,230
Exploded...
FOS got heavier since the last update too...

225
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,510
Maybe it's just too much for the PC.

226
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:55,110
She said she won't be able to play
until she saves enough to buy a new one.

227
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,400
She Won't Look Him in the Face during Cold War

228
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,970
She Won't Look Him in the Face during Cold War
She got pretty sad.

229
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,110
She Won't Look Him in the Face during Cold War

230
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,370
Hmm...

231
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,470
Coming.

232
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,880
May I help...

233
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,550
Hi.

234
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,820
I brought a repairman.

235
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,060
Yo.

236
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,540
Eita Sasaki

237
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,050
Ignoring

238
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,390
Eita Sasaki

239
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:13,920
Yes...?

240
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,780
Morning, Yamada!

241
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,520
Hey...

242
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,970
What?

243
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,780
Say, you got an old PC lying around?

244
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,110
Like, your previous build.

245
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,100
No...

246
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,360
Akane's PC seemed to have broken.

247
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,580
I heard there was smoke
coming out of it.

248
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,970
Smoke? From where...?

249
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,150
I didn't see, so I don't know.

250
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,600
Can you take a look at her PC
when you have time?

251
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,340
Me?

252
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,290
Maybe it could be fixed
with a simple parts swap.

253
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,430
Shouldn't you be going instead...?

254
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,480
Sure, I could do that,

255
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,130
Sure, I could do that,
You two get
along well too...

256
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,690
You two get
along well too...
but it'd be bad if I made a mistake, right?

257
00:13:59,690 --> 00:13:59,740
but it'd be bad if I made a mistake, right?

258
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:03,950
A healthy man visiting
a cute college girl's house...

259
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,450
It's a bit dangerous, too.

260
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,960
What do you consider me, then?

261
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,920
A new breed of man.

262
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,080
Runa said Akane's pretty sad about it.

263
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,250
Akane's been grinding hard in FOS too
these days, so it's a pity.

264
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,750
Just drop by after
you're done tutoring Runa.

265
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,640
Eita Sasaki
Runa will take you to Akane's place, okay?

266
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,050
Runa will take you to Akane's place, okay?

267
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,500
Pretty please?

268
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,680
Nah, I'm good.

269
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,090
I just have to gather these
VIT jewel pieces, right?

270
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,010
I'll go for another hunt to gather them.

271
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,910
Yamada's here to fix the PC?!

272
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,190
A God...
Yeah! I brought him here!
A God...

273
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,820
A God...
A God...
I'm just here to take a look.

274
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,560
A God...
A God...
Don't expect too much from me.

275
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,420
A God...
A God...
Me!

276
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,580
Please don't look at me like that.
Jesus...
Jesus...

277
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,850
Jesus...
Jesus...
I don't even know if I can fix it.

278
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,420
Jesus...
Jesus...
Me!

279
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,740
Broken

280
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,430
Broken
A laptop, huh...

281
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,700
Make yourselves at home.

282
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,610
Want some snacks?

283
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,310
No need...

284
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,060
I want!

285
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:13,820
High-Grade
Senbei

286
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,910

Yamada's so nice!

287
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:16,530
High-Grade

288
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:18,310
High-Grade

Akane, Akane.

289
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,280
You know, the stuff over there...

290
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,940
There.

291
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,540
Is that okay?

292
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,790
Good thing he didn't notice.

293
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,300
Good thing he didn't notice.
Thanks, Runa

294
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,210
Thanks, Runa
Well, it's Yamada, so I guess he won't mind.

295
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:42,040
It feels a bit strange having him,

296
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,780
but Runa said this too.

297
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,090
He can't handle girls.

298
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,630
If I act weird around him,
he'll have a hard time fixing the laptop.

299
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,780
Let's just act normal.

300
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,510
Have you two eaten your lunch?

301
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,810
If you haven't,
I'll make a simple meal.

302
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,020
I'll eat!

303
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,330
How about you, Yamada?

304
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:04,890
Sure.

305
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,180
I'll have some.

306
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,980
Oh, now that's unusual.

307
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,850
Expectation
I'm not hungry

308
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,820
Expectation
I'm not hungry
Sure.

309
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,200
Expectation
I'm not hungry

310
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,970
I forgot to mention this, but...

311
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,050
The curry the other day...

312
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,470
It was very delicious.

313
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,230
I'm sorry.

314
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,090
I just remembered now,
so I forgot to bring the containers back.

315
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,640
I'm so happy!

316
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:29,410
Curry?

317
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:31,040
Curry?
I'll make the meal with all my heart,

318
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,100
Curry?
so eat your fill, okay!

319
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,600
There's a new girl in our guild.

320
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,710
Huh?!

321
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,550
She really seems honest, and so cute.

322
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,780
Rurihime!

323
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,220
I got scolded again
by a random player in a dungeon...

324
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,230
I'm against bullying newbies!

325
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,170
Her emotions are as clear as day,

326
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:57,940
and she doesn't hide what she feels.

327
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:04,160
I think an open book like her
would be a great match for you, Akito.

328
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,900
I won't approve such outsider!

329
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,099
Who are you, his sister-in-law?

330
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,510
Not interested.

331
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,770
The adapter port's loose.

332
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,000
The adapter port's loose.
Adapt-what?

333
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,020
Adapt-what?

334
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,180
When did you buy this?

335
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,530
I bought it since I got
admitted to college, so...

344

You haven't even cleaned
your keyboard once, have you?

356
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,340
Do I have to?

357
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,950
There's a trace of liquid here.

358
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,880
Stop! Don't look!

359
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,560
The weather's so nice today.

360
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,550
Akane.

361
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,710
What's up? It's almost done.

362
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,980
You know...

363
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:43,520
Do you have a plan to go to the bath now?

364
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,730
Do you have a plan to go to the bath now?

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,730
No.

366
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,310
I'm cooking now,
so I'll go at night.

367
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:58,380
Yamada, you going to the bath?

368
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,550
No.

369
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:04,070
I don't really get it,
but I'll just let her be.

370
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,370
Akane! I'll have a slice of bread!

371
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,340
Go ahead.

372
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,580
Won't you get full
if you eat that much?

373
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,550
I'm making you omelet rice now.

374
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,050
Don't worry.
I'm not the one eating this.

375
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,310

Why did you eat it?!
Broken

378
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,170
Why did you eat it?!

379
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,820
Why did you even feed me?

380
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,590
Geez, come here!

381
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,280
Wait!

382
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,850
If you don't get closer,

383
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:38,240
- It's dangerous, so stop pushing me!
- there won't be any lucky perverted moments!

384
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,880
What are you—

385
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,160
Huh?

386
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,880
What should I do from here?

387
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,190
Gosh... Cut it out!

388
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,420
Ugh... Oww...

389
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,440
Yamada? What's wrong?

390
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,490
Your hair hit my eyeball...

391
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,180
What?! Sorry!

392
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,310
Are you okay?
Did it get in your eye?

393
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,990
Oww...

394
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,420
Let me see.

395
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,170
Which one?

396
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,300
I'm...

397
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,850
Okay...

398
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:27,780
Oh, shoot!

399
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,890
I brought my face closer
to his out of panic!

400
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,840
But could it be
that he hates is so much?!

401
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,330
Sorry, Yamada!

402
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,960
You apologise too, Runa!

403
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,070
Sorry...

404
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:39,680
I'm sowwy...

405
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,100
I'll put my hair up.

406
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,670
Um..

407
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:43,470
Yes!

408
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,440
I'll go back home for a bit.

409
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,170
Huh?!

410
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,700
Need to grab the needed tools for this.

411
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,160
But...

412
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,550
I'll be back soon.

413
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,370
Won't you get tired going back and forth?

414
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,560
I'd feel bad...

415
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,610
Don't worry.

416
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,830
It's close by.

417
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,330
He seemed to be running away.

418
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,900
You really think so?

419
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,340
Maybe he really hated it after all?

420
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,010
So it's true that he can't handle girls?

421
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,700
I might've done something bad to him...

422
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,520
A girl with a small amount of hair.

423
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:05,440

424
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,000

429
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:14,250

As for a girl with a big amount of hair...

Not at all.

445

A maiden's troubles are endless.
