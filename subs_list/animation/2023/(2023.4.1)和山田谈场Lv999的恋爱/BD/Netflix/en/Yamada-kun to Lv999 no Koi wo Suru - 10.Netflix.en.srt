ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,272
CRAM SCHOOL

5
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,571
Has he answered?

6
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,407
<i>No.</i>

7
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:01,038
Maybe his tutoring lesson
has taken longer than he thought.

8
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:04,542
Even so, it's rare for him
not to leave a message.

9
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:07,128
You never know, maybe he's with a woman.

10
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,589
That phone call from before
was pretty suspicious too.

11
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,301
Yamada-kun's not the type.

12
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:16,846
You don't get it, Ms. President.

13
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,764
If you don't get serious,

14
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:21,851
another woman will pop up
one day and snatch him from you.

15
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:28,858
I know that.

16
00:02:31,694 --> 00:02:33,112
I know, okay?

17
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,030
Don't try to frighten me.

18
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,161
If it bothers you that much,

19
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,288
why don't you just tell him?

20
00:02:43,122 --> 00:02:45,040
What's stopping you?

21
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,004
<i>One day, he'll meet someone.</i>

22
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,173
<i>I have that feeling.</i>

23
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,055
Yamada-kun, you know GOS:E, don't you?

24
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:01,974
It's an FPS game.

25
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,392
You play it, right?

26
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,395
You had a match with me
yesterday, at 10 p.m.

27
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:07,646
Do you remember?

28
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:11,817
I'm Yukari Tsubaki from Class D.

29
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,446
I went by the name "YT03"
when I battled you.

30
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,781
If you don't mind,

31
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,075
I'd like you to demonstrate how you play.

32
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,160
I DON'T REMEMBER AT ALL…

33
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,370
Why?

34
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,372
I'm wondering about a few things.

35
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:28,626
She thinks you're cheating.

36
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:35,633
Once you see it, please leave.

37
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,634
Of course.

38
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,885
Tsubaki,

39
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,387
make sure to watch
my dazzling play later too.

40
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,497
To be honest, I was suspicious.

41
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,667
I didn't believe anyone could
play like that on skill alone.

42
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:15,673
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:18,133
It was my own ignorance.

44
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,718
Talented people exist.

45
00:04:21,303 --> 00:04:22,930
Have you thought about turning pro?

46
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,649
<i>Just like I met him…</i>

47
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,863
<i>one day…</i>

48
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:44,368
<i>he'll meet someone.</i>

49
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,262
<i>For someone whose looks</i>
<i>draw so much attention,</i>

50
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,472
<i>he's quiet and reserved.</i>

51
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,684
<i>Despite the emotionless way he talks,</i>

52
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,686
<i>he's thought of as pretty kind.</i>

53
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,605
<i>The people who are closest to him</i>

54
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,065
<i>know all that well.</i>

55
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,151
<i>But they also know…</i>

56
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,111
Yamada-kun,

57
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,031
we were at the same
committee meeting last week.

58
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:25,200
You were a big help and…

59
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:26,827
I wanted…

60
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,620
Have we spoken before?

61
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,041
<i>He can be a bit cruel.</i>

62
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,626
Hey, did you hear?

63
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,878
Shiraishi from Class B

64
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:38,464
finally asked Yamada out.

65
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:39,548
For real?

66
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,759
But he shot her down.

67
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,386
If Shiraishi isn't good enough
for him, who is?

68
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,221
Maybe he's not into women.

69
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:49,349

As popular as you are,
if you remain single,

75
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,570
people will start to gossip.

76
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:03,781
NO RESPONSE

77
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:07,409
Does it really matter what people think?

78
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,369
That's true,

79
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,039
but I feel bad hearing people
say as they please about you.

80
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,374
{\an8}Do you at least have a type?

81
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,043
{\an8}Not really.

82
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,378
You must have some sort of preference.

83
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,047
None.

84
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,007
{\an8}Seriously? Then, what about a first love--

85
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,133
I really…

86
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:26,887
don't.

87
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,348
<i>He sighed!</i>

88
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,435
-Forgive me…
-No, I'm sorry.

89
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,145
I've been pestering you.

90
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,440
{\an8}OOPS…

91
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,525
{\an8}<i>Better learn my lesson.</i>

92
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,151
Um…

93
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:45,197
So then…

94
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,449
Now that you mention it…

95
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,408
Huh?

96
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,412
A long time ago, there was a girl
who had a crush on me.

97
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,041
She was bullied badly…

98
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,167
BUILLIED?

99
00:06:57,251 --> 00:07:00,212
…and stopped coming to school most days.

100
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:06,635
<i>Her house was near mine,</i>

101
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,263
<i>so our teacher asked me</i>
<i>to deliver things to her</i>

102
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,932
<i>and we became friends before long.</i>

103
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,018
<i>But even on days</i>
<i>when she did come to school,</i>

104
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,563
<i>she felt lost if I wasn't there</i>

105
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,025
<i>and I tried to stay</i>
<i>by her side at all times.</i>

106
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,446
So then,

107
00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:28,490
you liked her, right?

108
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,619
<i>Akito…</i>

109
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:34,913
<i>will you stay with me forever,</i>

110
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:36,373
<i>even when we're adults?</i>

111
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:39,418
<i>How could I know that?</i>

112
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,088
<i>I was just doing</i>

113
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,340
<i>what our teacher</i>

114
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,717
<i>told me to do.</i>

115
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,682
The bullying never stopped,

116
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,184
and she eventually transferred.

117
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,397
But sometimes I think back…

118
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,737
<i>The last time we spoke,</i>

119
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,238
<i>I made her cry badly,</i>

120
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,783
<i>and I wonder what the correct thing</i>

121
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,619
<i>would've been to say.</i>

122
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,707
I couldn't understand

123
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,879
and somehow, it got to be a pain.

124
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,049
Ever since then,

125
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:30,010
girls make me really uncomfortable.

126
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,558
<i>So that's it.</i>

127
00:08:36,642 --> 00:08:40,312
<i>He has no interest in himself.</i>

128
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,066
<i>So even when people have feelings for him,</i>

129
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,901
<i>he can't see it.</i>

130
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:50,280
<i>Or maybe he tries not to.</i>

131
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,077
<i>"It got to be a pain"?</i>

132
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,411
<i>Talk about scary.</i>

133
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,289

{\an8}What are you doing here?

186
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,319
{\an8}VENTILATING

187
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:17,237
WHAT?!

188
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,822
I know. It must be a dream!

189
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,323
So cold…

190
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:24,327
SHE SURE SNEEZES VIOLENTLY…

191
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,707
You can stand now, I see.

192
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,834
How do you feel?

193
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,044
Surprised.

194
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:34,713
That's not what I meant.

195
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,756
This isn't a dream? Why are you here?

196
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,716
I don't want you to catch my cold!

197
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,301
It hurts!

198
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,178
I'll explain properly,

199
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,971
so please get back in bed.

200
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,931
You couldn't even drink.

201
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:46,516
It was a dangerous situation.

202
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,936
Yeah…

203
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:55,984
And so…

204
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,277
How are you feeling?

205
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,197
Well…

206
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,990
when I woke up, it felt like

207
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:03,950
I had gotten a little better.

208
00:13:04,034 --> 00:13:05,035
I WONDER WHY…

209
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,079
Glad to hear it.

210
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,789
I came to check and found you

211
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,458
collapsed near your bicycle.

212
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,417
Really?!

213
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,586
<i>Now that you mention it.</i>

214
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,379
<i>-For a split-second.</i>
-You'd better get back inside.

215
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,673
<i>I did think I saw him.</i>

216
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:22,427
<i>So then, he really did come to my aid.</i>

217
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,180
You were in pretty bad shape.

218
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:27,516
<i>He was worried</i>

219
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,684
<i>and came to check on me?</i>

220
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:33,396
<i>Was he here all night,</i>

221
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,690
{\an8}<i>even though he could catch my cold?</i>

222
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:36,816
{\an8}STUNNED…

223
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,445
<i>-Why is he so kind?</i>
-I found a hospital with evening care.

224
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,447
<i>-Just for my sake?</i>
-And you saw a doctor.

225
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,661
Huh?

226
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:49,621
I'm really happy.

227
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,540
Thank you, Yamada.

228
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,377
It was awful being alone like this.

229
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,254
You saved my life!

230
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,341
I don't know how to thank you!

231
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,634
{\an8}You're an angel!

232
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,969
{\an8}Uh, right.

233
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,011
{\an8}GIDDY FROM HER FEAVER

234
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:07,347
{\an8}Anyway, if I can continue…

235
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,349
I'm so sorry for ever saying

236
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,060
that you act cold!

237
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,937
<i>Did she say that to me?</i>

238
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,815
From the beginning,
you've always been kind!

239
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,441
If you keep moving, you'll fall.

240
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,987
Excuse me, I stepped on your book.

241
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,990
Hey wait, that's…

242
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,366
<i>FOR ALL THOSE WITH BROKEN HEARTS</i>

243
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:29,744
I had time on my hands,
so I took the liberty of reading it.

244
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,788
It's a good book, right?

245
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:35,250
It really helped me a lot.

246
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,294
I didn't quite get it.

247
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,713
It's not written for people like you.

248
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,131
You're the type

249
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,883
who rejects more than they're rejected.

250
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:44,676
That's not--

251
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,136
There you go again…

252
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,555
{\an8}You're acting kind of scary.

253
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,309
Oh, the pain…

254
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,313
Well, I'm sure having to
reject people is tough too.

255
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,900
Especially for someone kind like you.

256
00:15:05,447 --> 00:15:06,448
<i>I…</i>

257
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:11,745
I'm not… that nice a guy.

258
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,667
Takuma had the same expression.

259
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,296
In pain from guilt or something…

260
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,465
He looked like he wanted to disappear.

261
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,718
Don't worry about it so much. It's love.

262
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:28,303
That's how it is.

263
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,181
Even though he cheated?

264
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,058
Well…

265
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,435
Now that some time has passed,

266
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:40,815
<i>I feel kind of grateful that</i>
<i>he broke it off cleanly, rather than lie.</i>

267
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,860
<i>I'm sorry, Akane.</i>

268
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:46,988
<i>Thanks to that, I avoided the worst.</i>

269
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:50,700
<i>Forgive me.</i>

270
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,453
<i>I knew I couldn't change his mind,</i>

271
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:56,706
<i>so I accepted the breakup, right away.</i>

272
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,542
<i>I understand.</i>

273
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,211
<i>Besides,</i>

274
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,838
<i>one day, this will all be</i>
<i>a nostalgic memory</i>

275
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,132
<i>and rather than crying in despair,</i>

276
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,593
<i>I'd rather him remember me smiling.</i>

277
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,888
I want him to think,
"She was a good woman."

278
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:15,058
"I shouldn't have let her get away."

279
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,479
Wouldn't that be better?

280
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,364
You… felt sorry for me?

281
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,077
Goodbye, Akito.

282
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,585
I'm sorry!

283
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:46,256
Thank you for always being there for me!

284
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,261
Goodbye!

285
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,363
Yeah.

286
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,666
OFFLINE MEMBERS
YAMADA

287
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,922
Is your fever down?

288
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,716
I think so.

289
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:30,967
I DON'T KNOW HOW HIGH IT WAS, THOUGH…

290
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,012
Mind if I eat the yogurt you bought me?

291
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,180
Go ahead.

292
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,852
MUNCH MUCH
SNIFFLE SNIFFLE

293
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,395
It's so good, you're in tears?

294
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:44,522
Swallowing is really painful.

295
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,404
<i>If it had been a man</i>
<i>other than Yamada here,</i>

296
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:54,324
<i>I probably would have panicked.</i>

297
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:56,076
<i>What is it about him</i>

298
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,537
<i>that makes me feel so safe and secure?</i>

299
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:00,663
I SEE ANGEL WINGS…

300
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:05,085
<i>Then again, it only brings him trouble.</i>

301
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,171
<i>It just adds to his discomfort with girls.</i>

302
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,256
Thank you for the meal.

303
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,925
Could you put this over there?

304
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,593
Sure.

305
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:18,681
Oh, no…

306
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,561
My leg…

307
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:25,271
I think it's gonna cramp…

308
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:27,065
It's cramping. Ow…

309
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,358
-Th… that…
-You should stretch--

310
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,443
Oh my god, that hurts!

311
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,195
You'd better stretch it.

312
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,198
AGONY

313
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,700
<i>All right…</i>

314
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,619
Akane!

315
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:45,333
Please extend your leg.

316
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:46,835
Ow!

317
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,254
No way! It's too painful!

318
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,340
Don't touch it!

319
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,092
Quiet down.

320
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,095
Just a little longer.

321
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:01,307
Oh, that hurts! It hurts! It…

322
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,648
feels better.

323
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,567
Right?

324
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,487
I thought I was gonna die.

325
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,197
You're exagg--

326
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,993
It really did hurt.

327
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,834
<i>Huh?</i>

328
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:33,173
<i>Somehow, it's almost</i>
<i>as if he's staring at me.</i>

329
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,592
<i>Wait…</i>

330
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:39,053
<i>Why did I think he…</i>

331
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:44,851
<i>was safe?</i>

332
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:50,732
PICKED UP A FALLEN SPOON

333
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:51,482
HIT HER HEAD

334
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,360
What? I didn't dodge, I swear!

335
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,742
What? Why are you laughing?

336
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,494
No reason.

337
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,331
What's there to laugh about?!

338
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,875
You've got it wrong! Really!

339
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,925
You've got it wrong!

340
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,680
I'll be going, then.

341
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:48,016
You're going to school on no sleep?

342
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:50,351
Yes. I'm used to it.

343
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,562
I'm really sorry.

344
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,981
If you start feeling bad, tell me.

345
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,318
{\an8}And thank you for the hospital
and everything else.

346
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,862
{\an8}I'll do something to pay you back soon.

347
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,364
I didn't do anything major.

348
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:05,408
Please don't worry about it.

349
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,952
They said to return in the afternoon

350
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:11,289
after a day had passed.

351
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,665
If you could, do that please.

352
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,501
It should be okay.

353
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,627
IT WAS ENDO HOSPITAL, RIGHT?

354
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,588
They said that at night,

355
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,631
they can't do a detailed examination.

356
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,469
But then, you got better from the IV,

357
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,137
so it's probably just a precaution.

358
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,517
Anyway, sorry for the intrusion.

359
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,021
Excuse me…

360
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:36,898
I didn't know you were that close.

361
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:40,193
No, I'm sorry. I stood too close.

362
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,487
<i>My body</i>

363
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:46,074
<i>almost seemed to be moving on its own.</i>

364
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,292
Akane… I have to go.

365
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,507
Oh, s… sorry! It's nothing! Go on!

366
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,424
Will you be okay?

367
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,884
I'm fine! Just go on!

368
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:05,968
Oh, I know!

369
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,304
After I visit the clinic,
I can tell you how it went.

370
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:10,473
I'm sure it's just an ordinary cold.

371
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,767
Oh, is it unnecessary?

372
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:15,937
It m… might already have spread to you.

373
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,814
I thought maybe you were worried.

374
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,607
That's all!

375
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,110
In that case…

376
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,694
-Please do.
-Right!

377
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,200
Take care.

378
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,877
