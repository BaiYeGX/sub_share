1
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:08,009
Anyway, Tani's watching the perimeter.

2
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:10,928
We can concentrate on the front lines.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,763
{\an8}We might wrack up a lot of kills.

4
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,390
{\an8}<i>My head is killing me…</i>

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,226
Especially on the next map.

6
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:21,772
<i>And why do I keep hearing someone's voice?</i>

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,942
I told you, I'm not turning the camera on.

8
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,486
<i>Who's there?</i>

9
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,197
Quit pestering me.

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:43,502
Sorry, I have to step away.

11
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,256
I'll be right back.

12
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,885
<i>What's…</i>

13
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,975
<i>going on?</i>

14
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,146
-Excuse me…
-Yes?!

15
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,405
<i>Um…</i>

16
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:13,574
{\an8}DATA POINT 1:
DRUNKEN MEMORY LOSS

17
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,284
{\an8}<i>Did I…?</i>

18
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,577
{\an8}DATA POINT 2:
UNFAMILIAR BEDROOM

19
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,163
{\an8}<i>Don't tell me this is…</i>

20
00:01:19,246 --> 00:01:20,581
{\an8}DATA POINT 3: SKIN EXPOSED

21
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,083
{\an8}DATA POINT 4: MALE, YAMADA

22
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,044
{\an8}Is this a one-night stand?!

23
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,921
{\an8}-Does it look that way?
-Unfortunately!

24
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:41,018
ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

25
00:02:58,596 --> 00:02:59,972
To summarize…

26
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,475
<i>It was either carry you home…</i>

27
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,144
IZAKAYA BOTTA

28
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,771
<i>…or dump you in the street.</i>

29
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,152
Even I thought that would be unethical.

30
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:15,696
I'm truly sorry.

31
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:16,614
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, THOUGH

32
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,240
I promise to repay--

33
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,284
If you leave immediately, that'll do.

34
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,869
Right! I'll leave immediately!

35
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,624
By the way, your clothes
were covered in vomit.

36
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,209
You'll find them washed in the bathroom.

37
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:32,129
Oh, and… I paid your bill at the <i>izakaya.</i>

38
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,381
I'll pay you back immediately!

39
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,050
<i>This is bad…</i>

40
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,176
Excuse me, um…

41
00:03:37,259 --> 00:03:38,886
Where is the bathroom?

42
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,679
Out the door, to your right.

43
00:03:40,763 --> 00:03:42,640
<i>I'm never going to live this down.</i>

44
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,767
<i>Well,</i>

45
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,644
<i>I doubt we'll meet again, but…</i>

46
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:49,396
Take care.

47
00:03:58,113 --> 00:03:59,531
<i>What a mess.</i>

48
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,578
<i>On top of it all, I spent the night</i>
<i>in the room of a guy I just met.</i>

49
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,374
<i>Mom, if you hear me in Gunma, I'm sorry.</i>

50
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,298
<i>I'm beat.</i>

51
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,636
<i>I'd better do some schoolwork.</i>

52
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:28,769
<i>Hey…</i>

53
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,234
<i>Wasn't I…</i>

54
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,153
<i>wearing a necklace?</i>

55
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:41,282
<i>Um, why is it gone?</i>

56
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:55,879
<i>It's not here.</i>

57
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,345
<i>Your clothes were covered in vomit.</i>

58
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,306
<i>You'll find them washed in the bathroom.</i>

59
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,767
<i>Don't tell me…</i>

60
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,896
<i>I dropped it in Yamada's apartment?</i>

61
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,859
SYSTEM: AKANE HAS LOGGED IN

62
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,364
Oh! Hi there, Akane!

63
00:05:22,448 --> 00:05:24,283
{\an8}GUILD: CHOCOLATE RABBIT
GUILDMASTER: PRINCESS RURI

64
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:26,493
Hi there, Princess Ruri!

65
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,370
<i>Yamada… What about Yamada?</i>

66
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,663
OFFLINE MEMBERS: I LOVE BEEF,
YAMADA, MATCHA PUDDING, TAKEZO

67
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,915
<i>He's offline.</i>

68
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,918
<i>I know I had it on at the</i> izakaya.

69
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,713
<i>If I lost it,</i>
<i>it must have been after that.</i>

70
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,925
<i>It really must have been when</i>
<i>I took my clothes off in Yamada's room.</i>

71
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,179
<i>What do I do?</i>

72
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,974
<i>That necklace</i>

73
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,894
<i>was the first gift I ever got from Takuma.</i>

74
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,772
What's this?

75
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,440
Akane, are you frozen?

76
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,068
You don't seem to be in good spirits.

77
00:06:01,487 --> 00:06:02,863
AKANE: I HAVE A LOT GOING ON IRL.

78
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,823
RURI: OH? TROUBLE OF SOME KIND?

79
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,326
AKANE: SOMETHING LIKE THAT…

80
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,331
Ruri will listen, if you like!

81
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,583
I'm the Guild Master, after all.

82
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,293
You can depend on me!

83
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,506
You're so cute, Princess Ruri.

84
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,673
SO SOOTHING…

85
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,009
I see.

86
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,677
Your boyfriend broke up with you

87
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,305
and you lost a memento.

88
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,099
I understand.

89
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:33,477
My fans give me all sorts of presents,

90
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,937
and they're all precious to me.

91
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,147
They have memories attached, right?

92
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:38,065
SHE HAS… LOTS OF FANS…

93
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:41,443
Although I'm running out of space
to store them in.

94
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,569
Wow…

95
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:43,529
IT'S A CRIME TO BE CUTE

96
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,949
SYSTEM: YAMADA HAS LOGGED IN

97
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,826
Hi there, Yamada-kun!

98
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:50,828
Hi.

99
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,454
<i>Yamada's here!</i>

100
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:53,413
<i>Now then…</i>

101
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,415
-Say, Yamada-kun…
-Yamada! Hey, Yamada!

102
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:58,168
-Join us for some love gossip.
-Ya… Yamada…

103
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,712
I can't. The bosses
should be appearing soon.

104
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,422
You're hunting bosses again?

105
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,924
It's double-reward season.

106
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,300
Really?! For how long?

107
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,260
YAMADA: THIS WEEK ONLY

108
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,427
RURI: I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE!

109
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:10,264
<i>She's so excited,</i>
<i>I can't even get a word in.</i>

110
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:12,057
<i>I'll try a private chat.</i>

111
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:13,559
AKANE: YAMADA!!!!!! I MAY HAVE LOST
MY NECKLACE AT YOUR PLACE. SEEN IT?!

112
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,311
<i>Oh, did he notice?</i>

113
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:17,688
YAMADA: NO.

114
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,440
<i>That was quick.</i>

115
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,691
<i>Did he even…?</i>

116
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:24,445
Yamada-kun, come chat with us.

117
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,405
{\an8}It will cheer Akane up.

118
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,115
-Rather not.
-You're awful!

119
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,741
More importantly,

120
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,076
the guild treasure chest…

121
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,037
{\an8}It's always so full, I can't use it.

122
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:34,955
{\an8}Huh?

123
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,332
{\an8}Oh, you're right!
There are a lot of items inside!

124
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,335
I haven't been checking it.

125
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,962
I'm always cleaning it out,

126
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,755
but it fills up before I know it.

127
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,424
That's strange. I wonder why?

128
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,759
<i>If it's not in Yamada's apartment,</i>

129
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,803
<i>could it be at the</i> izakaya?

130
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:53,307
Maybe someone thinks they're
being helpful by putting items in.

131
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,684
-Oh, that was me--
-What?!

132
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,561
This garbage is "helpful"?

133
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,314
You don't have to call it garbage.

134
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:04,026
A guild member must be putting items
in the chest to help beginners.

135
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,861
Even someone who started three minutes ago

136
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,113
would have better equipment than this.

137
00:08:08,197 --> 00:08:09,156
Now, now…

138
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:13,035
What if the guild members were online?

139
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,162
They'd be shocked if they read this chat.

140
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,041
It was me.

141
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:23,045
{\an8}AKANE: IT WAS ME. I THOUGHT BEGINNERS
COULD USE EQUIPMENT I NO LONGER NEEDED.

142
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,214
{\an8}AKANE: SORRY, I GUESS IT'S IN THE WAY.

143
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,925
{\an8}RURI: THAT'S NOT TRUE!
YOU'RE SO KIND, AKANE!

144
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,177
-It's in the way.
-Yamada-kun!

145
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,805
I'm the one who's been
forced to clean up that garbage.

146
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,474
Stop calling it "garbage"!

147
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,353
Akane only did it to be helpful!

148
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,980
Please be more selective.

149
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,774
Storage space is limited.

150
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:44,816
Yamada-kun!

151
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:48,320
Don't be mean! You have to
choose your words better!

152
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,489
Naughty!

153
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,241
SYSTEM: AKANE HAS LOGGED OUT.

154
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,452
{\an8}RURI: OH NO…

155
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,829
{\an8}RURI: BE NICER TO AKANE!

156
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,415
{\an8}RURI: SHE'S NOT A GAMER, YOU KNOW!

157
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,006
That hurt.

158
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,299
CRUNCH?

159
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,425
Did I step on something?

160
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,398
Seriously?

161
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,317
<i>I hate you, Yamada!</i>

162
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,124
Akane…

163
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,085
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,546
I was out of line.

165
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,633
I finally see it now.

166
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,553
Takuma…

167
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,306
This is for you.

168
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:00,225
An apology present.

169
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,727
I hope you'll accept it.

170
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:05,647
I'm really happy, Takuma!

171
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,190
<i>Takuma…</i>

172
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,570
<i>Takuma…</i>

173
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,324
Takuma!

174
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,584
<i>A nightmare…</i>

175
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:29,004
Sounds more like a prophetic dream.

176
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,383
Momo, are you enjoying this?

177
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,468
Not really.

178
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:37,512
I'm actually sick of hearing about Takuma.

179
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:40,015
That was a fake laugh too.

180
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,061
On the other hand,

181
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,938
I'd love to hear more about
the hot online game otaku.

182
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,523
You really spent the night with him

183
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,901
and nothing happened?

184
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,361
That again?

185
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,904
I told you, nothing happened.

186
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:56,615
He was just doing a good deed.

187
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,743
That reminds me,

188
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,287
what do I do about Takuma's necklace?

189
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:05,749
I'm sure I lost it at Yamada's apartment.

190
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:09,378
What good is a present
from the guy who cast you aside?

191
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:10,253
CAST ASIDE

192
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,213
Just get over it.

193
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,047
GET OVER IT

194
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:14,925
You've always been like that, Akane.

195
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,095
You prioritize your boyfriends
over your social life,

196
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:21,765
and you even start playing
dumb online games for them.

197
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,601
Now that you mention it, didn't you start

198
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,937
making lunch
for him after your first date?

199
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,773
It's all too heavy.

200
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,776
I'll stop talking about Takuma.

201
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,403
Please forgive me.

202
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:35,654
Live and learn.

203
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,950
<i>It's already six, huh?</i>

204
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:42,577
<i>Time to head home, do my laundry, and…</i>

205
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,456
<i>I wonder what's on TV tonight.</i>

206
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,583
<i>My nights are free now.</i>

207
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,671
<i>Playing that game alone is boring too.</i>

208
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,839
<i>It's in the way.</i>

209
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,760
<i>I haven't logged in since that day.</i>

210
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,429
<i>I wonder if that surly afro-head</i>

211
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,639
<i>is still his addict self.</i>

212
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,599
I'm sorry, Akito…

213
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,854
I called you here,

214
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,230
so I should get to the point.

215
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,317
I, um… well…

216
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,278
You see…

217
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,447
<i>High-school kids…</i>

218
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,240
<i>She must be asking him out.</i>

219
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,784
<i>Those were the days.</i>

220
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,995
<i>I'll bet the guy is popular.</i>

221
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:31,543
<i>I confessed to my high school</i> senpai
<i>like that too.</i>

222
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,837
-I like you!
-I have a girlfriend.

223
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,630
<i>That hottie, Saito…</i>

224
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,382
<i>I wonder how he's doing.</i>

225
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,758
BITTERSWEET MEMORIES…

226
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,843
So, um…

227
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:40,802
How much longer?

228
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:46,308
It's been about seven minutes
since you stopped me.

229
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,060
Can you do some bullet points

230
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,479
and contact me another day?

231
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:54,608
If you don't mind, the bosses
should be appearing soon.

232
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,903
Excuse me, then.

233
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,363
Hold it right there!

234
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,658
COULDN'T HELP IT…

235
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,872
That figures. You've already forgotten.

236
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,125
{\an8}It's me, Akane. The one you helped
at the online game event.

237
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:15,295
{\an8}Oh, the lady who got wasted
and threw up in my room.

238
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,964
I really am sorry about that!

239
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:19,549
No, wait…

240
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,218
Wasn't he a bit rude?

241
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,303
She was obviously trying to ask you out.

242
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,140
Couldn't you let her finish?

243
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:29,518
I…

244
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,394
was being asked out?

245
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:35,649
You know…

246
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:39,027
you'd be better off learning about
people's emotions than video games.

247
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,278
I'm often told that.

248
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:45,700
-So you're a high school student, huh?
-Yeah.

249
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:49,955
That's why you only
ordered soft drinks at the <i>izakaya.</i>

250
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,206
Yeah.

251
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,499
What year are you?

252
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:53,458
I'm a senior.

253
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,003
<i>Hey, he's wearing the uniform</i>
<i>for Tosei Academy.</i>

254
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:58,713
<i>That means he's smart.</i>

255
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,466
<i>That school is a nightmare to get into.</i>

256
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,347
Actually…

257
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,016
I was hoping to meet you again.

258
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,192
Sorry.

259
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,820
I found it later,

260
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,029
but I had stepped on it.

261
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,615
<i>The heart…</i>

262
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,200
<i>split cleanly in two.</i>

263
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,250
Thank you for taking the time.

264
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,335
Have you been carrying it since then?

265
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,921
You mentioned we use
the same train station.

266
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,048
I thought I might run into you.

267
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,593
I guess I should have logged in, huh?

268
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,052
It must have been a pain.

269
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,095
No.

270
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,182
{\an8}Well, thanks!

271
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,185
{\an8}I was gonna throw it out,
anyway, so don't worry.

272
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,687
I'm off then.

273
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,032
Excuse me…

274
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,418
Here… please take it.

275
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,629
I don't need it back.

276
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,928
Now, if you don't mind…

277
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,814
<i>Here's the forecast for the Kanto area.</i>
<i>Yesterday's rain moved north,</i>

278
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,274
<i>so today will be sunny.</i>

279
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,318
<i>Tonight will offer a clear view</i>
<i>of the moon.</i>

280
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,862
<i>Here… please take it.</i>

281
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,201
<i>I was gonna throw it out, anyway,</i>

282
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,494
<i>so don't worry.</i>

283
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:04,839
Coming!

284
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,469
{\an8}TAGAWA EXPRESS MOVING COMPANY

285
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,263
{\an8}-Hello, you have a delivery!
-Hello, you have a delivery!

286
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:15,392
The sender is "Ms. Kinoshita."

287
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,394
We'll carry them inside!

288
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,521
Thanks for your business!

289
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,781
<i>"Dear Akane, I'm turning your bedroom</i>

294
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,626
Why'd you call me?

295
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:42,669
I JUST GOT HOME FROM WORK

296
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,671
You've gotta help me, Momo!

297
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,007
I can't even walk in here.

298
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,634
My mom sent my things from home.

299
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,386
Just look at all this stuff!

300
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,971
What do I do?!

301
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,725
I'm exhausted. Everything goes.

302
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,270
{\an8}Starting with that huge teddy--

303
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,355
{\an8}Wait! That's a memento.

304
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,566
{\an8}-It's from my grandmother--
-Shut up!

305
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,318
-My Grandma's--
-There, next!

306
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:09,946
Next!

307
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,997
Akane!

308
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,875
These two things are in the way.

309
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,836
What do I do with them?

310
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,797
The umbrella's new, so it can be used,

311
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:28,715
but the necklace is broken.

312
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,967
Can I throw it out?

313
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:35,555
<i>Please be more selective.</i>

314
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,308
<i>Storage space is limited.</i>

315
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:48,568
-"Be selective"…
-Huh?

316
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:49,694
CAREFUL, I'LL THROW THEM BOTH OUT

317
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,531
<i>No matter how precious,</i>

318
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,785
<i>I can't hang on to everything.</i>

319
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:57,744
COMBUSTIBLES - NON-COMBUSTIBLES

320
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,709
So, in the end…

321
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,920
you're keeping that one?

322
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:10,673
Even so…

323
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,884
I'm discarding everything else.

324
00:18:14,177 --> 00:18:15,095
After all…

325
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,388
I don't need it anymore.

326
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:25,814
{\an8}THERE, THERE.

327
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,398
Okay!

328
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,943
Let's cut loose and get some <i>yakiniku!</i>

329
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,736
Your treat, of course.

330
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,904
Cash flow is tight.

331
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,323
Please go easy on me.

332
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,264
-Yes?
-Yamada!

333
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,100
I came to return your umbrella!

334
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,268
Oh, man.

335
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,020
He really is hot!

336
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,690
The name's Momo.

337
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,651
So nice to meet you, Yamada-kun!

338
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,486
GRR…

339
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,904
Here you are!

340
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,034
Huh? Something wrong?

341
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,244
Um…

342
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,996
I can't find the words.

343
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,039
Yamada-kun!

344
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:28,418
I'm sorry Akane's
always causing you trouble.

345
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,669
However…

346
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,380
If you'll have me,
let's take this opportunity

347
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,884
and marry with the intention of dating!

348
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,888
I won't hesitate to call the police.

349
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:40,680
SHE REEKS OF ALCOHOL…

350
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,266
I told you I didn't need it back.

351
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,976
In fact, it's a nuisance.

352
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,519
Well, you see…

353
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:51,566
It's not just the umbrella.

354
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:52,734
I also…

355
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,112
wanted to thank you!

356
00:19:57,906 --> 00:19:59,240
On the day of that event,

357
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,868
I'm really glad you were there.

358
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,163
<i>Had I been alone…</i>

359
00:20:05,747 --> 00:20:07,749
<i>I would have really had it rough.</i>

360
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,793
<i>So, truly…</i>

361
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,837
<i>Are you okay?</i>

362
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:14,964
<i>Thank you!</i>

363
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:19,427
Oh.

364
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:25,516
Bye, then!

365
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,894
We'll head home
before you call the police!

366
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,145
Please do.

367
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:32,857
Momo, time to go home!

368
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,362
Walk with me now!

369
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:39,864
I'll walk.

370
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,913
ROOM 101: YAMADA

371
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:50,041
Momo, better watch your step!

372
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,627
Watch step…

373
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,380
By the way…

374
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,468
Ruri…

375
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,930
The Guild Master was worried about you.

376
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,726
She said you hadn't logged in since then.

377
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:13,731
So…

378
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:18,444
If you… have the chance…

379
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:22,782
I will!

380
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,200
I'll login.

381
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,952
Right when I get home!

382
00:21:26,035 --> 00:21:26,995
Will you too, Yamada?

383
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,621
No, I'm going to bed.

384
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:29,747
You won't?

385
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,749
-Sleep.
-You really won't?

386
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:35,003
I will… marry you.

387
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,062
They multiplied…

388
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,147
What should we do, Yamada?

389
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,025
Yamada?

390
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,277
Yoo-hoo!

391
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,196
Yamada?

392
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,031
Hey, what's wrong?

393
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:28,658
Yamada?

394
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,909
Yamada!

395
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:34,413
Yamada!

396
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,290
AKANE: YAMADA!
YAMADA: ZZZZZZZ

397
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,002
