Wow, look at all these posters!

6
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,869
And the opening video
is playing over there!

7
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,412
{\an8}Hey, Eita…

8
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,331
{\an8}The menu is neat too.

9
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:23,626
{\an8}Each of the dishes
has a dungeon boss's name.

10
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,378
{\an8}Some of these bring back memories.

11
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:28,464
{\an8}You're too fast, Mr. Kamota.

12
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,965
Let me see!

13
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,009
The food actually looks good!

14
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,470
-What'll you have?
<i>-Uh-oh…</i>

15
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,348
<i>I know Yamada and Princess Ruri,</i>

16
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:40,559
<i>but who are the old man</i>
<i>and the guy in glasses?</i>

17
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:41,769
More nostalgia!

18
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:44,730
{\an8}Do you like spicy foods, Eita?

19
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,232
{\an8}If I had to choose…

20
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,483
{\an8}I have more of a sweet-tooth!

21
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,778
<i>They're really enjoying themselves.</i>

22
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,488
Princess Ruri?

23
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,907
{\an8}Who are those two?

24
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,283
{\an8}They're guild members, right?

25
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,037
That's Mr. Kamota and Eita.

26
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,791
Um, a little more information
would be helpful.

27
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,419
And another thing, my character

28
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,671
isn't Princess Ruri.

29
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:14,385
So the real question is, who are you?

30
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:29,024
ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

31
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,689
<i>Um… "Who am I?"</i>

32
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:53,150
What's your deal?

33
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,861
Why are you here at our guild meeting?

34
00:03:56,779 --> 00:03:57,780
Wait…

35
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,032
You are Princess Ruri, aren't you?

36
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,326
-I keep telling you that I'm not.
-But…

37
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,119
I'll ask you again.

38
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,704
Who are you?

39
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,332
Wait a minute…

40
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,501
Where is Princess Ruri then?

41
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,753
-Princess Ruri!
-Look--

42
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,879
Eita…

43
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,714
Before ordering,

44
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:18,592
shouldn't you introduce yourselves?

45
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,510
EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GOOD

46
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,095
Oh, you're right.

47
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,721
Sorry, Akane.

48
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,974
Let's start over.

49
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,977
I'm Eita Sasaki, age 19.

50
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,645
My hobby is online gaming.

51
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,981
I play Princess Ruri online.

52
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:33,941
Pleased to meet you,

53
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,818
Akane!

54
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,241
-Ne…
<i>-What's a</i> nekama, <i>you ask?</i>

55
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,867
It refers to a man who uses

56
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,537
the anonymity of social networks

57
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,789
to act as a woman online

58
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,834
or the engagement in such behavior.

59
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,169
In fact, this term has been around

60
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:58,465
among PC users
since before the spread of the Internet.

61
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,842
You're a <i>ne… ka…</i>

62
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,719
You've got the wrong idea.

63
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,762
I'm merely a vessel for a muse

64
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:06,473
who has descended into our digital waters.

65
00:05:06,557 --> 00:05:08,559
In other words, Princess Rui and I

66
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,728
are different entities
but one and the same!

67
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,563
Such a special state of affairs

68
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,733
should never be reduced
to a cheap term like <i>nekama.</i>

69
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,860
It's not that simple.

70
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,778
In the two-dimensional world,
you could say

71
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,947
Princess Ruri and I are bound by fate.

72
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,199
She is my goddess, my mother,

73
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,868
my wife, and my alter-ego.

74
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,703
Whenever a man plays a female character,

75
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:30,664
everyone starts shouting
<i>nekama</i> this, <i>nekama</i> that,

76
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:34,501
-but they just don't understand.
-Eita!

77
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,503
Compared to that…

78
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,255
-Ruri and I are more creative--
-Eita!

79
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,465
RURI WAS A MAN…

80
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,550
You're not reading the room.

81
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,178
I gave you my phone number

82
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,263
and even told you about my breakup!

83
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,223
Calm down, Akane.

84
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,516
There's no need to worry.

85
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,477
You didn't tell me, you told Ruri.

86
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,394
Makes no sense!

87
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,020
UH-OH…

88
00:05:53,103 --> 00:05:54,188
Um…

89
00:05:54,271 --> 00:05:56,398
I'm Takeza Kamota.

90
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:57,649
My character

91
00:05:57,733 --> 00:06:00,652
is named Takezo.

92
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:03,572
Normally, I hunt for plunder
in the dungeons,

93
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,741
so you've never met me in character.

94
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:08,577
And this young lady is Runa.

95
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,704
She's Eita's little sister

96
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,457
and the model for Ruri.

97
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,503
Making your little sister
the model is creepy, isn't it?

98
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,424
{\an8}And this is Akito Yamada.

99
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:25,844
{\an8}But you already know each other, right?

100
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,889
What? What do you mean
they know each other?

101
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,516
{\an8}What is he to you?

102
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,392
{\an8}How could you possibly know each other?

103
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:35,687
{\an8}That's um…

104
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,481
STARE

105
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,817
I'd rather not explain.

106
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,818
It's a long story.

107
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,735
{\an8}I can explain!

108
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,987
{\an8}We merely met at an event!

109
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,740
In simple terms, that's it.

110
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:51,578
<i>It was hard not to notice, but…</i>

111
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,667
{\an8}THIS WOMAN… SUCH AN EYESORE…

112
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,294
{\an8}<i>This girl really doesn't like me!</i>

113
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,132
Well…

114
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,384
I see.

115
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:08,178
{\an8}The people I met in the game

116
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,514
{\an8}were Eita and Yamada.

117
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,808
You were always flirting,

118
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,685
so I thought you were a couple!

119
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,020
He's my neighborhood <i>senpai.</i>

120
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,897
When he's in full character,

121
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:20,649
I have to play along.

122
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,651
{\an8}Yamada!

123
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,652
{\an8}FLIRTING X
HIERARCHY ✓

124
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,155
{\an8}<i>-Flirty, flirty…</i>
-Senpai's orders.

125
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,907
I see. That must be rough.

126
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,915
You told me before
that you didn't have a girlfriend.

127
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,042
I thought you might be lying.

128
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,755
I wouldn't lie about something like that.

129
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,134
Right… I'm glad.

130
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:51,472
<i>Huh?</i>

131
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,727
<i>Did I really just say that?</i>

132
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,605
"You're glad"?

133
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,319
You said, "You're glad."

134
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,863
So what exactly…

135
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,574
are you glad about?

136
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,287
Does that mean…

137
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,458
you like Yamada or something?

138
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,712
Th… that's not what--

139
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,464
I'm sorry, Akane.

140
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,674
My little sister is very territorial

141
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,510
and going through a rebellious phase.

142
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,094
She can be hard to deal with.

143
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,347
This won't do, Runa.

144
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,351
-You can't talk like that to an older--
-No, it's fine!

145
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,145
At this rate, you'll never
make it in grownup society.

146
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:41,563
Back off, <i>Nekama.</i>

147
00:08:41,647 --> 00:08:44,024
I'm not a <i>nekama!</i> I'm just a romantic!

148
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,068
-Stuff it.
-Please don't fight!

149
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,986
So, um… food…

150
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,030
Does everyone know what they want?

151
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,074
What'll it be for me?

152
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,952
<i>That was a surprise.</i>

153
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,887
{\an8}We should probably call for--

154
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,183
Akane, are you okay?

155
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,103
{\an8}I'm so sorry. It slipped from my hand.

156
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,313
{\an8}Are you hurt? Let's call the staff.

157
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,399
It's fine. I'll do it--

158
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,072
It's too dangerous.

159
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,032
Better let the staff do it.

160
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,539
Right…

161
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,459
Excuse me!

162
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,753
I'm afraid we broke a glass.

163
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,464
<i>Oh, man…</i>

164
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,466
<i>I wasn't…</i>

165
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,884
<i>prepared for that.</i>

166
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,721
<i>What do I do?</i>

167
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,806
<i>I'm probably still blushing.</i>

168
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,642
<i>Should I flee to the restroom?</i>

169
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,144
<i>Or would that be too obvious?</i>

170
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,397
<i>Either way, I have to calm down.</i>

171
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:07,482
Excuse me, everyone.

172
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,109
I have a phone call.

173
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,444
Sure.

174
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,653
What about food?

175
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,196
We'll order for you.

176
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,198
Please order without me.

177
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,457
Thank goodness.

178
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,167
Are you okay?

179
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,376
Uh, yeah.

180
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,213
Um, I'll go pick some flowers.

181
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,840
<i>You really are Princess Ruri.</i>

182
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,801
<i>She's still glaring at me!</i>

183
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,304
Enjoy your meal.

184
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,640
Thank you very much.

185
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:40,849
Are you okay now?

186
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,477
Yes. Sorry for the commotion.

187
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,854
I'm just glad you're not hurt.

188
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,439
Thank you very much!

189
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,816
<i>Mr. Tamota is really nice!</i>

190
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,820
We heard that this would be
your first offline meeting,

191
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,656
so we were really excited.

192
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,824
No one told me and I'm not excited.

193
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,620
Have you all known each other
for a long time?

194
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,248
We knew one another
from the previous game we played.

195
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,293
{\an8}We started playing FOS
after being invited by Eita.

196
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:12,631
Runa never logs in though.
Once every three months, maybe--

197
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,007
<i>I see.</i>

198
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:16,635
<i>Other than me, everyone's acquainted.</i>

199
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,806
{\an8}Eita said there was a wonderful girl
that we should all meet.

200
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,058
{\an8}He was very insistent.

201
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,352
You're after my brother too?!

202
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:26,561
I'm not "after" anyone!

203
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:34,569
I thought you weren't a liar?

204
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,072
The phone call is definitely a lie.

205
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,202
What's up?

206
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:44,413
I just had a feeling

207
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:48,667
that I should remove myself
from her sight.

208
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,627
<i>Don't come near me.</i>

209
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,838
She had that aura.

210
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,465
So that's your interpretation.

211
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,634
I think what Runa said

212
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,970
must have really upset her.

213
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:03,306
Actually, I think
she was just embarrassed.

214
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:04,891
Embarrassed about what?

215
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,101
Don't make me say it.

216
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,895
If you don't, I won't get it.

217
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,731
You've always been like that.

218
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,358
But whatever.

219
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:17,487
Anyway, the real Akane turned out
to be a beautiful older lady.

220
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,364
You said she was just like her character,

221
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,992
so I thought she would be more childish.

222
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:24,286
<i>Yamada!</i>

223
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:25,203
<i>Yamada!</i>

224
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,246
-<i>Yamada!</i>
-<i>Yamada!</i>

225
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,749
They're exactly alike.

226
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,502
Come on, she's nothing like her character!

227
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,628
You think?

228
00:12:33,712 --> 00:12:37,132
Most of the women on FOS
have child-like looks.

229
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,635
I can't tell one woman from another.

230
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,679
You'll never have a girlfriend

231
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,223
if you keep talking like that.

232
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,644
Isn't it about time you stopped

233
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,521
making fun of me for being single?

234
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,732
It used to be just for fun,

235
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,525
but these days, I'm sincerely worried.

236
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:00,614
Your lack of interest in women
has gone to the extreme.

237
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:15,587
<i>You just felt sorry for me?</i>

238
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:32,854
<i>Is that true?</i>

239
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,698
<i>Goodbye.</i>

240
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,668
Thank you very much!

241
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:57,212
Thanks for coming, everyone!

242
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,964
We have a guild battle tonight,

243
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,466
so I'll see you all online!

244
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,926
-Okay!
-Okay!

245
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,929
Sorry I can't walk you home, Akane!

246
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,181
If only I didn't have to work tonight.

247
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,641
You already got lost earlier.

248
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,892
Ruri's worried about you!

249
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,185
I'll be fine.

250
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,022
What's the matter, Runa?

251
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:17,440
You've got a scary look.

252
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,151
I don't like that girl.

253
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,905
She's all over Yamada and my brother.

254
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,949
I'll bet she's a tramp.

255
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,492
Oh my, Runa!

256
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:29,452
Where did you learn to talk like that?

257
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,539
It's always been the four of us.

258
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,375
Why do we have to add her now?

259
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,544
Whatever it takes,

260
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,922
I'm going to push her out of the guild.

261
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:51,808
Since we're traveling the same way,
let's go home together!

262
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,896
<i>I managed to get that far,</i>

263
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,064
<i>but conversation is at a standstill.</i>

264
00:14:58,148 --> 00:15:00,901
-Say, Yamada…
-Yeah?

265
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,779
-Do you guys often get together like this?
-Yeah.

266
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,490
Wow, so you're all good friends!

267
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,408
Yeah.

268
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,534
Now that you mention it…

269
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,537
-Eita's a fun guy to know, huh?
-Yeah.

270
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,039
THE END

271
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,291
-MY NEIGHBOR BUILT A FENCE, RECENTLY
-YEAH?

272
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,301
SNEAKING GLANCES

273
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,850
That hurt…

274
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,143
Are you okay?

275
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,519
Sorry.

276
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,605
You should change places with me.

277
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,650
-That wouldn't be fair.
-It's fine.

278
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,068
Thanks.

279
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:51,493
<i>So it was him.</i>

280
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,827
<i>I was a bit startled.</i>

281
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,121
<i>I thought everyone was staring at me.</i>

282
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:56,164
THIS IS EMBARRASSING

283
00:15:57,374 --> 00:16:00,919
<i>Well, I did find him</i>
<i>strikingly handsome at first too.</i>

284
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,839
<i>Do you like Yamada or something?</i>

285
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,970
<i>Did it look that way to her?</i>

286
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:11,096
<i>This won't do!</i>

287
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,306
<i>Yamada's an important</i>
<i>online gaming friend.</i>

288
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,518
{\an8}Oh, that reminds me.
What will you eat for dinner?

289
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,603
{\an8}I'm not very hungry.

290
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,688
{\an8}Are you sure?

291
00:16:19,771 --> 00:16:20,605
{\an8}Pudding, maybe?

292
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:21,606
{\an8}ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT CONVERSATION

293
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,941
{\an8}Come on!

294
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,442
PUDDING

295
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,070
That'll be 128 yen!

296
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,781
Thank you very much!

297
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,076
Uh… you mean you were serious?

298
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,160
Yeah.

299
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,289
-Do you live alone, Yamada?
-Yeah.

300
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,749
Do you cook for yourself?

301
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,084
Never.

302
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,963
So what do you do for meals every day?

303
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,340
I just buy something
from the convenience store.

304
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,595
<i>He's a high school student, isn't he?</i>

305
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,100
<i>Doesn't his mother have anything to say?</i>

306
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,104
<i>Well, I shouldn't ask about</i>
<i>people's family lives.</i>

307
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:05,859
Yamada!

308
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,610
-Do you have a moment?
-Yeah.

309
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,612
I only need 15, no ten minutes!

310
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,073
Just wait here for ten minutes!
I'll be right back!

311
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,631
<i>Ten minutes…</i>

312
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:32,302
<i>She seemed so upset just a while ago.</i>

313
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,681
<i>Yamada, it's been a while!</i>

314
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,145
<i>She sure does recover fast.</i>

315
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,713
Yamada!

316
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:14,302
Sorry to keep you waiting!

317
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,303
Huh?

318
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:23,269
-Are you okay?
-Wow…

319
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,231
I haven't run like that since high school.

320
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,318
What's all that stuff you're carrying?

321
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,654
This is… curry!

322
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,366
You probably don't boil your own rice,

323
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,618
so I brought some I kept frozen.

324
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:41,371
I made the curry this morning,

325
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,373
so it should last for two days.

326
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,708
I'm really short on money this month,

327
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,502
so there's not much meat.

328
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,337
But you can have

329
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:52,715
the salad and pickled vegetables
I bought at the convenience store.

330
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,259
Wait, I…

331
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,427
I can't accept them.

332
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,846
You're short on money, right?

333
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,347
If you don't eat right,

334
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,473
{\an8}you won't grow.

335
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:01,891
{\an8}Well, um…

336
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,310
Pudding is only for dessert!

337
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,895
I know that, but…

338
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:08,898
Just consider it as looking out
for a fellow guild member.

339
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,400
But…

340
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,196
Your phone is ringing.

341
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,531
Oh, it's mine?

342
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,199
I wonder who it is.

343
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,534
Momo, maybe?

344
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:24,706
Huh? It's an unknown number.

345
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,375
Yes? Hello?

346
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:28,459
SMELLING THE CURRY…

347
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:31,963
This is…

348
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,382
<i>Runa.</i>

349
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,220
Runa? Oh my, what is it?

350
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:42,265
<i>My brother gave me your number.</i>

351
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:43,933
<i>Sorry to call, so suddenly.</i>

352
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:44,976
It's totally fine!

353
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,188
<i>You came all the way to meet us today.</i>

354
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,065
<i>I'm sorry I was so rude.</i>

355
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,484
<i>My brother told me to apologize.</i>

356
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,446
It doesn't bother me at all.

357
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,240
Everyone gets nervous
meeting people for the first time.

358
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:01,326
Anyway…

359
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,911
if you don't mind,

360
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,996
I'd like to hang out with you again.

361
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:10,543
<i>This time, I'd like to actually</i>
<i>get to know you.</i>

362
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:12,378
Runa…

363
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:17,675
Sure!

364
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:20,136
Next Saturday, huh?

365
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,429
Sounds good.

366
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,014
Yeah!

367
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,016
I'm excited too!

368
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,185
Bye then!

369
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:30,021
Runa wants to hang out with me!

370
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,689
Yeah, I overheard.

371
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:34,943
I thought for sure she didn't like me.

372
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:36,444
I'm glad.

373
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,948
I wonder what her character
is like in-game?

374
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,824
-Do you know, Yamada?
-A little.

375
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,910
What class does she play?

376
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,370
I'll bet she's a mage.

377
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,996
I'd like to see her character!

378
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,540
I wonder what her level is.

379
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,168
<i>Good for you.</i>

380
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,755
<i>Yeah. I'll add her number to my phone!</i>

381
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,769
<i>She said Saturday, didn't she?</i>

382
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,771

<i>Right?</i>

386
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:24,617
<i>Maybe I heard wrong.</i>

387
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:01,422

00:23:03,716 --> 00:23:06,928
{\an8}First up is the "Alice with flowers
and pocket watch" set!

390
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,347
{\an8}It's quite a popular avatar.

391
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,890
{\an8}I wear it once in a while!

392
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:14,393
{\an8}Next is the "Priest's
Sacred Robes, ultimate version."

your armor will be exposed!

{\an8}Next is the "Red Rose for a Queen" set.

395
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:22,944
{\an8}It's gorgeous,

396
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:25,154
{\an8}but I don't wear it that often.

397
00:23:25,238 --> 00:23:27,490
{\an8}Last but not least… my go-to!

398
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,784
{\an8}I love this one
because it raises my attributes!

399
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,954
Thanks for watching, everyone!
