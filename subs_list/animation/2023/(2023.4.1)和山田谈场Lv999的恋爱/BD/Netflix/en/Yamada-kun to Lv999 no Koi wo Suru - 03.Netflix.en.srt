1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,673
You're single, Ms. Kinoshita?

2
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:07,425
{\an8}Uh, yeah.

3
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,260
How about me, then?

4
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:11,220
I come with lots of amenities.

5
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,268
Oh, yeah?

6
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,061
That's so funny!

7
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:21,814
WHAT?

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:24,817
I WANT OUT OF HERE

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,318
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT

10
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:27,319
GRIN - GRIN

11
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,530
<i>I set this blind date up for you.</i>

12
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,949
<i>Sorry, I'm not ready, after all.</i>

13
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:32,867
<i>I wanna go home.</i>

14
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,077
{\an8}THE FEMALE ABILITY
TO CONVERSE THROUGH GAZE

15
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,330
Ms. Kinoshita,

16
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,041
you seem really into that game.

17
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,500
What's it called?

18
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,502
I play mobile games too.

19
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:45,254
Why don't we play together?

20
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,798
Um, it's not a mobile game.

21
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:51,343
It's a PC game called Forest of Savior.

22
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,180
Oh, right…

23
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,057
Fore…

24
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:00,061
I think I've seen the TV commercial.

25
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,522
It's uh… yeah…

26
00:01:03,606 --> 00:01:05,900
-I saw the commercial!
<i>-Sorry about this.</i>

27
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,359
No, wait, I mean…

28
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:09,445
I remember now!

29
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,905
Forest, yeah.

30
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:12,364
Savior, yeah.

31
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:27,004
ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

32
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:44,790
Unbelievable…

33
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:46,417
Were you even trying?

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,210
This was your chance to meet someone,

35
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,962
and you couldn't put your phone down!

36
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,797
Are you even trying?

37
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:52,882
Sorry.

38
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:55,342
Ruri was messaging me,
and I wanted to reply.

39
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:56,802
Ruri?

40
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:58,804
My friend from the online game.

41
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:02,516
She's a girl with this really cute avatar.

42
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,101
A girl?

43
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,565
What'll you do if she's really an old man?

44
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,234
It's risky giving out
your cell phone number.

45
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,155
I'm pretty sure it's a girl.

46
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,282
Whatever.

47
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,659
Anyway, I'm headed this way.

48
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,585
<i>Come to think of it…</i>

49
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:32,504
<i>I never gave it any thought.</i>

50
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,927
MY DINNER'S DONE. I'LL LOGIN AT HOME!

51
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,014
RURI WILL BE HOME SOON TOO.
LET'S HAVE FUN TOGETHER WHEN YOU LOGIN.

52
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:46,018
<i>In my imagination,</i>
<i>she's a girl around high school age.</i>

53
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,901
<i>I wonder what she's really like.</i>

54
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,992
<i>Wow, is that gothic Lolita fashion?</i>

55
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,119
<i>Or is it more like</i>
<i>the cute fairytale type?</i>

56
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,248
CAN'T TELL THESE DAYS

57
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,540
<i>Somehow…</i>

58
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,210
<i>She reminded me of Princess Ruri.</i>

59
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,588
<i>All right…</i>

60
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:16,507
<i>I only have afternoon classes tomorrow,</i>

61
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,842
<i>so I can really enjoy the game tonight.</i>

62
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:28,477
WONDERS WHY SHE'S MORE
EXCITED FOR THIS THAN HER BLIND DATE

63
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,980
Well, it's no big deal.

64
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,731
GAVE UP THINKING ABOUT IT

65
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:36,777
<i>I'm just not in the mood</i>
<i>for another romance yet.</i>

66
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:39,989
SYSTEM: AKANE HAS LOGGED IN

67
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,824
<i>Huh?</i>

68
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,537
<i>There's no one in the guild room.</i>

69
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,585
<i>Oh, it's Princess Ruri and Yamada!</i>

70
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,755
<i>What are they up to?</i>

71
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,508
<i>Maybe the three of us can go hunting.</i>

72
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,510
<i>Let's see…</i>

73
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,638
RURI: THERE ARE NO GUILD MEMBERS
ONLINE TODAY.

74
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,015
HERE'S ONE.

75
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,516
RURI: KINDA LONELY.
AKANE'S NOT HERE EITHER…

76
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,393
YAMADA: WELL, IT IS A WEEKDAY.

77
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,644
RURI: SHE SAID SHE WOULD COME THOUGH.

78
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,688
<i>Huh?</i>

79
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:17,484
<i>I guess they haven't noticed I'm here?</i>

80
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,863
THIS REMINDS ME OF WHEN THE GUILD STARTED

81
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:25,034
This reminds me of when the guild started.

82
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:26,952
Yeah.

83
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,497
It was just the two of us
every day, back then.

84
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,835
We have a lot of members now,

85
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,295
but sometimes…

86
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,505
it's nice being just the two of us.

87
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,009
On one hand, there are
more people to share with

88
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,387
and on the other,
I have less time alone with you.

89
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,765
Ruri's been missing that.

90
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,518
Well,

91
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,771
a lot of things were easier

92
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,856
when it was the two of us.

93
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,901
<i>Th…</i>

94
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,361
<i>These two are…</i>

95
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,698
{\an8}<i>-An item!</i>
-It's ready.

96
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,657
{\an8}FINDING IT HARD TO INTERRUPT

97
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,076
{\an8}Wow, thanks!

98
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,620
{\an8}Alchemy is such a cool skill to have!

99
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,247
Maybe Ruri should learn it too.

100
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,416
By the way,

101
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,336
we're not the only guild members here.

102
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,089
Oh, it's Akane!

103
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:23,008
I missed the system log entry.

104
00:06:23,092 --> 00:06:25,177
Sorry, Akane!

105
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,346
AKANE: THANKS… BUT AM I BUTTING IN?

106
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,349
Not at all!

107
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,852
GRIN - GRIN

108
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,106
Anyway, I have other plans,
so gotta log out.

109
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:38,524
Okay!

110
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,691
I'll phone you later.

111
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:40,859
<i>-Phone?</i>
-Right.

112
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,363
SYSTEM: YAMADA HAS LOGGED OUT

113
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,369
<i>Now that you mention it…</i>

114
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,206
<i>Yamada barely interacts</i>
<i>with everyone else,</i>

115
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,000
<i>but he does talk to Princess Ruri a lot.</i>

116
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:01,255
<i>Could it be they're…</i>

117
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,966
<i>boyfriend and girlfriend?</i>

118
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,845
<i>Like when Takuma and I</i>
<i>started playing the game together.</i>

119
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,305
<i>Maybe Yamada and Princess Ruri…</i>

120
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,394
Akane?

121
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:17,896
Is something wrong?

122
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,273
Not at all!

123
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,195
<i>Why am I…</i>

124
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,534
<i>feeling down all of a sudden?</i>

125
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,208
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!

126
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,168
TALK TO YOU LATER!

127
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,169
YOU'RE THE BEST!

128
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:51,847
YEAH, LATER

129
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,351
<i>Why am I so hung up on those two?</i>

130
00:07:56,435 --> 00:08:01,190
The "Arab Spring" began in Northern Africa
and swept through Arab countries.

131
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,817
The power of people
to connect on social media

132
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,777
formed the background.

133
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:10,365
{\an8}As this example shows, social media

134
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:13,577
is capable of building new connections.

135
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,537
<i>Yamada's account…</i>

136
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,956
<i>I'd like to take a peek.</i>

137
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:19,625
<i>But then…</i>

138
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,463
<i>it sort of feels like I'd be prying.</i>

139
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,341
Ms. Kinoshita!

140
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:29,676
Over here!

141
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,554
<i>It's the guy from that blind date.</i>

142
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,139
<i>What was his name, again?</i>

143
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,018
You had the same lecture as me, huh?

144
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:41,313
-I saw you playing with your phone.
-No way!

145
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:42,940
I didn't notice.

146
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,900
<i>His name… what's his name…</i>

147
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,902
<i>It's no good. I can't remember.</i>

148
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:49,821
By the way,

149
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:52,783
I looked up Forest of Savior
after our dinner.

150
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,035
It's pretty popular, huh?

151
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,370
So I've heard.

152
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,580
I had the urge to try it too.

153
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:00,999
I like video games, after all.

154
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,960
<i>There sure are a lot of gamer guys.</i>

155
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,253
YAMADA, PRO GAMER

156
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,756
Do you play FPS too?

157
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,799
"F?"

158
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,051
Do you know a pro gamer named Yamada?

159
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,680
Uh, Yamada… yeah.

160
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,306
I, uh…

161
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,769
-I may have seen him in a commercial!
<i>-Sorry again.</i>

162
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,565
You really are into games, aren't you?

163
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,024
<i>What is this…?</i>

164
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:29,361
<i>I have this vaguely uneasy feeling.</i>

165
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:34,074
And so, when summer arrives,

166
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,077
our circle is talking about
going to Okinawa.

167
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,787
Yeah? That sounds fun.

168
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,205
It will be!

169
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,874
Our members all know
how to have a good time.

170
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,877
-Why don't you join us?
<i>-Huh?</i>

171
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,714
<i>That girl…</i>

172
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,633
<i>Haven't I seen her before?</i>

173
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:56,930
Sorry I'm late.

174
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,101
Let's go.

175
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,151
The hotel we book regularly
has an ocean view!

176
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:14,656
<i>I've never had a girlfriend.</i>

177
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:18,910
<i>Well…</i>

178
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,787
<i>Yamada is handsome.</i>

179
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,790
<i>I was sure he must have had</i>

180
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,960
<i>a girlfriend or two, at least.</i>

181
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,963
Ms. Kinoshita?

182
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,634
Sorry, I'm headed this way.

183
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,552
-Ms. Kinoshita--
-See you on campus!

184
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,056
<i>So why…?</i>

185
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,560
<i>Why do I feel so uneasy?</i>

186
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,048
<i>I think I'll skip logging in today.</i>

187
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,010
<i>Who's that?</i>

188
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:18,678
<i>Momo, maybe?</i>

189
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,390
HI THERE, AKANE! ARE YOU FREE?

190
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,933
<i>It's Princess Ruri.</i>

191
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,394
<i>What do I do?</i>

192
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,855
<i>I'm not in the mood for gaming today.</i>

193
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,650
HI THERE RURI, WHAT'S UP?

194
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,193
AKANE, DID YOU READ THE FOS NEWS?

195
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,195
<i>FOS News?</i>

196
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,449
<i>I haven't logged in today,</i>
<i>so I don't know about it.</i>

197
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,454
THEY'RE OPENING A FOS COLLABORATIVE CAFE
NEXT MONTH. WANNA GO TOGETHER?

198
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,039
<i>A collaborative cafe?</i>

199
00:11:46,123 --> 00:11:49,376
OH, AND I RAN INTO YAMADA IRL AND INVITED
HIM TOO! AND THE OTHER MEMBERS!

200
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,044
<i>"Ran into him IRL…"</i>

201
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,881
<i>Could it be…</i>

202
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,801
<i>That girl really is Princess Ruri?</i>

203
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:04,558
<i>I did get the same kind of vibe from her.</i>

204
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:09,813
<i>But then, those two really are…</i>

205
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,401
RURI WOULD LOVE TO MEET OFFLINE!
CAN YOU COME?

206
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,736
P-L-E-A-S-E!

207
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,748
OKAY, I'LL GO

208
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,647
GOOD MORNING, AKANE

209
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,232
TODAY'S THE DAY!

210
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:55,734
I'M SO EXCITED I COULD BARELY SLEEP!

211
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,746
<i>Well, I guess I'll get ready.</i>

212
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,752
<i>I won't get many opportunities</i>
<i>to meet the guild members IRL.</i>

213
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,754
<i>I should enjoy it.</i>

214
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,640
MEETING OFFLINE?

215
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,892
IS THAT SAFE? YOU'VE NEVER
SEEN THEM BEFORE, RIGHT?

216
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,313
IT'S FINE! THEY'RE ALL NICE

217
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,148
AND YAMADA WILL BE THERE TOO!

218
00:13:35,857 --> 00:13:38,026
YAMADA WILL BE THERE? THAT'S A RELIEF

219
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,152
HAVE FUN!

220
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,490
<i>Yeah, let's have fun!</i>

221
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:47,994
<i>Now then…</i>

222
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,123
<i>The Murata building</i>
<i>outside the north exit…</i>

223
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,416
MURATA BUILDING

224
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,294
<i>…will be on your left</i>
<i>when you cross the street.</i>

225
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,464
<i>And then…?</i>

226
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,800
<i>Better check the map again.</i>

227
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,809
{\an8}SOBA RESTAURANT

228
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,159
{\an8}<i>Where is it?</i>

229
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,995
{\an8}FREEZE

230
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:33,957
IN A HURRY…

231
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,500
-Oh, excuse me!
-Not at all!

232
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,836
-It was my fault--
-Let me get that for you.

233
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,588
I hope your phone isn't broken.

234
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:40,505
SORRY…

235
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:47,637
You're going to the FOS cafe?

236
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,561
By any chance…

237
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,980
do you play the game?

238
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:03,945
It's a fairly casual game,

239
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,740
so I heard there were
a lot of girls playing,

240
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,491
but I didn't know there were any

241
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,368
as pretty as you.

242
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:12,037
Come on, I'm not that…

243
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,207
<i>I followed him</i>
<i>because he said he'd lead me there,</i>

244
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,543
<i>but what if this is a new kind of scam?</i>

245
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,711
HE KEEPS COMPLIMENTING ME TOO…

246
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,755
I started playing with a friend,

247
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,506
but I've gotten really into it.

248
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,967
We even started a guild together.

249
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,970
I thought it would be your average MMO,

250
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:32,057
but it actually has
a solid balance of elements.

251
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,225
My favorite feature is how they prevent

252
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,729
characters from over-buffing
through purchases.

253
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:39,981
It's true that the GFX
are a bit out of date,

254
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,233
but the cuteness makes up for it.

255
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:44,945
Best of all, there are no super races.

256
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,988
I enjoy seeing diverse characters

257
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:49,866
and I bet the difference
in classes isn't that big either.

258
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,618
Mages do have a slight advantage now,

259
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,995
but each update leads closer
to perfect balance.

260
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,705
And thanks to guild enhancements,

261
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,207
there's a reason to fight.

262
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,751
The game is built to encourage parties.

263
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,420
It gives meaning to playing together.

264
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:04,422
Of course, leveling up can be
nerve wracking,

265
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:06,675
but it works well
for self-imposed challenges.

266
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:10,261
I really feel like the developer
is listening to users.

267
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:12,847
I can tell they've learned
from their previous mistakes.

268
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:15,016
<i>Phew. He's just your average gamer.</i>

269
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,310
Anyway, that's my take. What's yours?

270
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,520
-What do you think?
-Huh?

271
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,272
Um…

272
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,942
I'm still new to all of this

273
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,361
and I don't know as much as everyone else.

274
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:27,946
I even got in trouble

275
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:31,533
for putting "garbage"
in the guild treasure chest.

276
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,828
But then, the Guild Master is really kind

277
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,372
and I like the group I'm with…

278
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,052
Oh, I think I see him.

279
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:55,056
Hey! Over here!

280
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,058
This way!

281
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,060
It's over here!

282
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,645
<i>Isn't that…</i>

283
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,523
<i>Princess Ruri?</i>

284
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,320
I didn't know you played that game.

285
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,948
-Let's battle, sometime.
-Sure.

286
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,368
Yamada!

287
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,664
Yamada! It's been a while.

288
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:20,790
Long time no see.

289
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,751
-How've you been?
-Same as usual.

290
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,502
Same as usual, huh?

291
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:29,007
STARE

292
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,177
Oh, you're Princess Ruri, aren't you?

293
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,428
Nice to meet you.

294
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,220
HOW CUTE

295
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,972
You look just like your character.

296
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,265
I recognized you right away.

297
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:39,809
Thank you for your message this morning!

298
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,487
<i>Huh?</i>

299
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,116
<i>Her personality seems</i>
<i>a bit different from in the game.</i>

300
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,163
Um…

301
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,874
Hey, Eita.

302
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:03,958
Who is this girl?

303
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,752
If I'm correct…

304
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,464
you're Akane,

305
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,673
aren't you?

306
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,200
Excuse me…

307
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,994
Everyone, why don't we at least go inside?

308
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,210
IZAKAYA BOTTA

309
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,511
Home at last…

310
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,975
My back hurts…

311
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:30,230
How is she so damn heavy?

312
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:31,981
*UNCONSCIOUS PEOPLE ARE ALL HEAVY

313
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,280
I'm beat…

314
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,871
IT'S PRACTICE TIME, BUT YOU'RE OFFLINE?

315
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:47,997
Uh-oh…

316
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:54,003
{\an8}*YAMADA BELONGS TO A PRO FPS TEAM

318
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:02,637
<i>You've kept us all waiting.</i>

319
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,639
Please excuse me. Actually…

320
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:06,516
through a turn of events…

321
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,769
a woman I don't know is asleep in my room.

{\an8}<i>A woman?!</i>

{\an8}<i>"A woman?"</i>

328

{\an8}<i>-Unforgivable…</i>
<i>-He did, right?</i>

329

{\an8}<i>-Show this wayward soul the error of…</i>
<i>-He said "woman"!</i>

330

<i>Hey, photos…</i>

332
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:27,996
<i>I wanna see a photo!</i>

333
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:29,330
<i>I won't spread it anywhere!</i>

334
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,582
<i>I have rather high digital literacy!</i>

335
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,750
Not a chance.

336
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,295
<i>Trust your team members!</i>

337
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,300
I feel sick…

338
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:42,385
<i>Hold to him the mirror</i>

339
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:44,012
<i>that he may see how he has sinned.</i>

340
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,305
I have to step away.

341
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,515
{\an8}<i>Hey, Yamada! Wait!</i>

342
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,727
{\an8}<i>Now I'm pissed off.</i>
<i>I'm gonna slander your account.</i>

343
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,187
{\an8}-Please don't.
<i>-So much for digital literacy.</i>

344

Excuse me…

345
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,568
Are you okay?

346
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,450
Do you need water or anything?

347
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:12,957
Nothing.

348
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,462
After all…

349
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,297
you don't…

350
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:21,716
love me anymore, do you?

351
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,095
Then go…

352
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,598
Hurry up and leave me.

353
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,184
Go!

354
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,103
<i>She says that</i>

355
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,397
<i>while clinging to me…</i>

356
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,608
<i>Isn't that a contradiction?</i>

357
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,777
<i>Or so I thought,</i>

358
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,362
<i>but this seems different, somehow.</i>

359
