00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,010
<i>Yamada? Are you okay?</i>

2
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,471
<i>Your hair hit my eye.</i>

3
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:14,390
<i>Really? Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

4
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,934
Are you okay? Is it stuck in your eye?

5
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:18,185
Show me!

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:19,437
Which eye was it?

7
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:28,821
I'm… fine.

8
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,781
I'm so sorry, Yamada!

9
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:32,658
You apologize too, Runa!

10
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:37,163
I'm so… sorry!

11
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:40,124
I'll tie my hair up, okay?

12
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,167
Um…

13
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,170
I need some things from home.

14
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:49,300
I didn't bring any tools with me.

15
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,509
Oh, but…

16
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:51,927
I'll be right back.

17
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:55,181
All the way home and back?
I don't want to take up--

18
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:56,265
It's fine.

19
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,475
I live nearby.

<i>being bullied.</i>

24
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,263
<i>As long as you're here, Akito.</i>

25
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,559
<i>Will you stay with me forever,</i>

26
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:05,603
<i>even when we're adults?</i>

27
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,737
How could I know that?

28
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,284
<i>Welcome!</i>

29
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,706
Would you like a bag?

30
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,707
Yes.

31
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,210
You buy this often, don't you?

32
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,215
It's good right?
This brand makes good tea.

33
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,883
Oh, yeah.

34
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,844
I like it too.

35
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,183
Thank you, come again!

36
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,645
Excuse me…!

37
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,233
If you don't mind,

38
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,652
could I ask your name?

39
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:56,320
That uniform you wear

40
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,572
is for Tosei Academy, right?

41
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,491
I'm a graduate!

42
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,702
I've been wanting

43
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:07,164
to talk to you at some point.

44
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:10,376
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

45
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,297
Of course you are.

46
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,217
FORGIVE ME…

47
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,637
<i>Why is she making that face?</i>

48
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:24,139
<i>I really am in a hurry</i>

49
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,059
<i>and what would I talk about</i>
<i>with a convenience store employee?</i>

50
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,813
You've always been like that.

51
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,736
<i>I don't get it.</i>

52
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,405
<i>They make no sense.</i>

53
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,784
<i>I should stay away from them.</i>

54
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,340
I'm back.

55
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,055
<i>They're gone?</i>

AFTER-MEAL NAP TIME

58
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,197
<i>They seem to be sleeping happily.</i>

59
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,580
{\an8}<i>I'd better work quietly.</i>

<i>Sorry! I'll tie my hair up, okay?</i>

64
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:55,874
YAMADA

65
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:46,925
Yamada!

66
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:49,386
Huh? Why are you here?

67
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,054
Why… wait!

68
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:54,349
I'm a fan!

69
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,226
<i>I remember this guy.</i>

70
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,145
What are you doing here?

71
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,314
Well… a lot happened.

72
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,273
"A lot" what?!

73
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,817
Give me the details!

74
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:04,818
I'd… rather not.

75
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,196
Don't tell me you and Akane really are--

76
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,489
Let me introduce you

77
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,823
to my new boyfriend.

78
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,074
Not true.

79
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,409
No, that can't be.

80
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,119
No matter how you look at it,

81
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:17,372
Akane clearly put you up to it.

82
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,416
She always puts on a big show.

83
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,001
Plus,

84
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,046
I follow all your social media activity.

85
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,714
Steady the course! No sign of women!

86
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,591
Everything is as it should be!

87
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,719
So don't worry, I haven't
gotten any funny ideas.

88
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,055
Oh, right.

89
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:34,056
Actually,

90
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,599
I came

91
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,309
to return some things.

92
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,937
I don't see her on campus at all

93
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,773
and I have no way of contacting her now.

94
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,318
She made me a lot of box lunches

95
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,903
and other meals,

96
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,989
but I always forgot to return
the dishes and things.

97
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,200
They had piled up quite a bit.

98
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,620
I have five lunch boxes alone.

99
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,747
I figured it'd be bad not to return them.

100
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,332
Shouldn't you have done it earlier?

101
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:04,920
Well, I'm sure she doesn't
want to see my face anymore.

102
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,256
But looking at these as I was cleaning up,

103
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,091
I thought a lot of things over.

104
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,344
<i>I made box lunches for us!</i>

105
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:17,599
I couldn't help but worry
if she's doing okay.

106
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,435
If I could see her smiling,

107
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,104
it would ease my mind.

108
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,574
I think… she's fine.

109
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,371
Is that… what you want to see?

110
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,877
Are you looking for peace of mind?

111
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:51,508
I…

112
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,802
think I'll go.

113
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,307
Sorry for the selfish request.

114
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,519
Please don't tell Akane I was here.

115
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,984
Just act like these lunch boxes
appeared out of nowhere!

116
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:10,569
I'd appreciate it!

117
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,903
Well…

118
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:20,203
I'll be rooting for you
in your next tournament!

119
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,922
SILENCE

120
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:35,427
Um…

121
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,929
<i>How long has she been there?</i>

122
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:40,390
Oh, uh…

123
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:41,933
These lunch boxes…

124
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,102
appeared out of nowhere.

125
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,689
KEEPING HIS PROMISE
EVEN THOUGH SHE CLEARLY KNOWS THE TRUTH

126
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,201
Come on!

127
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,328
Did you really think I'd believe that?

128
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,164
Seeing you say that
with a straight face makes me laugh.

129
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,835
Thanks for handling that.

130
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,386
Excuse me… you can have this back.

131
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,515
Huh?

132
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,642
Now that you mention it, my hair is down.

133
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,935
Yes.

134
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,478
I took it.

135
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,232
I took it.

136
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,900
While you were sleeping…

137
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,782
Is that so?

138
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,284
Yes. I'm sorry.

139
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:42,869
Uh, why did you do that?

140
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:46,790
NOT THAT I MIND…

141
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,085
Well…

142
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,924
Somehow… I just wanted to.

143
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,760
I wonder why.

144
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:03,723
What… are you saying?

145
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,104
It's Eita.

146
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,940
Hello.

147
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,401
Yes.

148
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,946
Then can I tell you what parts I need?

149
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,406
<i>Hang on a second.</i>

150
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,074
<i>I'll write them down.</i>

151
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,868
<i>Let's see…</i>

152
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,456
<i>What was that about?</i>

153
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,835
{\an8}RESUME
AKANE KINOSHITA

154
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,087
{\an8}Akane Kinoshita, eh?

155
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,883
Do you have a preferred shift time?

156
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:38,967
If I'm not in class,

157
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,595
I'm happy to come anytime you need.

158
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,388
That's what I like to hear.

159
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:44,556
Your campus is nearby,

160
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,266
so it should be an easy commute.

161
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:47,601
Yes!

162
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,603
Our store is pretty busy,

163
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,981
so I'd love it if you could come often.
Is that okay?

164
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,816
Yes! I'll do my best!

165
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,443
NEEDS THE MONEY

166
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,069
<i>You got a convenience store job?</i>

167
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,571
<i>I had no idea you were looking.</i>

168
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,947
It's only short-term.

169
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,325
The store is near campus.

170
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:06,328
The one on the main street
with the long-haired manager.

171
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,497
<i>Oh, that one.</i>

172
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,249
<i>Tell me when your shift is finalized.</i>
<i>I'll come by.</i>

173
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,626
Please do!

174
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:14,878
But why a part-time job?

175
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,255
They fixed your computer, right?

176
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,798
<i>Yeah, but…</i>

177
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,133
<i>Eita--</i>

178
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:23,220
<i>One of the other guild members</i>
<i>gave me parts for free.</i>

179
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,639
<i>I'm sure they're worth a lot.</i>

180
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,893
<i>I can't just not pay.</i>

181
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,228
I plan on asking him the cost

182
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,146
when I log in today.

183
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,065
<i>You're gonna wait to ask him in game, huh?</i>

184
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,274
Yeah!

185
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,277
Well, they did help you out.

186
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:40,570
I guess you owe them thanks.

187
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,155
Momo!

188
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,657
Oh, I've been called.

189
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,283
<i>I've got a blind date to get to.</i>

190
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,868
<i>Let's talk more later.</i>

191
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:47,911
Right!

192
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,747
Momo, you take too long in the restroom.

193
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,666
The men are waiting.

194
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,168
Sorry! A friend of mine called.

195
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,128
-A friend?
-Akane.

196
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,381
She got a part-time job.

197
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,882
Oh, Kinoshita!

198
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,885
I haven't seen her
at any blind dates recently.

199
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:06,304
She's busy playing online video games.

200
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,973
Just let her be.

201
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,434
Okay! Today's the day I find my prince!

202
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,145
THE BLIND DATE'S OVER.
NO PRINCE TODAY EITHER.

203
00:14:14,229 --> 00:14:15,105
{\an8}TEARS

204
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,231
Too bad.

205
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:20,360
{\an8}<i>Momo can't find a man</i>
<i>who meets her standards.</i>

206
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,028
{\an8}JUST TOOK A BATH.
DOING FACIAL CLEANSING.

207
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:25,240
{\an8}<i>"If you give up, it's game over."</i>

208
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,202
{\an8}<i>Still…</i>

209
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,122
{\an8}<i>Is it even possible to meet someone</i>

210
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,040
{\an8}<i>who immediately seems perfect?</i>

211
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:36,751
SYSTEM: AKANE HAS LOGGED IN

212
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,423
Princess Ruri!

213
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,508
Akane!

214
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,677
Long time no see!

215
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,012
Hello!

216
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,514
{\an8}I can't believe that's Eita.

217
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,016
{\an8}NO INHIBITIONS
TYPE WHO KEEPS HER SENSES

218
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,309
What's going on?

219
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:56,271
I was having a guild meeting
with the <i>Submas.</i>

220
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,355
The <i>Submas?</i>

221
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,149
{\an8}SUBMAS MEANS "SUB-MASTER"

222
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,901
Where are they?

223
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,402
Over there! Just look!

224
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,070
Right there!

225
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,545
Whoa! They're tiny!

226
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,631
The <i>submas</i> is tiny!

227
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,091
It's a race called a "micronest."

228
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:27,594
They're very small outside of battle.

229
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,639
Most consider them a gimmick race,

230
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,224
but if you raise them right,
they can become very strong!

231
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,268
Right, Takezo?

232
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:37,479
Hello, Akane!

233
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,023
I'm Takeza Kamota.

234
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:43,735
My character is named Takezo.

235
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,487
Mr. Kamota?!

236
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,863
Tsk, tsk.

237
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,823
Here, he's Takezo.

238
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,241
Oh, right. Sorry.

239
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,662
Takezo doesn't exit the dungeon often,

240
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,248
so it's rare to see him in the guild!

241
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:58,541
He's quite cute,

242
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,126
but if the camera pulls back,

243
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,836
I can't see him at all.

244
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,755
I know, right?

245
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:07,926
Oh, that's right. I wanted to ask
you something, Princess Ruri.

246
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,386
Oh yeah? What?

247
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:13,515
<i>"I was wondering how much I owe"</i>

248
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,600
<i>"for repairing my computer."</i>

249
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,354
I'M NOT TELLING YOU!

250
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,605
<i>Huh? But why?</i>

251
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:25,652
NO WORRIES. THEY WERE ALL SPARE PARTS.

252
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,279
I can't just accept that.

253
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:33,159
What do I do, Takezo?

254
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:35,912
I understand how both of you feel.

255
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:38,164
It's a tough one.

256
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,375
As a compromise,

257
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:45,422
why not ask Akane
to take part in our plan?

258
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:47,966
That's a great idea!

259
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:50,927
<i>Plan?</i>

260
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,807
HAUNTED MAID CAFE

261
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,937
HOT DOGS

262
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,984
Oh, wow! It's Yamada!

263
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:06,943
Huh? Where?

264
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:08,778
Should we try talking to him?

265
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:09,821
What about?

266
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:10,947
Um…

267
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,199
About video games or something?

268
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,659
What's that thing he does?

269
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:16,411
F-P…

270
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:17,954
Oh, someone else is coming.

271
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,498
Hey.

272
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:21,458
Hi.

273
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,584
Taking out the trash?

274
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,960
Looks heavy.

275
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,256
As always, the girls
have their eyes glued on you.

276
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:31,551
If you entered the Mr. Academy contest,
you'd be sure to win.

277
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,137
It's such a waste that you keep saying no.

278
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,639
Even so, the organizers

279
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:39,184
still haven't given up.

280
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,562
They asked me to convince you.

281
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,232
<i>If Yamada ever gets a girlfriend,</i>

282
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,610
<i>I bet some girls will be in tears.</i>

283
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,863
<i>-There'll be a riot at school.</i>
-Your point…?

284
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,782
Oh, well.

285
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:54,783
Are you free today?

286
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,284
Wanna game when we get home?

287
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:57,243
SURE

288
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,244
Yamada-kun!

289
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:02,874
Your phone's been ringing non-stop!

290
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,292
Thanks.

291
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,670
Huh? What was that reaction?

292
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,298
You can do better than that.

293
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,382
How about…

294
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,886
-Something like that.
<i>-Non-stop?</i>

295
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:15,970
-Or…
<i>-It must be Eita.</i>

296
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,848
"Thanks, kittens."

297
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:19,891
Or…

298
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:31,111
The vibrations made your desk rattle.

299
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,489
{\an8}I put a towel under it.

00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,615

301
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,201

00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,746
Thank you very much,

303
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,789
Tsubaki.

304
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,340
I watched your match yesterday.

305
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,092
Your aim was off.

306
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:55,385
Reactions were dull.

307
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,095
Losing your touch?

308
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,514
You spend too much time on that MMO.

309
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,975
Maybe you stink at FPS now?

310
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,229
Yesterday's server was overseas.

311
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,230
The lag was--

312
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,857
Don't blame the network.

313
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,276
Right.

319
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,505
<i>Sponsor?</i>

320
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,176
FOS is the game you play, right?

321
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:37,677
Yeah.

322
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,512
Is it fun?

323
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:41,431
Yeah.

324
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,114
So, uh… what's this thing?

325
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,824
An external graphics card.

326
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,326
Keep it plugged in when you're gaming.

327
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,161
The whole time?

328
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,246
Yes.

329
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:29,539
THE WHOLE TIME…

330
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,707
Oh, but…

331
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,875
It does seem faster than before.

332
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,836
The movements are all smooth.

333
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:35,795
Why's that?

334
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,839
Did you fix that too?

335
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,340
You're amazing, Yamada!

336
00:21:39,424 --> 00:21:42,593
I just replaced the parts.

337
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:43,720
Most of them

338
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,514
were spare parts that Eita had.

339
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,725
In addition to the graphics card,

340
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,810
I replaced the old model CPU,

341
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,603
doubled your memory,

342
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,815
and changed your hard drive to an SSD,
which is probably why it's faster.

343
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,902
I don't know what that means, but…

344
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,281
Is it basically an all-new computer?

345
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,116
You could say that.

346
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,287
Thanks again, Yamada.

347
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,039
You really helped me out.

348
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,040
Not at all.

349
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,377
HE REALLY IS GOD-LIKE…

350
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,378
{\an8}DAYS LATER

351
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:22,967
Today is a private event
to welcome Akane back to the game.

352
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:27,346
To celebrate, the three of us
will do a dungeon conquest tour!

353
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,389
Let's do it!

00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:29,891
THIRD MEMBER

355
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,894
Th… Thank you very much!

356
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:36,272
There's no need to be nervous.

357
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,066
At your level,

358
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:40,568
you should have no problem

359
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:41,986
with today's course, Akane.

360
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,990
We'll do our best to support you too.

361
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,700
<i>Oh, Mr. Kamota…</i>

362
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:50,745
<i>He's so kind in the game and in real life!</i>

363
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:54,499
<i>His avatar sort of suits him too.</i>

364
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:55,666
<i>I like it!</i>

365
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:00,588
Okay everyone, let's go!

366
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,548
Off to the dungeon!

367
00:23:02,632 --> 00:23:03,758
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

368
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,218
<i>Okay…</i>

369
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:08,179
