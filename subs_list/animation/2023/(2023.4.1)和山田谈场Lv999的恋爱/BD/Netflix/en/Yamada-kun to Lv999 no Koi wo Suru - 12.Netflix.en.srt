1
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,385
Hey!

2
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:12,638
You there! The Paladin
with the roughed-up equipment!

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,226
{\an8}Would you like me to fix your things?

4
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,895
{\an8}If you're a newbie, I'll give you a deal.

5
00:00:21,272 --> 00:00:23,607
{\an8}I'm Princess Ruri!

6
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:26,193
{\an8}Nice to meet you, Ms. Paladin!

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,822
<i>There's something I want to tell you.</i>

8
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,240
Do you have time?

9
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:47,047
ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

10
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:04,291
Where are we?!

11
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:05,668
Don't spook me like that!

12
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,130
I thought you were about to ask me out.

13
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,632
Oh, sorry! Did I give off that vibe?

14
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,717
That's the only vibe you gave off.

15
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,136
I said I'm sorry…

16
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,387
And…?

17
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,264
What did you want to tell me?

18
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:21,142
Well, you see…

19
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,144
TEN MINUTES LATER

20
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:26,272
Akane means to say she's in love!

21
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,898
{\an8}Oh, that's a surprise!

22
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:29,066
{\an8}Congratulations!

23
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,652
Shall I guess who it is?

24
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,655
Don't say it.

25
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,575
I'm quite moved, you know.

26
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:40,661
{\an8}<i>When I first met you,</i>

27
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:44,415
{\an8}<i>you were wandering around</i>
<i>the game world looking jaded.</i>

28
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,916
{\an8}Thinking back,

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,836
you were probably still in turmoil
from your breakup.

30
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,797
But you've recovered, huh?

31
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:52,715
Well done.

32
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,050
Even so, she's still fretting over

33
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,719
the reason her boyfriend dumped her!

34
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:57,845
Huh? What's that about?

35
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,221
That's looking backwards!

36
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,640
Um…

37
00:03:01,724 --> 00:03:04,101
It might sound that way,

38
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:07,688
but I just want to know
if I have any bad qualities to fix.

39
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,857
From my perspective,

40
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,484
I'm looking to the future.

41
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,487
That's why I…

42
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,865
It's just…

43
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,743
When I saw your face, Eita…

44
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,829
I wanted to talk to Princess Ruri!

45
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,333
The ones who picked me up when I was down

46
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,710
were Momo and Princess Ruri.

47
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,963
When I realized I was in love,

48
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,798
I wanted to tell you both.

49
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:38,552
Sure.

50
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,430
The one you like

51
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,599
is someone I've known for a long time.

52
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:44,725
He's a good guy.

53
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:47,603
Everyone concentrates on his looks,

54
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,855
but his kindness is pretty rare too.

55
00:03:50,481 --> 00:03:52,608
I guess you know that.

56
00:03:53,943 --> 00:03:55,527
But it's true.

57
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,614
He's a block head,
but he's got a big heart.

58
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,158
Just be your true self.

59
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,327
In fact, too direct
is probably just right.

60
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:05,496
Give it your best shot!

61
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,581
If he rejects you, Momo and I are here.

62
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:08,749
He's right, Akane!

63
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,792
A woman must be bold!

64
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,335
Act first, ask questions later!

65
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,671
In fact, you should go
and tell him right now!

66
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,964
Yeah! She's right!

67
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,675
I… understand.

68
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,219
I'll go all or nothing!

69
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,804
Hope it's all and not nothing.

70
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,931
I'll do my best to make it all!

71
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:38,279
Thanks! I adore you both!

72
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,703
{\an8}I hope it's all, not nothing.

73
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,080
{\an8}Well, who can really say.

74
00:04:48,747 --> 00:04:51,709
Let me reintroduce myself.
I'm Momoko Maeda.

75
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,043
And I'm Eita Sasaki.

76
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,628
I'm a 20-year old college student

77
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,130
and I want to get married.

78
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,464
OH YEAH?

79
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,091
Do you have a girlfriend?

80
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,847
<i>When did I… start falling for him?</i>

81
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,893
<i>Even looking back, I can't remember.</i>

82
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,020
MOVE FORWARD
TOKYO WALK

83
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,438
<i>It's just that…</i>

84
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:14,481
<i>seeing him finally smile</i>

85
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,775
<i>makes me happy.</i>

86
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:17,776
IT'S CROWDED…

87
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,987
<i>Pretending not to notice,</i>

88
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,489
<i>or telling myself he's just a friend…</i>

89
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,868
<i>Hiding my feelings like that</i>

90
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,745
<i>was probably pointless.</i>

91
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,997
Oh, I'm sorry!

92
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,045
<i>Calm down!</i>

93
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,464
Are you okay?

94
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,308
<i>I'm fine now.</i>

95
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:05,574
Yeah?

96
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,412
Huh?

97
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,002
Y-Yo!

98
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:19,797
Hi.

99
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,716
Um…

100
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,384
Do you need something?

101
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,893
-Actually, there's something…
-Oh, hello there!

102
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,604
-That I really want to tell you.
-Time for your walk, already?

103
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:36,897
-Um…
-What'd you say?

104
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,942
Is it time for your walk, already?

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,528
-Um…
-Oh, hello!

106
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,446
-Say, today--
-Today?

107
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,781
Today, I wanted to…

108
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,367
-It's a warm day, isn't it?
-Indeed!

109
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,246
-I wish every day could be this warm!
-Um…

110
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:57,000
It really is warm…

111
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,419
-Akane…
-Yes?!

112
00:06:59,503 --> 00:07:03,132
-Forgive me, I have to go to cram school.
-At the station.

113
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,299
-You do?
-I saw your granddaughter, Emi!

114
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:07,094
Since it's a Saturday,
I thought you would be free.

115
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:09,555
-I'm happy to listen though.
-Did you hear me? Emi!

116
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:11,640
Can we talk on the way to the station?

117
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,600
-She's your granddaughter, right?
-Oh, yes!

118
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,937
Actually, couldn't we have
talked over the phone?

119
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,356
<i>You fool.</i>

120
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,859
<i>He has his own routine.</i>

121
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:23,861
<i>What was I thinking?</i>

122
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,947
Sorry, I'll come back another--

123
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,205
I hear Emi is in the band now!

124
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,499
Yes, but it will rain later.

125
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,964
I just need to change.

126
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,133
Please wait here.

127
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,095
R-Right…

128
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,431
Sorry to bother you when you're busy!

129
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:55,350
<i>He startled me…</i>

130
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,061
It seems like your cold is better.

131
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,439
Yeah! Thanks to you.

132
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,065
Oh yeah. I wanted to make it up--

133
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,820
<i>Turn the other way!</i>

134
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,363
-Sorry, I'm ready.
-Right!

135
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:10,866
So, what's up?

136
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,953
Oh, sorry. I've been thinking
of where to start.

137
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,914
I DIDN'T PLAN TO DO THIS OUT HERE

138
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:17,873
<i>No time to spare.</i>

139
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,334
<i>I have to tell him now.</i>

140
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,461
<i>It's what I came here to do.</i>

141
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:24,213
<i>But then…</i>

142
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:28,008
<i>There's no need to force it out</i>
<i>in the middle of town</i>

143
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:31,303
<i>when we're short on time.</i>

144
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,639
<i>Do it another day…</i>

145
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:35,891
<i>When we have more time…</i>

146
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,643
Akane!

147
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,855
The light… is red.

148
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,816
S-Sorry…

149
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,276
Are you okay?

150
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,237
You seem really spaced out.

151
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,865
<i>It's no good. My attention span…</i>

152
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:53,575
Sorry.

153
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:57,037
<i>Being together</i>
<i>is only going to cause him trouble</i>

154
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,456
<i>if all I can do is buy time.</i>

155
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:00,874
<i>Do it another day.</i>

156
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,627
Um… maybe today isn't the best…

157
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,296
Green light.

158
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,684
<i>Just like this…</i>

159
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,019
<i>Without saying a thing…</i>

160
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,106
<i>I could let him spoil me</i>
<i>with his kindness.</i>

161
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:26,942
<i>But hiding my feelings</i>

162
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:30,445
<i>just doesn't seem fair.</i>

163
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:34,491
Well, this is the station.

164
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,536
You didn't get a chance to talk.

165
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:38,870
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,290
I was too worried about being late.

167
00:09:41,373 --> 00:09:44,334
No, I was acting weird.

168
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,335
You really were.

169
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,295
IGNORING THE TRAFFIC LIGHT WAS CRAZY

170
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,047
Well then, next time…

171
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:53,802
Is it important?

172
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:58,390
Maybe, after class…

173
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,058
Though it will be late…

174
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,185
If you don't mind, I'll call you.

175
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,606
If you really want to talk today…

176
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,692
Are you sure? Won't you be tired?

177
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,652
Not too tired to listen.

178
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,989
Though I'm not
the best conversation partner.

179
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:14,906
SHORT RESPONSE MACHINE

180
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,243
That'd be great!

181
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll be going, then.

182
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,543
Have a good day!

183
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,003
Study hard!

184
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,005
BYE-BYE!

185
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,728
Bad weather, suddenly…

186
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,396
It was sunny just a moment ago.

187
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,280
That'll be all for today.

188
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,784
Please do the follow-up exercises
in your textbooks.

189
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:02,287
Rain, huh?

190
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,332
What are we going to do, Yamada?
It's pouring.

191
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,501
I have a folding umbrella.

192
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,418
My hero!

193
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,504
Walk with me, will you?

194
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,797
Fine.

195
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,673
You okay, Ms. President?

196
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,634
I don't have an umbrella.

197
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,260
I'm planning to run home.

198
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,929
Isn't that a little extreme?

199
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,306
I have no choice.

200
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,100
The rights to Yamada's umbrella…

201
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,935
go to you.

202
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:25,936
Fine, right Yamada?

203
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,188
Either one of you is okay with me.

204
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,399
That wouldn't be fair.
The two of you should go.

205
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,568
I can't leave a lady in distress.

206
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,946
Plus, it's a chance to go home with him.

207
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,489
Don't let it slip away!

208
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,910
Thanks but no thanks.

209
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,578
You'll only make him suspicious.

210
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,331
If you don't make him a little suspicious,

211
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,833
things will go nowhere.

212
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,418
Especially in your case.

213
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:52,421
CRAM SCHOOL

214
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,883
<i>I guess they can't reach a decision.</i>

215
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,178
<i>Maybe I'll give them the umbrella</i>

216
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,346
<i>and run home myself.</i>

217
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,640
I WANNA GO HOME…

218
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,850
Yamada-kun!

219
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,269
Um…

220
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,147
On second thought,

221
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,275
can I walk with you to the station?

222
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,487
So anyway, I tried that new game.

223
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:20,365
It was a beta, so there were
still a lot of bugs,

224
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,534
but it seems pretty fun.

225
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:29,833
Hurry up!

226
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,418
Give me a second!

227
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,003
You're too slow, Saki!

228
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,172
I can't run in these shoes!

229
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,257
Seriously?

230
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,925
Is she someone you know?

231
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:39,885
Huh?

232
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:44,431
You were staring at that girl
who was running.

233
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:47,267
I wasn't.

234
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,077
Tsubaki,

235
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,289
please use the umbrella on your own.

236
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,212
Huh, why?

237
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,923
There's no sense
in you getting wet. Go ahead.

238
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,633
But what about you?

239
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,675
I'm going to run.

240
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,552
-But--
-I'm almost at my station.

241
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,554
Wait!

242
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:46,993
Wait!

243
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:48,828
Wait!

244
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,914
Yamada-kun, wait!

245
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,667
Wait!

246
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,128
Excuse me…

247
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,550
<i>My glasses…</i>

248
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:05,554
<i>I can't see.</i>

249
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,903
There's a crack.

250
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,657
Are you okay?

251
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:32,831
I like you.

252
00:14:32,914 --> 00:14:34,165
Huh?

253
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,507
I like you.

254
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,333
I'm sorry for being a bother.

255
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,378
But… please…

256
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:21,755
Just for today…

257
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,968
Let me be in your thoughts.

258
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,308
<i>Just for today…</i>

259
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,489
I WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK TODAY.

260
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,741
{\an8}LET'S DO IT WHEN WE HAVE TIME. SORRY.

261
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,923
That was some rain yesterday.

262
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:08,218
I was asleep, but the noise woke me up.

263
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,637
And then I couldn't get back to sleep--

264
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,931
Runa, you've lost focus, haven't you?

265
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,557
Yup! I sure have!

266
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,647
I'm sure you're tired,

267
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,315
so I bought some donuts.

268
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,817
-Both of you, help yourselves!
-Yay!

269
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,737
Yamada, I know you have your own exams.
Thanks for this.

270
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:32,075
Runa won't accept
any teacher other than you.

271
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,202
She must really like you!

272
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,204
Seeing you two like this,

273
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,623
I can't help but think
you look good together.

274
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:39,958
Right, big brother?

275
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,292
Now now, Mom.

276
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,836
Your ambitions are naked!

277
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:45,088
-What do you mean?
-Beats me.

278
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:48,591
All I said was that
they look good together.

279
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:51,344
-Right. That's all.
-Any idea what they're talking about?

280
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:52,595
{\an8}Who knows…?

281
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:53,972
{\an8}It must be some sort of joke.

282
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,226
By the way, Akito… yesterday…

283
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,603
A girl confessed to you, didn't they?

284
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:01,980
HUH?
I CAN'T SOLVE THIS ONE.

285
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,982
How did you know?

286
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,276
I know everything.

287
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,778
<i>So Akane really told him.</i>

288
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,363
<i>She sure is something.</i>

289
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:13,158
And…? What was your answer?

290
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,660
-It's none of your business.
-Of course it is.

291
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:17,078
<i>Wait, is it?</i>

292
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,497
I'm thinking about it.

293
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,959
Oh, is it like that?

294
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,171
I thought you might be interested.

295
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,257
-You get along well.
-I guess…

296
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,259
You're always so indecisive.

297
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:32,302
THINKING TOO LONG WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD

298
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:35,346
You better give her
a straight answer soon.

299
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,767
The worst thing you can do
is play with another person's feelings.

300
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,562
I'm not playing!

301
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,317
-Uh oh, Eita. You've made him mad again.
-What?!

302
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,152
I'm sorry, Akito! Don't be angry!

303
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,072
-Here, have these donuts!
-Those are mine!

304
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,282
<i>The number you are calling</i>

305
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:58,078
<i>is unavailable…</i>

306
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:00,288
FRIED CHICKEN FESTIVAL

307
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,539
Huh?

308
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,583
Akane! Akane!

309
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,335
Look… outside!

310
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,755
Hey, Yamada!

311
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,841
What brings you here?

312
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:12,926
It's not so often

313
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,552
that you come to our store.

314
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,387
Shouldn't you be working?

315
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,389
I switched to outside duty.

316
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,558
Were you perhaps looking for me?

317
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:21,810
Just kidding!

318
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:22,977
Yeah.

319
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,105
I called you just now,

320
00:18:25,188 --> 00:18:26,356
but it didn't connect.

321
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,650
Oh… sorry about that.

322
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,362
My phone was at 3% when I left home.

323
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,738
That's fine.

324
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:35,615
If I happened to see you,

325
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,118
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

326
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,577
That's…

327
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,623
I'm not upset.

328
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,875
It wasn't that important.

329
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:49,796
Actually, I talked to Momo
about it yesterday.

330
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,382
I feel much better now.

331
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,384
But more important than that…

332
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,261
You seem kind of down today.

333
00:18:56,344 --> 00:18:57,470
What's the matter?

334
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,223
Do I?

335
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,183
I feel perfectly normal.

336
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,476
You're completely different!

337
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,978
Your voice is a monotone…

338
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,312
Well, it always is...

339
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:07,856
But you're not saying much…

340
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,774
Well, you never do, but…

341
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,484
The usual Yamada is like this.

342
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,777
But today, you're like this.

343
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:14,279
I DON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE

344
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,363
EVEN SO, SHE'S SHARP

345
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:19,909
These days…

346
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,620
I've been busy. Maybe I'm tired.

347
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,497
Or something like that.

348
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,791
<i>Tired from exam studying?</i>

349
00:19:27,709 --> 00:19:29,169
<i>It must be tough.</i>

350
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,629
<i>He's in a different league from me.</i>

351
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:33,256
I see…

352
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:38,261
That reminds me! The other day,

353
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:40,722
I upgraded my equipment in FOS.

354
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:43,183
I wanted to show off to you,

355
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,685
but you never log in these days.

356
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,062
I got myself a good sword.

357
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,564
What kind is it?

358
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,608
What kind…

359
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,483
you ask?

360
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,195
{\an8}Like the weapon's rank or type.

361
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:56,779
{\an8}OR WHETHER IT'S EVEN REAL…

362
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,239
{\an8}Well…

363
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,325
Give me your hand.

364
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:03,161
-Is that a permanent marker?
-Give me your hand.

365
00:20:04,204 --> 00:20:07,123
Bosses leave behind
good plunder, don't they?

366
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,667
I finally understand now

367
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,628
why you always hunt them.

368
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,755
Well, the chances are still pretty low.

369
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,466
Right, and that's why,
when they drop something nice,

370
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,135
it makes you jump for joy.

371
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:22,764
I don't know what's wrong,

372
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:24,140
but cheer up!

373
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:27,602
Return to your usual unflappable self.

374
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,979
I'LL DRAW MY CHARACTER TOO

375
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:31,356
WHAT DO MY CLOTHES LOOK LIKE AGAIN?

376
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,109
That's how I seem to you?

377
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,697
I only keep quiet,

378
00:20:40,198 --> 00:20:43,117
because I'm scared
of saying the wrong thing.

379
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,664
I can't read people's feelings deeply,

380
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:51,501
and I don't understand jokes
a lot of the time.

381
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,379
I think that

382
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,589
just makes me dull.

383
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,638
Well, in my case…

384
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,433
The way you sometimes make shrewd comments

385
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,185
is uh…

386
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:10,937
something I like.

387
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,231
Or when we're all together,
even if you're quiet,

388
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:15,858
you watch out for everyone.

389
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:19,737
I know you try to help
when people are in need.

390
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,824
Because you helped me a lot.

391
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:25,827
There's nothing dull about that.

392
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,161
I told you before, didn't I?

393
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,163
You can believe me.

394
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,540
I mean it!

395
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:32,917
Okay?

396
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,802
<i>I sigh</i>

397
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,470
<i>when I wake up in the morning.</i>

398
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:11,891
<i>At some point, it became a habit.</i>

399
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,021
<i>Isn't love…</i>

400
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:18,731
Yukari,

401
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,817
are you going out at this time of night?

402
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,776
Just for a bit.

403
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,861
I made a promise to a friend.

404
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:26,405
Come home right away, okay?

405
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:32,203
<i>Isn't it supposed to be</i>
<i>more fun than this?</i>

406
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,919
