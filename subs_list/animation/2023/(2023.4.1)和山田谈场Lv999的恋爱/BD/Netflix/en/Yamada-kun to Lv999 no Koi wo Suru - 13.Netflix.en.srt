00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,587
<i>I sigh</i>

2
00:00:04,088 --> 00:00:05,756
<i>when I wake up in the morning.</i>

3
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:10,010
<i>At some point, it became a habit.</i>

4
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:15,307
<i>Isn't love…</i>

5
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:22,940
<i>…supposed to be more fun than this?</i>

00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:39,040
ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

7
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:00,746
Wow…

8
00:02:01,497 --> 00:02:02,873
You're right on time.

9
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:05,751
I didn't think you'd be here early.

10
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,129
-Sorry.
-It's fine.

11
00:02:12,842 --> 00:02:14,093
<i>Surely…</i>

12
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,345
<i>I'm about to be…</i>

13
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,556
<i>rejected.</i>

14
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,102
You know,

15
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:26,313
I've liked you since our freshman year.

16
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:27,231
Did you notice?

17
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,484
-No.
-That figures…

18
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,279
I've tried hard to keep you from noticing.

19
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,990
"Please don't let him find out."

20
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,325
It's all I ever thought about.

21
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,619
I guess all that…

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,746
ends today.

23
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,624
But when I woke up, I realized

24
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:50,713
that I don't have to pretend anymore.

25
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,257
Then I felt a little relieved.

26
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:56,844
And that's why…

27
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:59,138
I don't regret it.

28
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,896
-There are some things I'd like to say.
-Sure.

29
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:11,150
I like the way you play.

30
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,360
As a gamer, I mean.

31
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:16,739
You always keep your cool
and you never lash out.

32
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,658
When it comes to player vs. player,

33
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,619
a lot of people lose their temper.

34
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,163
-But you never act that way.
-Right…

35
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:27,583
I admire that maturity.

36
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,293
Thanks.

37
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,295
Also, when you drift off in class,

38
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,172
I like how you always look out the window.

39
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:37,468
Oh, and I didn't want to seem like
everyone else, so I never told you…

40
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:40,387
But I've always thought
you have a handsome face

41
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,765
and I like the way you don't show it off.

42
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,266
Oh, and your voice too.

43
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,476
It's really soothing.

44
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,810
And your quiet nature.

45
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,188
The way you walk, the way you run…

46
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,065
and your slow speaking pace too.

47
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:54,068
When you're at a loss,
you have a habit of blinking, right?

48
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,362
There! I like that a lot too.

49
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,114
And I really like how
you're equally kind to everyone.

50
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,617
Over the last three years,

51
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,995
I'm sure a lot of girls have liked you,

52
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,999
but I have no doubt that none
of them liked you as much as me.

53
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:12,044
I swear it.

54
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,257
In all the world,

55
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,926
I liked you the most!

56
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,811
<i>I can't… see him clearly.</i>

57
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,147
<i>But…</i>

58
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,650
<i>I said it all.</i>

59
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,945
<i>It was weighing me down like lead.</i>

60
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,240
<i>It hurt for so long.</i>

61
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,034
<i>That's why…</i>

62
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,954
<i>I know I won't regret this.</i>

63
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,666
What a relief.

64
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,468
Tsubaki,

65
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,220
I…

66
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,683
I'm afraid…

67
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:10,102
I can't return your feelings.

68
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,234
Right…

69
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,365
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,200
I…

71
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,954
There's something

72
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:29,913
on your hand.

73
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,168
This is…

74
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,214
An acquaintance was playing around…

75
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:41,216
I know…

76
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,302
who it was.

77
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,599
It's the girl…

78
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,643
you like,

79
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,854
isn't it?

80
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:05,407
Yes.

81
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,332
Thank you for feeling that way about me.

82
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,460
I'm sorry

83
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,420
I can't do the same.

84
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,674
It's fine.

85
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:25,344
I'm happy that you listened to me.

86
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:28,931
I'm glad I told you.

87
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,185
<i>I knew, you know.</i>

88
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,147
<i>I've been watching all this time.</i>

89
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,025
<i>Even if it was tiny…</i>

90
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,653
<i>I saw a change in you.</i>

91
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,240
<i>Even if no one else noticed,</i>

92
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,871
<i>I knew it right away.</i>

93
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,670
I feel better having said everything.

94
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,339
Thank you for your time.

95
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,050
I'll head home now.

96
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:08,387
See you at school.

97
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,974
Uh… um…

98
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,434
should I walk with you?

99
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,644
Your glasses are broken and it's dark too.

100
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,730
-It's fine. I'll go alone.
-But…

101
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:20,816
I'll be fine.

102
00:07:21,316 --> 00:07:22,985
I'm stronger than you think!

103
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,575
Right.

104
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,078
Thanks.

105
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,710
<i>You were kind to the very end.</i>

106
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:40,794
<i>I'm glad.</i>

107
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,798
<i>I really liked that about you.</i>

108
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,638
<i>I really liked you.</i>

109
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,979
I do have a break from school,

110
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,273
but my part-time job schedule
is up in the air.

111
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,484
Oh, is it loud?

112
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:05,652
Sorry, I'm getting ready to go out.

113
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,071
We're having a guild meeting.

114
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:10,157
No, not a school club.

115
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,451
I told you before, didn't I?

116
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,203
My online gaming friends…

117
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,496
Yeah, them.

118
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,165
We're going out for dinner together.

119
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,670
YAKINIKU BARBECUE RESTAURANT

120
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,006
I think I see her.

121
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,799
-Look!
-Oh, you're right!

122
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,384
Akane!

123
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:30,302
RUNA!

124
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:33,347
-Long time no see, Mr. Kamota.
-What will we have?

125
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,098
Thank you so much for coming!

126
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:38,185
-No, thank you for inviting me.
-Can we order spare ribs?

127
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,479
-Spare ribs?
-Spare ribs sound good.

128
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:41,438
Spare ribs for me!

129
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,899
-Spare-ribs! Spare-ribs!
<i>-Huh? Where's Yamada?</i>

130
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:45,817
The one you're looking for will be late.

131
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:47,236
Hi there!

132
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,988
You startled me! Hi!

133
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:52,199
Shall I set up some
time alone for you two?

134
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,159
He's been busy lately,

135
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:56,411
and there's little time to meet, right?

136
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:59,831
In the end, I didn't get the chance
to ask him out!

137
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,500
Don't worry about it.

138
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,335
Tonight I came for the barbecue.

139
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,337
-Welcome!
-Are you sure?

140
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,464
We have a reservation under Kamota.

141
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,841
We've been awaiting
your arrival, Mr. Kamota!

142
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:11,927
Plus…

143
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,472
Yamada seems pretty tired lately.

144
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,392
It must be stress from studying for exams.

145
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,977
I doubt that.

146
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:23,522
He barely has to study for a good score.

147
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,731
Is that true?!

148
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:28,819
<i>Then was it just</i>
<i>my imagination the other day?</i>

149
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,612
This place looks expensive!

150
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,197
Will it be expensive meat too?

151
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,992
-Runa, please keep your voice down.
-Why?

152
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:35,951
LOVES BARBECUE

153
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:39,371
{\an8}My friend owns this place.

154
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,707
{\an8}It just opened last month.

155
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,210
They've been asking me to come,
but I thought it would be more fun

156
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:47,129
if we all came together!

157
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,338
Really?

158
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,966
I guess you have lots
of connections, Mr. Kamota.

159
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,343
President Kamota!

160
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:54,845
It has been too long.

161
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,847
Oh, Inoue!

162
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,140
You look well.

163
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,225
Yes, and you look the same, sir.

164
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,769
Is business going well?

165
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,521
Thanks for your support.

166
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,106
Oh, President Kamota!

167
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,441
You're here too?

168
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:10,485
Oh, Mr. Obayashi! Hello!

169
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,738
President Kamota! Fancy seeing you here!

170
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,990
Chairman Nagaoka! How nice to see you.

171
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,075
Oh, if it isn't Mr. Kamota!

172
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,745
Ms. Sumiyoshi, nice to see you.

173
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,247
How amazing that you're all here!

174
00:10:22,331 --> 00:10:25,167
Um, that's a bit too many connections.

175
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,960
Just how important is he?

176
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,131
Wow! We got a private room!

177
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,098
Oh, that's so good!

178
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:43,393
It always tastes
better with a lot of people.

179
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,481
I was sorry to hear
the new member couldn't come.

180
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,442
I invited her, but it seems
she had other plans.

181
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,527
Who needs her?!

182
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:55,113
Excuse us.

183
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:01,286
This is on behalf of Mr. Inoue.

184
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,288
{\an8}This is from Mr. Obayashi.

185
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,290
This is from Mr. Nagaoka.

186
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,043
This is from Ms. Sumiyoshi.

187
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:11,463
I HOPE THEY DIDN'T SPEND TOO MUCH…

188
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,548
Oh no, I guess they felt obligated.

189
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,550
There's sake too! Wow!

190
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:18,887
<i>I've never seen this happen</i>
<i>in real life before.</i>

191
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,846
This is so cool!

192
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,308
I wanna become a big man
like you one day, Mr. Kamota!

193
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,561
What are you talking about?

194
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,688
You're already a fine young man.

195
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,692
I'm only able to hunt
in the dungeon without worry

196
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:37,948
because you take care
of all the guild work.

197
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:41,284
That's only because you
support me behind the scenes.

198
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:43,703
That's not true!

199
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:47,541
You always set the stage
for me to have fun

200
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,419
and introduce me to so many good friends.

201
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,713
Every day is truly fun.

202
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:59,010
I hope we can continue to have fun
together for a long time.

203
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,138
I agree!

204
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,015
I want the guild to stay
as it is now, forever!

205
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,267
As it is now!

206
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,396
<i>As it is now… forever…</i>

207
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,566
Then again, change is necessary too.

208
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:15,193
I'll keep letting fresh air in
once in a while.

209
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,820
Huh? I'm absolutely against it!

210
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,613
Why can't things stay as they are?

211
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,615
Have no fear of change!

212
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,993
I was grilling that piece!

213
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,536
That may be,

214
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,663
but since I'm the one who raised you,

215
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,748
it's as if I grilled it myself.

216
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,125
You are so annoying, Eita!

217
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,128
HIGH-GRADE RICE WINE

218
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,883
Welcome!

219
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,844
You must be a part of Mr. Kamota's party.

220
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:42,387
I'll show you to your table.

221
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:45,640
The babysitter is here!

222
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,894
-Akito, you're late!
-Evening.

223
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,480
-We've been waiting for you!
-Yamada, get this!

224
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,107
Runa's really had her hands full!

225
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:56,943
-I thought you were coming earlier?
-I'm so worn out!

226
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,487
Um, hold on…

227
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,614
-Akito, here's the menu.
-It was hard work!

228
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,865
-There are lots of options.
-Are you listening?

229
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,367
-Don't all speak at once…
-I'm serious!

230
00:13:05,577 --> 00:13:07,704
Oh no, she's back!

231
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,378
Hey look, it's Yamada!

232
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,465
<i>What the…</i>

233
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,470
Why is she so drunk?

234
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:28,558
It's my fault for encouraging her
to try all the sake we were given.

235
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:29,976
You're not at fault here!

236
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,480
Akane never knows when to stop!

237
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:38,026
I've had to deal with her
the whole time. It was so annoying!

238
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,613
Akane gets fairly giddy
when she's drunk, it seems.

239
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:42,864
I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE!

240
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,991
She's all yours, Yamada.

241
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,494
If she gets on your nerves,
you can leave her

242
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,704
in the bathroom like I did.

243
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,498
Um, I'd rather not.

244
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:55,001
Akito! Sit and enjoy the meal.

245
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:57,879
I'll arrange a taxi for Akane, later.

246
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,422
There's no need for that.

247
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,384
Akito will walk Akane home.

248
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,635
Are you sure?

249
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:04,594
Yup!

250
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,847
-How ya doin'?!
-Well, they do get along well.

251
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:10,475
I guess we can leave it to him?

252
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:13,353
Hey…

253
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,690
Whart took you sho long, Yarmada?

254
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,068
Sorry.

255
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,988
{\an8}<i>Delicious!</i>

256
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,492
We're better off hitting on girls here.

257
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,787
-Definitely.
-There are some cuties walking around.

258
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,421
-It's water.
-Huh?

259
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,882
Oh no, was I asleep?!

260
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:42,966
Yes.

261
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,175
I can't believe it.

262
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,343
Neither can I.

263
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,972
Oh, wow! Water!

264
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,682
I was really thirsty!

265
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,851
How did you know I needed water?

266
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,477
You made that very clear.

267
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,979
In fact, you sang it.

268
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,732
Thirsty, thirsty, I'm so thirsty!

269
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,902
This must be the desert!

270
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,404
I'm sorry for the trouble!

271
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,740
I swear I won't forget
what you've done for me!

272
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,160
I just never seem to remember
what happened while I was drunk.

273
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,703
I know, I'll write it down!

274
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,580
If it's in my phone, I'll always know!

275
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,624
You can forget. Let's just go home.

276
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,666
It's already late.

277
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,711
It's true! Look at the time…

278
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,213
Say, Yamada… this far is fine.

279
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:24,382
You don't have to walk me
all the way home.

280
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:25,967
It's not safe. I'll go with you.

281
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,345
There are a lot of drunks around here.

282
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,473
Other than you, that is.

283
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,245
Sorry, my heel is stuck.

284
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,878
Oh man, it won't budge.

285
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,298
Um…

286
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,718
I'm really sorry for taking up your time.

287
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,553
It has penetrated the surface.

288
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,773
Got it--

289
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,920
Shall we go?

290
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,242
I'll be going then.

291
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,077
Sleep well.

292
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,829
Thanks!

293
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,330
Be safe getting home.

294
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,713
Hey!

295
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,883
Um…

296
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,092
Y…

297
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,762
Yamada, do you like me or something?

298
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,558
Huh?

299
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,977
Oh, I uh…

300
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,437
Huh?

301
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,439
Somehow, I just got that feeling.

302
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,733
<i>After all…</i>

303
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:48,777
<i>His hand…</i>

304
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:54,783
I guess I've been caught.

305
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,746
<i>His hand against mine…</i>

306
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,372
Uh, um…

307
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,376
<i>…seemed to be saying so.</i>

308
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,383
I'm… still drunk.

309
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,386
Am I making sense?

310
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,013
Do you understand what I--

311
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,431
I like you.

312
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,143
I like you, Akane.

313
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:25,522
I don't mind

314
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,232
if you forget when you wake up.

315
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,360
I'll come tell you again.

316
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,363
Until you remember.

317
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,534
Good night.

318
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,586
Tomorrow…

319
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:50,505
YAMADA WITH THE AFRO?

320
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,632
When I wake… in the morning…

321
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,550
WHO ARE YOU?

322
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,806
Can I call you?

323
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,600
WELL, ROMANCE ISN'T ALL WINE
AND ROSES, ANYWAY

324
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,394
I'm sure I'll worry

325
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,315
that this was all a dream. So…

326
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,317
SOUNDS MISERABLE

327
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,822
Can I…

328
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:17,991
do that?

329
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,250
I'll call you.

330
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:31,171
Tomorrow…

331
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:40,096
When I wake in the morning.

332
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,620
AKITO YAMADA CALLING

333
00:21:31,996 --> 00:21:33,081
Hello?

334
00:21:33,623 --> 00:21:34,749
<i>Good morning.</i>

335
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:36,334
{\an8}Good morning!

336
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:37,460
{\an8}HASN'T SLEPT A WINK

337
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:38,837
{\an8}So, what happened next?

338
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,130
{\an8}What did you talk about?

339
00:21:40,213 --> 00:21:42,215
{\an8}Tell me everything! Word for word!

340
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:43,967
{\an8}Some things are secret.

341
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,719
{\an8}You have a new boyfriend?

342
00:21:46,803 --> 00:21:48,555
{\an8}That's great!

343
00:21:48,638 --> 00:21:50,515
{\an8}-What's he like?
-Wait a minute…

344
00:21:50,598 --> 00:21:51,975
{\an8}-Am I the only single one, now?
-He's a senior in high school.

345
00:21:52,058 --> 00:21:53,017
DESPITE ALL THOSE BLIND DATES

346
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:54,310
Oh, a younger man.

347
00:21:54,394 --> 00:21:55,353
Yeah.

348
00:21:55,436 --> 00:21:59,023
{\an8}I have trouble with younger men though.

349
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:00,066
{\an8}Really?

350
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,944
{\an8}I can't help but feel
that they want a mature woman

351
00:22:03,027 --> 00:22:05,363
{\an8}and stop showing my lighter side…

352
00:22:05,446 --> 00:22:06,281
A MATURE WOMAN?

353
00:22:06,364 --> 00:22:08,992
I was told they couldn't figure me out

354
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:12,120
and since then, I've found
younger men difficult.

355
00:22:12,203 --> 00:22:15,290
But I'm sure you'll be all right, Akane!

356
00:22:15,373 --> 00:22:17,292
That's your only reassurance?

357
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,751
Better you than me.

358
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:20,503
Oh, no you don't, Akane!

359
00:22:20,587 --> 00:22:23,131
No stressing out when I'm the single one!

360
00:22:23,214 --> 00:22:24,132
-IT'S SO UNFAIR!!
-MATURE WOMAN

361
00:22:24,215 --> 00:22:25,508
Sorry.

362
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,677
Whatever.

363
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,139
For what it's worth, I knew you'd
end up together sooner or later.

364
00:22:31,222 --> 00:22:32,807
Really?

365
00:22:32,891 --> 00:22:36,019
Yeah. I could just tell.

366
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:39,564
Was it that obvious that I was after him?

367
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:40,648
I DON'T KNOW HOW I COME ACROSS

368
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:41,649
No…

369
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,528
It was the opposite.

370
00:22:47,864 --> 00:22:51,826
And so, what I'm trying to say is…

371
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,995
you have exams soon, right?

372
00:22:54,078 --> 00:22:56,039
I'm sure you'll be short on time,

373
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:59,042
so you don't have to worry about me.

374
00:23:00,084 --> 00:23:03,296
I'll do my best not to be a burden on you.

375
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:05,006
But every once in a while…

376
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,633
When you're tired, perhaps…

377
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:08,885
You can depend on me for support.

378
00:23:08,968 --> 00:23:10,303
At least pretend to listen!

379
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,639
No, I was listening.

380
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:15,975
Up to "the kanji for person is really
two people holding each other up."

381
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:17,894
That was pretty early on.

382
00:23:17,977 --> 00:23:21,564
After that, I wasn't sure
what you were trying to say

383
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:25,777
and when I watched your lips
moving up and down,

384
00:23:26,277 --> 00:23:29,197
I noticed your canine teeth
are pretty sharp.

385
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,865
Huh?!

386
00:23:30,949 --> 00:23:33,409
I thought it was cute, so I kept looking.

387
00:23:33,493 --> 00:23:34,744
Cute?!

388
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:39,123
You're teasing me!

389
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:40,166
No, not at all.

390
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,417
MATURE WOMAN

391
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:42,502
SO MUCH FOR THAT

392
00:23:42,585 --> 00:23:45,338
<i>I don't think "mature woman"</i>
<i>will work for me.</i>

393
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:47,674
{\an8}I'll walk you home.

394
00:23:48,174 --> 00:23:49,425
{\an8}Thanks.

395
00:23:55,306 --> 00:23:57,100
-In the end…
-Yes?!

396
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:59,769
What did you really want to tell me?

397
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:01,062
{\an8}HASN'T STOPPED THINKING

398
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:04,190
Well…

399
00:24:04,816 --> 00:24:06,067
In other words…

400
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,488
when we're walking together,

401
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:13,157
I'd like to hold hands.

402
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:17,787
Oh?

403
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:19,288
Sorry.

404
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,797
Isn't there an easier way to say it?

405
00:24:28,715 --> 00:24:30,341
I'll work on it.

406
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:32,135
Please do.

407
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,850
<i>Is that… a shoe?</i>

408
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:41,936
<i>I think it's a shoe.</i>

409
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:45,606
<i>Can something like this</i>
<i>function as a shoe?</i>

410
00:24:46,107 --> 00:24:48,901
<i>No, that's the reason why</i>

411
00:24:48,985 --> 00:24:50,445
<i>she ended up like that.</i>

412
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,531
<i>If it leaves them face down on the street,</i>

413
00:24:54,657 --> 00:24:57,535
<i>why not wear normal shoes?</i>

414
00:24:59,662 --> 00:25:02,498
<i>I don't get women.</i>

415
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,084
Are you okay?

416
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:09,922
