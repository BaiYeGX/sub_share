1
00:00:01,293 --> 00:00:02,920
Welcome!

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:06,048
{\an8}How about some hot fried chicken?

3
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,676
Please touch your phone there!

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,137
DRAW ONE COUPON
FOR EVERY PURCHASE OVER 700!!

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,471
{\an8}By the way, sir…

6
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:15,433
{\an8}We're having a special campaign!

7
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,101
Please draw a coupon.

8
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,438
Wait…

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:22,273
Will you go to
the convenience store tomorrow?

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,691
-You will right?
-Is this the reason…

11
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,526
Why you were so insistent last night?

12
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:26,444
Why not?

13
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,320
{\an8}It's on your way home from school

14
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:30,948
{\an8}and you buy dinner
at the convenience store, anyway.

15
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:32,575
{\an8}I guess.

16
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,785
I haven't seen you since the festival.

17
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,162
Is Runa doing well?

18
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,246
Yes.

19
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,831
She seems to be studying hard.

20
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:40,583
{\an8}I see.

21
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,668
She calls me occasionally,

22
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,420
but I don't see her in person lately.

23
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:48,382
{\an8}Oh my, is this a friend of yours?

24
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,592
{\an8}Ms. Shinohara!

25
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:50,843
{\an8}He certainly is handsome.

26
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,720
That's right.

27
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:54,472
We met through an online video game.

28
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,265
Such a beautiful face…

29
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,475
He could be an actor.

30
00:00:57,558 --> 00:00:59,852
It makes my heart jump.

31
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,479
I'll be going, now--

32
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,689
I'll be done soon. Wait for me!

33
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:04,940
Let's go home together!

34
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:19,997
ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

35
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:39,827
He's waiting for you
like a real gentleman.

36
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:41,912
Don't tell me he's your boyfriend?

37
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:43,455
No, he's not.

38
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,957
He's uncomfortable around girls,

39
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,709
so it's not like that.

40
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:48,627
Oh, that's a waste.

41
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,505
Still, you like him, don't you?

42
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,674
You tried really hard to keep him here.

43
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:56,510
Uh…

44
00:02:56,594 --> 00:02:58,095
I wonder…

45
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:01,724
Oh, what an innocent response!

46
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,769
<i>It's true that compared</i>
<i>to when we first met,</i>

47
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:09,523
<i>Yamada's a lot more accepting of me now.</i>

48
00:03:09,607 --> 00:03:10,482
KINOSHITA

49
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:14,612
<i>In fact, I get the feeling…</i>

50
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,740
You must be tired.

51
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,241
<i>…that he's a really nice guy.</i>

52
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,743
Thanks for waiting!

53
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,496
<i>We only met on an online game,</i>

54
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,499
<i>so it makes me happy</i>
<i>to know we can become closer.</i>

55
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,128
<i>But that goes</i>

56
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,547
<i>for Eita and Runa too, right?</i>

57
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,261
{\an8}I didn't invite you just for the coupon.

58
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:40,930
The truth is…

59
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,265
I made you lunch to say thanks.

60
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:44,975
I wanted to give it to you.

61
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:46,101
Thanks for what?

62
00:03:46,185 --> 00:03:47,603
For my computer.

63
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,105
I had no chance to thank you,
because of the festival.

64
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,650
It never bothered me.

65
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,445
I've finally broken free
of my money worries,

66
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:58,906
so it's a pretty luxurious meal.

67
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:03,535
<i>I don't really know why,</i>

68
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,789
<i>but I get the feeling</i>
<i>I shouldn't look at him</i>

69
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,416
<i>as a love interest.</i>

70
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,008
Oh no, I sneezed in front
of someone preparing for exams.

71
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:19,677
Do you have a cold?

72
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,053
I wonder…

73
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,972
Did I bring a mask?

74
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,360
Find one?

75
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:37,903
Yes.

76
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,676
I hope your cold doesn't get worse.

77
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,764
Yeah.

78
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:08,600
Thanks.

79
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,861
Men who are kind without realizing it

80
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:21,030
can be terrifying, don't you think?

81
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,616
Go on.

82
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,410
If you're not careful,

83
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,330
you could even start to feel

84
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,706
that they have a crush on you.

85
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,791
But in fact, it's nothing like that.

86
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,127
He's just naturally kind.

87
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,254
It's a terrifying trap.

88
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,257
I have one question.

89
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:43,510
How are you so sure
that there's no chance?

90
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,055
Oh, and can I make
your nails a little flashy?

91
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,306
"Butterfly of the night" style.

92
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,892
Don't. I'll get in trouble at work.

93
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,728
You haven't said who you're talking about,

94
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,938
but I know it's Yamada.

95
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:55,856
I mean,

96
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,776
you were happy when he called you
an unattainable flower, right?

97
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,904
I'm sure that had
no deeper meaning, either.

98
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,907
That's why he's so terrifying.

99
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:09,119
Even if it were a slip of the tongue,
if a hot younger man

100
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,455
said something like that to me,

101
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,415
I'd pounce on him right away.

102
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:16,627
{\an8}I don't know why you're hesitating.

103
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,796
{\an8}It's not hesitation.

104
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,005
Oh?

105
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,801
I feel like this is
the most hesitant I've ever seen you.

106
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:26,512
You enjoy talking about Yamada

107
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,680
and you've been probing his feelings,

108
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,060
but you haven't told me anything
about what you want.

109
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,772
Until you do,

110
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,566
there's not much else I can say.

111
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,987
You're right.

112
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,781
{\an8}-Butterflies of the night!
-I said no.

113
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,075
RUNA SASAKI CALLING

114
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,118
Oh, it's Runa.

115
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,285
Oh, her?

116
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,122
I remember. The junior-high Lolita girl.

117
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:55,040
Yeah, her.

118
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:57,167
<i>Akane, can you meet me right away?!</i>

119
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,419
It's a guild emergency!

120
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:10,431
Runa!

121
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,433
Sorry to keep you waiting!

122
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,645
Should you be walking alone
at this time of night?

123
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,439
It's already getting dark.

124
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,482
It's fine. I came by taxi.

125
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:22,609
I'll go home by taxi too.

126
00:07:22,693 --> 00:07:24,445
Well, that's a relief.

127
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,612
Oh, get this.

128
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:26,780
I ran into Yamada this afternoon--

129
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,533
Did you even read my text?!

130
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,534
Oh, yeah.

131
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,952
I read it.

132
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,704
A new member will enter the guild, huh?

133
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,916
Another unknown woman has joined.

134
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,793
I can't believe this!

135
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:42,504
In the beginning, Eita said
he would keep it between us!

136
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,256
I mean, I like you now, Akane.

137
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,299
<i>She's so territorial…</i>

138
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:46,717
But at this rate,

139
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,218
it'll be a whole new guild soon!

140
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,888
Plus, I don't like
being around other girls!

141
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,348
They always end up hating me!

142
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:55,100
I'm excited, myself.

143
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:58,103
I hope it's a woman
who doesn't know much about video games.

144
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,564
I bought cocoa. Want some?

145
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,482
You're too carefree!

146
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,233
{\an8}So with that in mind…

147
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,903
{\an8}I quickly developed a plan
to drive her away.

148
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,070
{\an8}Bad girl!

149
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,740
Newbies are always nervous,

150
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,034
so we have to give them a good welcome.

151
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,206
Plus, if you get to know them,

152
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:18,582
you might even become friends.

153
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,834
Like you and I did.

154
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:34,598
When I imagine becoming friends
with someone I wouldn't normally meet,

155
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:36,808
I get a bit excited.

156
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,645
That's why I'm against it!

157
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:42,356
You'll just become friends
with the new girl right away!

158
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,901
Then you'll start hanging around
with her more than me!

159
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,402
That's not true.

160
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,779
I've never spoken to her--

161
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,656
Well, it'll happen!

162
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,492
Can't we all just get along?

163
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,701
No! No odd numbers!

164
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,245
Someone will be left out!

165
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,498
Let's all be friends.

166
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,583
Okay?

167
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,300
It's like I've got a jealous girlfriend.

168
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:13,262
I knew…

169
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:15,681
you'd say that.

170
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,351
My brother did too.

171
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,521
The new girl was introduced by Yamada,

172
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,023
so he said I have to welcome her.

173
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,858
By Yamada?

174
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,402
It's a girl from his class.

175
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,531
I've heard she used
to only play FPS games,

176
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,200
but she wants to try MMO
as a change of pace.

177
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,661
They're supposedly close.

178
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,913
{\an8}When I asked what she was like,
over the phone…

179
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,164
Tell me!

180
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,541
{\an8}<i>She's a regular person.</i>

181
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:45,544
{\an8}Yamada wouldn't tell me anything.

182
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,630
But he said if I did anything
like I did to you,

183
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,882
{\an8}that he'd be really mad.

184
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:51,842
{\an8}I HAVEN'T EVEN DONE ANYTHING YET…

185
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:54,052
{\an8}<i>A girl he's close to?</i>

186
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,346
It's unusual that

187
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,557
Yamada is introducing a girl to us…

188
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,184
You're right.

189
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,313
Actually, I have a great idea!

190
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,731
Give me your phone!

191
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,317
{\an8}YAMADA

192
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,319
What are you doing?

193
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,362
I'm adding Yamada's phone number.

194
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,072
You should try calling him!

195
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,700
He didn't trust me,

196
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,328
but if you ask, he might tell you more!

197
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,829
If I know what she's like,

198
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,998
{\an8}it'll be a relief for me.

199
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:23,915
AKITO YAMADA

200
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:25,584
{\an8}CRAM SCHOOL

201
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,588
-After that, they went straight to dating.
-For real?

202
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,591
Didn't they both say the other
wasn't their type?

203
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,886
That may be, but they're
still man and woman.

204
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,429
Even if it seems unlikely,

205
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:40,891
the smallest thing
can bring them together.

206
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:46,980
Can love really begin

207
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,108
from the smallest things?

208
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,778
Hey there, Class President.

209
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,489
Good evening, Okamoto and Yamada…

210
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:56,490
Hi.

211
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:57,616
Say, Ms. President…

212
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,744
Talking to yourself
is a funny way to make an entrance.

213
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,996
Um, I was asking you two a question.

214
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,914
OOPS, SORRY

215
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,582
Love, huh…

216
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,125
How can I put it…

217
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:09,836
{\an8}Aren't we the wrong people to ask?

218
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,213
{\an8}You have a point.

219
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,382
That reminds me, Yamada-kun.

220
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,133
Thanks for the guild introduction.

221
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,469
You talked to the Master, right?

222
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,387
Yeah.

223
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,013
What's she talking about?

224
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,848
Gaming.

225
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:22,891
Oh, FOS?

226
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,935
I started playing recently.

227
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,479
They say it's best
to be in a strong guild,

228
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,315
so I had Yamada-kun introduce me to his.

229
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,526
That's right, you're a secret gamer.

230
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,820
I don't hide it or anything.

231
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:37,864
It's just that I can't talk about
gaming with other girls.

232
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:39,533
All they talk about is romance.

233
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,702
Are you interested
in romance, Ms. President?

234
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,663
Not really.

235
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,252
So you're another one who's dedicating
their life to gaming.

236
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,304
You're not gonna answer?

237
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:02,889
It's an unknown number

238
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,058
and the class is about to start.

239
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,017
INCOMING CALL

240
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,019
Oh, they hung up.

241
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,940
You sure get a lot
of calls like that, Yamada.

242
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,152
I'll bet when you answer,
it's some girl asking you out.

243
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,612
If you ever wanted to, you could--

244
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,156
Yamada-kun

245
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,617
isn't into things like romance, right?

246
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,077
{\an8}SHE STARTLED ME

247
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,705
{\an8}Well, not really.

248
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,463
That's what I thought.

249
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:38,967
I'm hungry!

250
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,844
I'm gonna die of starvation.

251
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,555
Didn't you just eat a hamburger?

252
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,348
A hamburger sounds good.

253
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,349
Again?

254
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,144
I know, I'll get some fries.

255
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,482
Huh? Hey, are you listening?

256
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,983
I have a phone call.

257
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,985
The same number as before?

258
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,653
If it's a girl with a cute voice,

259
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:00,322
then put me on!

260
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,657
Are you ignoring me?

261
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:06,995
AKITO YAMADA CALLING

262
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,788
Coming!

263
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,709
<i>Hello?</i>

264
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,294
Oh, excuse me, I--

265
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,545
<i>Yamada?</i>

266
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,715
It's me, Akane!

267
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:20,425
Akane?

268
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,093
It really was a woman.

269
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,179
Wait, did I tell you my--

270
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:25,180
<i>I know, right?</i>

271
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,098
Sorry about that.

272
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,893
The truth is that I was
with Runa earlier tonight, and…

273
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,897
Are you okay?

274
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,317
<i>I'm fine. Anyway, there's something</i>
<i>I wanted to ask you,</i>

275
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,195
<i>but I have to go to work now.</i>

276
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,405
Didn't you already work?

277
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,076
It seems they can't get a hold
of the person who's on the night shift,

278
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,037
so they called me in suddenly.

279
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,956
<i>Isn't there anyone else?</i>

280
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,666
Apparently not.

281
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,920
<i>Since I live close by, I'm an easy choice.</i>

282
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:57,921
Yeah?

283
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:01,007
You know, Yamada…

284
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,175
<i>Yeah?</i>

285
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,886
<i>He has a deep voice on the phone.</i>

286
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:06,888
Oh, nothing!

287
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,892
WAITING FOR OKAMOTO

288
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,186
Was the person who called

289
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,396
the one from the festival?

290
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:17,148
How did you know?

291
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,442
I heard you call her name.

292
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,320
She's in our guild on FOS.

293
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,407
You'll get to know her too, Tsubaki.

294
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,075
I see.

295
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,412
You all get along well offline too, huh?

296
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,622
I suppose.

297
00:14:32,706 --> 00:14:35,625
The Guild Master
is my neighborhood senpai.

298
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,794
<i>I can't recall…</i>

299
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,170
<i>her face…</i>

300
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,299
What are they like?

301
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,135
Ei-- You mean the Guild Master?

302
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,470
No, this Akane person.

303
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,181
Akane…

304
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,728
My ex-boyfriend…

305
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,687
Is this a one-night stand?

306
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,813
Yamada!

307
00:14:56,897 --> 00:14:59,608
SHE'S ALWAYS MAKING FUNNY FACES…

308
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:03,737
Yamada!

309
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,869
She's hard to describe.

310
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,082
Does that mean…

311
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,210
you like her?

312
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,094
Akane!

313
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,847
Sorry, you're a life-saver!

314
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,183
I can't get a hold of
the person on night shift

315
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,560
and it's impossible
to handle everything myself.

316
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,520
Whoever the culprit is,

317
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,481
you had better fire them.

318
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,316
Right…

319
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,276
But they're a hard person to dislike.

320
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,528
They love the guitar and…

321
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,489
Uh, how about I buy you dinner?

322
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,366
Would tomorrow night be okay?

323
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,034
-I know a good--
-Not a chance!

324
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:52,035
I'LL EAT AT HOME.

325
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,959
With this cold coming on,
I wanted to go to bed early.

328
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,935
<i>Anyway, let's get to work!</i>

329
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,410
<i>You haven't told me anything</i>
<i>about what you want.</i>

00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,122
Coming!

00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,665
<i>Get it together!</i>

333
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,300
WILL YOU LOG INTO THE ARERA 5 SERVER?

00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,664
<i>Forgive me, Akane.</i>

339
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,794
<i>…that I regret.</i>

AKANE CALLING

00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,176
It's Akane!

342
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,929
-Can I answer?
-Go ahead.

343
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,141
What's up, Akane?

344
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,934
I'm in the middle of my lesson.

345
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,188
<i>Runa…</i>

346
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,814
What's with that scary voice?!

347
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,399
A cold?

348
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,568
So then, no gaming today?

349
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:51,071
I see.

350
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,699
It's okay. I understand.

351
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,910
Take care!

352
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,207
Akane has a cold.

353
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,751
She sounded on the verge of death.

354
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,503
I wonder if she's okay.

355
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,089
I hope it's not serious.

QUICK BREAK

365
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,141
<i>I feel awful.</i>

366
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,643

372

<i>I can't just feel sorry for myself.</i>

373
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,572
<i>No one is going to come to my aid.</i>

374
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,991
<i>If I don't act on my own,</i>

375
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,826

376

377
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,331

378
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,334
<i>Gotta go to the store…</i>

383
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:45,560
<i>Okay…</i>

384
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,061
<i>At least my brain is working.</i>

385
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,483
<i>I just have to…</i>
<i>get through the night, somehow.</i>

386
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,297
<i>I can't ride a bike right now!</i>

387
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,049

<i>I'm burning up…</i>

389
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:20,845
<i>Wait, couldn't I just order out?</i>

390
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:23,097
<i>Why didn't I think of that before?</i>

391
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,017
<i>Yeah. There's delivery.</i>

392
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,186
<i>Good thinking.</i>

393
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:29,520
<i>But first…</i>

394
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:32,523
<i>I have to stand my bike back up.</i>

395
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:36,152
<i>Then, I'll go back to my room and…</i>

396
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,530
<i>What was I gonna do, again?</i>

397
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:44,035
<i>My head hurts.</i>

398

<i>But then…</i>

402
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,813
<i>there's no way he's at my apartment.</i>

403
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:13,856
Can you hear me?

404
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:16,985
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

405
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,070
<i>Oh, man…</i>

406
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:24,033
<i>I'm even seeing him in my dreams now.</i>

407
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,121
<i>I'm sorry, Yamada.</i>

408
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,749
