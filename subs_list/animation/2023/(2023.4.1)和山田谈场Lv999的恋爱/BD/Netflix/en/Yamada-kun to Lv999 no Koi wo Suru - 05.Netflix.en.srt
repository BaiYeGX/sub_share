1
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,579
-Yes?
<i>-Guess who?</i>

2
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,122
TEE-HEE!

3
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,082
Hello, Eita.

4
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,209
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

5
00:00:42,293 --> 00:00:44,628
I was calibrating my mouse.

6
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:45,713
You sure are carefree.

7
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:46,630
*CALIBRATING MEANS ADJUSTING
MOUSE SENSITIVITY

8
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,551
<i>Anyway, you're coming over today, right?</i>

9
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:51,761
<i>For Runa's lesson?</i>

10
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,431
So then the schedule hasn't changed?

11
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,725
Not that I know of.

12
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,185
When you come over,

13
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,228
can you bring that manga we talked about?

14
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,313
I really wanna read it.

15
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,439
<i>Sure.</i>

16
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,941
Yay! You're the best, Yamada.

17
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:09,570
Okay, see you then.

18
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,577
Sure! Next Saturday, huh?

19
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,412
Sounds good.

20
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:20,956
Runa wants to hang out with me!

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,208
I'm glad.

22
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,419
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 3RD

23
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:42,019
ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

24
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,849
My, my…

25
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,143
I never imagined Princess Ruri's player

26
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:07,980
would be a real, charming young lady.

27
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,190
Based on past experience,

28
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,736
I was 100% certain
that the player was a man.

29
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,240
Of course, I was still
prepared to love them,

30
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:20,910
but behold, a genuine specimen
of blooming female beauty.

31
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:24,663
It seems I still have much to learn.

32
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,084
Um…

33
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,003
I hate to go over this again.

34
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,297
-I'm not Princess Ruri--
-Furthermore.

35
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,634
I never dreamed that I would
actually be able to meet you.

36
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,551
When I heard

37
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,845
that you were playing FOS
as Princess Ruri,

38
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:42,139
I followed and switched
from the previous game,

39
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,516
but to think you were aware of me.

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,018
Maintaining her adorable charm

41
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,020
and immediately reaching high rank,

42
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,271
no matter what the game,

43
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,273
is the Princess Ruri way.

44
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:53,525
As a fan, you've always made me proud.

45
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,527
SORRY, I'LL BE LATE

46
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:56,528
BUT A FRIEND WILL BE THERE

47
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:00,032
Your latest achievements
have been no different.

48
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,034
If it would not be an affront…

49
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:05,788
-Umm…
-I would like to join your guild.

50
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,582
Sorry, I need to use the restroom!

51
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,501
Very well.

52
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,056
<i>What's going on?</i>

53
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:28,560
<i>Runa hasn't come</i>

54
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:33,899
<i>and a stranger was at our meeting point.</i>

55
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:35,526
<i>Princess Ruri!</i>

56
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,069
<i>You're Princess Ruri, are you not?</i>

57
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,531
-Princess Ruri!
<i>-He's convinced I'm Princess Ruri.</i>

58
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,575
-Princess Ruri!
<i>-And he won't listen to a word I say!</i>

59
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,711
<i>Coming!</i>

60
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,755
Welcome, Yamada-kun.

61
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:57,673
Hello.

62
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,925
You're as handsome as ever.

63
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,972
Runa's locked away in her room
playing games all day.

64
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:09,184
I worry whether she'll actually
pass the exam for your high school.

65
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:12,646
Runa!

66
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,190
"Professor" Yamada is here.

67
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:16,525
Yamada!

68
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,569
Hi.

69
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,904
I'll let you two get to it!

70
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:21,822
Right.

71
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,657
Don't slack off now, Runa.

72
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,159
I'm not!

73
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,831
I did all the pages you told me to.

74
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,708
Look!

75
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,335
Runa, today…

76
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:35,461
{\an8}MATHEMATICS

77
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:39,089
Don't you have somewhere else to be?

78
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,425
What do you mean?

79
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,723
Well,

80
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,600
if I'm wrong, then that's fine.

81
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,397
{\an8}CALL FROM AKANE

82
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,110
How could I have anywhere else to be?

83
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,616
CALLING RUNA SASAKI

84
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,329
<i>No answer…</i>

85
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,376
<i>I'm in a fix.</i>

86
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:21,215
<i>Lunch alone with a total stranger…</i>

87
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,385
Excuse me, Princess Ruri.

88
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,685
I apologize for the intrusion,

89
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,230
but is that you in there, Princess Ruri?

90
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,733
<i>This is the women's restroom.</i>

91
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:40,776
<i>Is this for real?</i>

92
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,404
Princess Ruri, are you all right?

93
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,660
I, uh… have a stomachache.

94
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,162
Also, this is the women's rest--

95
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,413
I knew it.

96
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:55,249
-It's as I expected.
<i>-Um…</i>

97
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,709
-When you didn't return, I worried.
<i>-This is…</i>

98
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,629
-I thought you might have collapsed.
<i>-Damn it…</i>

99
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,547
Excuse me,

100
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,133
but I do believe
this is the women's restroom!

101
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,014
Princess Ruri,

102
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,559
would you mind opening the door?

103
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:16,812
If you could, please.

104
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,440
Princess Ruri…

105
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,987
It's not that big a deal.

106
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,322
She's probably gone home already.

107
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,576
In other words, you stood her up.

108
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,744
It's nothing like that.

109
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:36,415
I had someone from the online game
go instead of me.

110
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:37,583
From the online game?

111
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,420
This guy who's a big fan
of Eita's character.

112
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,255
I invited him through Eita's account,

113
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,715
and he was really excited.

114
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,262
Where are you going, Yamada?

115
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,014
Where did you agree to meet?

116
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,098
Why do you ask?

117
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,017
Why…?

118
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,519
This is way too dangerous.
I'd better check on her.

119
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,062
What about my lesson?

120
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,190
I'll be right back.
Continue with your textbook.

121
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,107
Wait!

122
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,487
You startled me.

123
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,406
{\an8}I thought it was suddenly an auto door.

124
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,407
{\an8}I BROUGHT SNACKS

125
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,492
{\an8}Eita…

126
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,167
Something wrong?

127
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:28,592
Whoa, she really did contact
someone through my account.

128
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,636
Talk about a mean trick.

129
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,554
Where did they agree to meet?

130
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,352
Let's see…

131
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:40,145
Oh, it's close by.

132
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,190
About 15 minutes by car.

133
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,871
<i>Why…?</i>

134
00:08:58,664 --> 00:08:59,748
<i>Runa!</i>

135
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:04,920
<i>Runa…</i>

136
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,136
<i>Runa! What shall we play today?</i>

137
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:20,018
<i>Why can't things just stay as they are?</i>

138
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,780
{\an8}Is it true?!

139
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,491
Akane was kidnapped

140
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:36,535
by a criminal organization?!

141
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:41,707
A-Aka-Aka…

142
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,875
I may have exaggerated a little.

143
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,255
Akane!

144
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:50,799
Thanks for driving us, Mr. Kamota.

145
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:54,136
Mr. Kamota, you needed to turn right
at that intersection.

146
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,846
{\an8}SAFE DRIVING AMULET

147
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,727
Mr. Kamota, we're going the wrong way.

148
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,983
When we find Akane, you have to apologize.

149
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:08,984
No way!

150
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,238
Stop behaving like this.

151
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:16,867
This is exactly why you can't
make friends at school.

152
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,368
Who needs them?

153
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:21,371
I have 300 friends on the Internet.

154
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,958
Akane! What do we do, Yamada-kun?!

155
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,127
Mr. Kamota, keep your eyes on the road.

156
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,885
All anyone cares about is Akane.
It's so stupid.

157
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,471
In the first place,
why did you let her in our guild

158
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,806
without asking me?

159
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,766
Look…

160
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:41,767
IT'S MY GUILD, YOU KNOW.

161
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,603
When long-time users keep newbies out,

162
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,023
content only gets worse.

163
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,233
Be more welcoming.

164
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,401
What do you mean?

165
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:55,822
Akane…

166
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:58,408
was trying to be friends
with you, wasn't she?

167
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,413
<i>Next Saturday, huh?</i>

168
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,083
<i>Sounds good.</i>

169
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:15,801
{\an8}24-HOUR PARKING
EMPTY

170
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,969
Okay, shall we split up and look?

171
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,722
Akane!

172
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,557
Mr. Kamota, you're heavy.

173
00:11:22,641 --> 00:11:25,560
Wh-wh-wh-where…

174
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,812
-Found her.
-That was quick!

175
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,146
How did you know?

176
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:34,403
Still, something…

177
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,655
seems off.

178
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,410
Aka--

179
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,912
Akane!

180
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:48,166
Aka-Aka-Aka…

181
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,960
Akane!

182
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,586
I'm so glad you're all right!

183
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,046
Mr. Kamota?

184
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:54,965
Everything's fine.

185
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,050
Just leave the rest to the adults.

186
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,887
And who might you be?

187
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,889
I'm the President
of Kamota Strawberry Farm,

188
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:04,850
Takezo Kamota!

189
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:07,310
I have friends who are lawyers!

190
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,439
Violence and blackmail
are useless against me!

191
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,024
We'll fight our battles in court!

192
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,486
Akane, are you okay?

193
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,322
Eita!

194
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,657
Yamada too?

195
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,826
What are you guys doing here?

196
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,162
Runa said she invited a stranger,

197
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:27,414
so we came to check if you were okay.

198
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,251
What happened to your leg?

199
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:34,004
Oh, that's…

200
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,797
My apologies. It was my fault.

201
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,426
I surprised her
in the women's restroom and--

202
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,845
Tell me everything.

203
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:42,929
You're too close.

204
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:49,519
<i>I surmised that Princess Ruri</i>
<i>may have fainted in the restroom</i>

205
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,397
<i>and attempted to deliver her medicine.</i>

206
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,487
Princess Ruri,

207
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,739
are you unable to open the door?

208
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,741
In that case…

209
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,534
I'll pass them under.

210
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:05,452
{\an8}PAINKILLERS

211
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,460
Princess Ruri?

212
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:14,669
Princess Ruri!

213
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,129
{\an8}INCREDIBLE PAIN
PAINKILLERS

214
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,006
That sums it up.

215
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,716
She overreacted in surprise,

216
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,011
and hit a weak spot against the toilet.

217
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,764
Anyone would be surprised by that!

218
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,599
That's strange.

219
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,018
My mother taught me that when a female

220
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:33,396
locks herself in the bathroom, you should
stay quiet and slip her painkillers.

221
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,358
Don't apply your twisted upbringing
to the rest of the world!

222
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,652
Also, stay out of the women's restroom!

223
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:40,987
You are a rather uncouth fellow.

224
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,740
What's your relationship
with Princess Ruri?

225
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,784
You're the one person I won't tell.

226
00:13:46,535 --> 00:13:48,620
<i>Are we done yet?</i>

227
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:55,043
Yo!

228
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,798
You came to check on me?

229
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,591
Thanks a lot.

230
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,052
No, forgive me.

231
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,180
Why are you apologizing?

232
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:08,181
Well…

233
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,142
If I had told you I was
tutoring Runa today…

234
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,437
You're her tutor?

235
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,480
Yes.

236
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,606
I see.

237
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,276
That's why Runa couldn't come.

238
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,737
-Um, I'm not sure--
-So that's all it was!

239
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,608
Runa?

240
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,775
Runa!

241
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:03,612
<i>The pain…</i>

242
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,280
It hurts!

243
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:26,468
You're… injured?

244
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,350
-I'm sorry.
-Runa!

245
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:37,938
Come with me.

246
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,606
You're in for a scolding.

247
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:45,862
Don't look to me for help.

248
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:48,782
What you did was really dangerous.

249
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,158
Please learn your lesson.

250
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,535
Let's go.

251
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,044
Ow…

252
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,713
Ow-ow-ow!

253
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,548
Akane?

254
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,300
My stomach hurts, suddenly.

255
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:09,219
Your stomach? Not your leg?

256
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,639
Oh, uh…

257
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,225
The pain may be spreading, or…

258
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,146
Perhaps you should administer
the pills I gave you earlier?

259
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,066
You're not to speak to Akane!

260
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,484
<i>He's still here?</i>

261
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,485
{\an8}HMM…

262
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,903
{\an8}Not those.

263
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,114
{\an8}Those won't help.

264
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,533
Only Class-1 anti-inflammation pills

265
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,869
from the drug store will do.

266
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,746
Class… huh?

267
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,374
If you walk 500 meters toward the station,

268
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,501
there'll be a drugstore on your right.

269
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,294
Right. We'll go right away.

270
00:16:43,378 --> 00:16:44,504
I'll go.

271
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,592
Rub my belly.

272
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:53,596
Oh, and I worry that Eita
can't find them alone.

273
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,141
Yamada and Mr. Kamota, please go with him.

274
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,309
As for you, please go home!

275
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:39,684
So Runa, what's your level?

276
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,441
Sorry, I mean in-game.

277
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:47,525
Um…

278
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:50,195
I've maxed out twice and since then…

279
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,365
Oh, then I guess we can't hunt together.

280
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:56,242
I'm still low-level.

281
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,204
It won't work if there's
a gap in levels, right?

282
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,290
I invited Yamada once,
but he turned me down.

283
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:04,125
You want to hunt together?

284
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,503
Our levels are too far apart.

285
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,713
The experience penalties are a pain.

286
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,716
It doesn't bother me.

287
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,677
Actually, I have low-level characters too.

288
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,723
Then let's hunt together some time!

289
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,935
My class is Paladin.

290
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,729
-But what's--
-How can you talk to me like that?

291
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,564
Didn't you think it was strange

292
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:27,774
that I never came?

293
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,777
Oh, uh, well…

294
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,947
I stood you up on purpose!

295
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,615
I wanted to cause you trouble.

296
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,284
I don't like you, after all!

297
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,745
I wanted you to leave the guild!

298
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,622
I thought that if I set you up

299
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:45,458
with a weird guy,
you'd start hating online games.

300
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,504
I did think it was strange, but…

301
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:52,048
NOW I GET IT…

302
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,597
You're… injured?

303
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,566
I think I'll leave the lecture

304
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,609
to your brother.

305
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:18,658
After all, I came today
to make friends with you.

306
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:23,079
Everyone's so nice.

307
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:28,168
I've been thinking lately of how glad
I am to have joined this guild.

308
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,088
But the other members
are important companions to you, right?

309
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,383
That's why…

310
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,219
I wanted to ask you to let me be
your companion too.

311
00:19:38,303 --> 00:19:39,929
What do you say, Runa?

312
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,371
I'm so sorry.

313
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:12,170
I'm sorry I was mean to you!

314
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:27,393
Puberty is tough on girls, huh?

315
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,731
I didn't expect her to butt heads
with Akane like this.

316
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,942
I'm at my wit's end!

317
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:37,278
She was so cute and well-behaved
when she was younger.

318
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,657
What should I do?

319
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:00,760
Welcome back!

320
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,888
{\an8}MEDICINE

321
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,975
Akane, is your stomach feeling better?

322
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,935
Huh? Oh, yeah…

323
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,520
I'm fine now.

324
00:21:11,229 --> 00:21:13,898
Maybe Runa rubbing my belly helped.

325
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,665
It's unfortunate.

326
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,086
You were looking forward
to today, weren't you?

327
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,046
And yet Runa tricked you.

328
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:03,257
Well, once I saw

329
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,926
that there was a stranger here,

330
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,720
I should have gone straight home.

331
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,806
I'm a little irritated, of course.

332
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,476
But I'm more disappointed
that we didn't get to hang out.

333
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:17,313
Still, just watch.

334
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,524
I'm not the best at romance,

335
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,901
but I'm pretty good

336
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,778
at getting along with other girls.

337
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,697
So I'm sure we'll be friends.

338
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:27,865
Eventually…

339
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,452
You live up
to expectations, Princess Ruri.

340
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,162
I'd heard rumors of your generosity,

341
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,664
but you truly are a muse.

342
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,416
Please honor me by dating
with the expectation of marr--

343
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,709
Go home, already!

344
00:23:38,793 --> 00:23:39,919
