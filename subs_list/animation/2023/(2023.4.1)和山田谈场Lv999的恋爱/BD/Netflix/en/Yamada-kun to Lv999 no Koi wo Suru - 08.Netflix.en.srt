{\an8}THE 53RD TOSEI FESTIVAL

2
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,345
Sorry to keep you waiting!

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,263
There she is.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,807
Akane, you're late!

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,392
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:24,316
I got called into a night shift
suddenly at my part-time job.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,320
After that, I had a report to write.
I've barely slept.

8
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:29,530
Seriously?

9
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:33,034
Convenience stores can be tough
when they're short staffed.

10
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:34,201
Hey there!

11
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:35,953
Everyone!

12
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:38,164
Let's get started!

13
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:39,123
He's so cute!

14
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,624
Just adorable!

15
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,042
-Is that guy wearing rabbit ears
-Hey!

16
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:44,503
and lost in his own world, Eita?

17
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,505
They're even taking photos of him.

18
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:49,258
Eita loves festivals.

19
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:51,177
SO CUTE!

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,137
Hey, wait!

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,221
Wait, you guys!

22
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:56,307
Hey! I'm over here!

23
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:00,144
{\an8}COME SEE OUR COSPLAY CAFE

24
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,819
<i>So this is Yamada's school.</i>

ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

26
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:43,873
{\an8}CREPE

27
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:47,334
{\an8}There are so many booths!

28
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:50,129
Runa, is there anything you want to eat?

29
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:51,547
I don't need anything.

30
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,971
Runa wants to take
the entrance exam here next year.

31
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:00,973
She's really nervous.

32
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,393
Just relax, Runa!

33
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,562
It's a chance to get
used to the environment!

34
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:08,606
With my fear of failure, it's impossible.

35
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,653
TRICK ART
PERFECT FOR SOCIAL MEDIA

36
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,488
{\an8}Welcome!

37
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:20,993
Whoa! Let's check that out!

38
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,828
Let's go in! I wanna!

39
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,039
Do you hear me? I wanna go inside…

40
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,498
<i>Go right ahead!</i>

41
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,877
<i>Now admitting a party of two!</i>

42
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,340
So where shall we go, then?

{\an8}COSPLAY CAFE

45
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,810
My stomach hurts.

46
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,524
I'm so nervous, my stomach hurts.

47
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,443
I'm done for.

48
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,862
At this rate, I'll never be tough enough--

49
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,530
Okay. stop.

50
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:00,241
Let's use the restroom.

51
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,461
<i>Mr. Kamota and I just</i>
<i>left the haunted house!</i>

52
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:14,129
<i>Let's reconvene</i>

53
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,673
<i>in about 15 minutes.</i>

54
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:18,092
<i>"Okay."</i>

55
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,013
<i>That reminds me,</i>
<i>will Yamada be able to join us?</i>

56
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,932
<i>Let's ask.</i>

57
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,853
<i>Wait…</i>

58
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:34,066
<i>This almost makes it seem</i>
<i>like I want to meet up with him.</i>

59
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,485
<i>Well, I guess I don't need to ask.</i>

60
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,445
<i>I'll find out later, anyway.</i>

61
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,074
-That startled me!
-Are you all right?

62
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,867
They fell down!

63
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:44,827
Oh man…

64
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,287
Is everyone okay?

65
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,329
We'll handle this.

66
00:04:47,413 --> 00:04:48,580
Thank you!

67
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,376
Let's bring them inside.

68
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,587
-Yamada--
-Yamada!

69
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:58,757
The freshmen are playing fighting games

70
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,551
and Yoshida from debate club took part.

71
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,845
You should have seen his ridiculous moves!

72
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,932
<i>Somehow…</i>

73
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,310
{\an8}<i>it's a little hard to interrupt.</i>

74
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,436
{\an8}HAND IS STUCK IN MID-WAVE

75
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,938
<i>-Maybe he'll turn around.</i>
-Taking those inside?

76
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,023
I'll help.

77
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,692
<i>Hey, Yamada!</i>

78
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:20,237
<i>He went inside.</i>

79
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,244
<i>Well, it can't be helped.</i>

80
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:28,704
<i>He looks busy.</i>

81
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,372
<i>There's no reason he'd notice me.</i>

82
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,210
<i>Give me a break…</i>

83
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,424
I told them to start cleaning up
the used boxes.

84
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,342
But they just left them there.

85
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,429
They're not the most reliable bunch.

86
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:46,597
Tsubaki,

87
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,182
can I step out?

88
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,975
Sure, but…

89
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:50,976
Where are you going?

90
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:53,145
Not far.

91
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,486
<i>This is taking a while.</i>

92
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,114
<i>Maybe I should take a look.</i>

93
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,669
Are you on your own?

94
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,845
Oh, you uh… noticed me?

95
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:28,514
Yeah.

96
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,100
I was going to call out to you,

97
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,559
but an accident happened.

98
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:37,606
But why are you here alone?

99
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:41,985
Why…

100
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,822
are you smiling?

101
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,326
Oh, no reason.

102
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,047
Runa was with me,

103
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:03,549
but she got nervous

104
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:06,552
and went to the bathroom.

105
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,221
It's been a while,
so I'm a little worried.

106
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,932
I was about to go check on her.

107
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,147
<i>It's no use.</i>

108
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:21,942
<i>I'll never survive the actual exam</i>
<i>if I'm this nervous already.</i>

109
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,652
You don't have a fever.

110
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,279
Why don't you lie down for a while?

111
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,196
WHY AM I SUCH A COWARD…

112
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,742
Yamada, what are you doing?

113
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,036
I'm texting Eita--

114
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,037
No!

115
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,497
You can't!

116
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:36,748
Don't tell Eita!

117
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,500
He'll just make me go home!

118
00:07:38,584 --> 00:07:39,501
Yeah, but I can't--

119
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,420
I haven't had any tasty food yet,

120
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,088
or had any fun at all!

121
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,090
Doesn't your stomach hurt?

122
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:47,217
There are a whole bunch
of foods I want to try!

123
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,596
To prepare, I haven't eaten anything
since last night!

124
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,931
Maybe that's why!

125
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,100
In that case, I'll go buy some things.

126
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,978
Get better soon, so you're able to eat!

127
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:02,900
In that case…

128
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:04,902
A crepe,

129
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,111
a cheese dog,

130
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:07,321
takoyaki,

131
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:11,325
and lastly, I'd like to try
the <i>tonjiru</i> soup I saw in the courtyard.

132
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:14,828
Oh, and I definitely want
the commemorative festival t-shirt.

133
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,330
Sure!

134
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,749
{\an8}Where do they sell the t-shirts?

135
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,833
{\an8}I'll show you.

136
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,710
Come back soon!

137
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:30,093
Are you sure you don't have to help
your classmates, Yamada?

138
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,595
-Hey, look!
-Over there…

139
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,596
Yeah.

140
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,224
I had planned on ending
my shift in the afternoon.

141
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:36,934
Oh, I'm glad.

142
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,895
My work is all behind the scenes,

143
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:41,813
so during the event, I'm free.

144
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:46,902
What did your class do for the event?

145
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:51,240
We teamed up with the class next door
and built a giant maze outside.

146
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,991
Say…

147
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,869
{\an8}Everyone's looking at us, aren't they?

148
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:57,079
ON PINS AND NEEDLES

149
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,330
{\an8}You noticed?

150
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,873
{\an8}Good.

151
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,583
<i>I might get stabbed from behind.</i>

152
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:02,876
<i>Better walk ahead of him.</i>

153
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,420
Excuse me, sir.

154
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,966
Oh, well if it isn't Yamada!

155
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,676
Wandering around over here?

156
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,720
I've heard you're finally
participating in the Mr. Academy contest.

157
00:09:13,804 --> 00:09:16,640
Couldn't escape all three years, huh?

158
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,364
Oh, and what's this? You brought a girl?

159
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:34,533
It always annoyed me

160
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,493
that you ignored the attention you get,

161
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,453
but I guess I had you wrong.

162
00:09:38,537 --> 00:09:41,373
Well, Yamada? Come on!

163
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,709
You don't look familiar.

164
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,502
What high school do you go to?

165
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,672
Actually, I'm a university stu--

166
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:49,631
An older woman?!

167
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:50,591
An older woman?

168
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:51,883
-Now I see!
-She's older?

169
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,303
You like older women, huh?

170
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:55,554
Way to go!

171
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,599
You've made Sensei proud!

172
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:00,767
He would…

173
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,520
make a good gym teacher.

174
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,230
He is the gym teacher.

175
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,524
{\an8}AT A LOSS FOR WORDS

176
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,402
Yamada!

177
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,491
Is she your girlfriend?!

178
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,784
How long have you been dating?

179
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:18,827
Who is she?

180
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,120
You really like older women?

181
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,371
Who are they?

182
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,873
Freshmen, I think.

183
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,458
Judging by the color of their shoes.

184
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,627
Youthful energy is amazing.

185
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,588
Excuse me, girls… you've got it wrong.

186
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,966
<i>You really aren't dating?</i>

187
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,884
<i>Is it true?</i>

188
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,844
<i>So then, why are you together?</i>

189
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,763
{\an8}<i>Yamada, tell us why!</i>

190
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:38,930
{\an8}<i>Who is she?</i>

191
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,016
{\an8}<i>It's a lie that you like</i>
<i>older women, right?</i>

192
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,142
{\an8}<i>What are you doing?</i>

193
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,775
{\an8}<i>We finally made it outside.</i>

194
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:50,942
{\an8}TIRED…
SUBJECTED TO INTERROGATION

195
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,611
{\an8}<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

196
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:53,654
TOO OLD FOR THIS…

197
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,322
Hey there!

198
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,908
Oh, Akito is here too.

199
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,369
We bought a whole bunch of stuff!

200
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:06,416
Runa has a stomachache, again?

201
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,584
Huh?

202
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:09,586
Have you aged suddenly?

203
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,046
Listen to this, both of you!

204
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,465
You won't believe what
we went through to get out here!

205
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,468
I bet the students raised a fuss

206
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:18,678
because Akito brought a girl to school.

207
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:20,722
The same thing happened to Runa last year.

208
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:23,683
It was no joke!
I could feel every eye on me!

209
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,604
{\an8}The fact that I'm not his girlfriend
only makes it worse.

210
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,980
I'm sorry I missed it.

211
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:31,066
I'd have loved seeing you

212
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,192
destroy all their hopes.

213
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,694
That's not it!
It's a misunderstanding, right?

214
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,490
Well… if you're gonna get
glared at, either way…

215
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,117
Take advantage.

216
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,537
Why don't you start dating for real?

217
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,791
TAKE ADVANTAGE.

218
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,335
{\an8}WHY DON'T YOU START DATING FOR REAL?

219
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:51,837
Right, Akito?

220
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,886
Well, I guess…

221
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,555
you have a point.

222
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:02,556
What?!

223
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,892
-Akane's got such a bright personality.
-What are you--

224
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,018
Yeah.

225
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,937
And you share online games as a hobby!

226
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,772
-You can't just--
-Yeah.

227
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,358
A couple it is!

228
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,693
Just kidding!

229
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,909
Akane…?

230
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,459
S-Sorry!

231
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,752
It was just a joke!

232
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,797
I'm really sorry!

233
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:38,175
I was just teasing Akito.

234
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,343
Oh, a j… joke?

235
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:41,261
Sorry!

236
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,811
I have to go shop at the booths!

237
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,021
Runa needs her lunch!

238
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,648
-Akane…
-Akane!

239
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,570
I hate you, Eita!

240
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,658
And don't you
make fun of me either, Yamada!

241
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,578
Damn it!

242
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,288
<i>This is bad.</i>

243
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:11,458
<i>Akane got caught in the middle</i>
<i>of my teasing Akito…</i>

244
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:13,043
You two wait here.

245
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,503
I'm gonna apologize--

246
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,109
<i>In that case…</i>

247
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,446
Take advantage.

248
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,948
Why don't you start dating for real?

249
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,243
"Yeah, yeah. Very funny."

250
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,370
<i>That's what I should have said!</i>

251
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,708
<i>And yet, why…</i>

252
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,210
TOSEI

253
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,924
<i>Why did I react in that dumb way?!</i>

254
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,426
<i>Yamada…</i>

255
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,595
<i>looked really stunned.</i>

256
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:08,974
<i>How humiliating!</i>

257
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,725
{\an8}RETRO CAFE

258
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:12,811
Oh… I'm sorry.

259
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:13,728
STARE

260
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,898
Please walk slowly in the hallway.

261
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,067
{\an8}Yamada?!

262
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,736
Hey, wait…

263
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,030
Don't run!

264
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,288
Hey, Yamada…

265
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:32,497
She's your guest, isn't--

266
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,878
Akane!

267
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,130
Please stop for a moment.

268
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,352
The stairs could be dangerous.

269
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,108
Stop her from running, okay?

270
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,037
I'm sorry about back there.

271
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,538
My name…

272
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,749
You said it for the first time!

273
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,377
No, I don't think--

274
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,923
It is true! That was
definitely the first time!

275
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:25,300
I mean… you've gone so long
without using it

276
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:28,511
that I'd developed a theory

277
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,180
that you didn't even know my name!

278
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,348
That's ridiculous.

279
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,851
-Anyway, um…
-Yamada's talking to a girl.

280
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,853
About what just happened…

281
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,271
Who's that?

282
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,689
It can't be true.

283
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,483
Why's she here?

284
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,487
It's that woman.

285
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,364
Come with me!

286
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,452
Sorry to pull you
into an empty hallway like this.

287
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,705
I was worried about a knife in the back.

288
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,374
Do you really think that?

289
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,168
OKAY, NO ONE AROUND…

290
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,379
I'm sorry for my behavior back there.

291
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,967
It was never my intention
to make fun of you.

292
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,262
I just figured it was another
one of Eita's jokes

293
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:12,764
and I just--

294
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:13,723
Hold on!

295
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,517
I'm not angry or anything.

296
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,227
Let's just drop the subject.

297
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,230
You're… not angry?

298
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,191
But you were clearly mad just now.

299
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:25,151
I wasn't! I mean it!

300
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,570
It was more like…

301
00:16:28,238 --> 00:16:32,033
I was a little embarrassed.

302
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,244
That's why, I…

303
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,161
HE'S SORRY…

304
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,913
had to say something…

305
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:41,584
Pardon the question,

306
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,129
but what was it that embarrassed you?

307
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,423
Let's not go there, okay?

308
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,759
So, then…

309
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,594
you really aren't angry?

310
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,266
I told you, I'm not--

311
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:01,521
I'm glad.

312
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,284
Shall we go do your shopping then?

313
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,162
If, by chance…

314
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:23,001
If I had taken Eita's joke seriously

315
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,463
and said that I would date you…

316
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:32,010
If I had done that…

317
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:34,596
what would you…

318
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:36,639
have done?

319
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,460
J… Just kidding!

320
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:09,089
There are some girls who might
react that way,

321
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,509
so it's best not to make jokes
about people's love lives!

322
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:13,718
Is that clear?

323
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,929
-Yes.
-Okay, then let's go!

324
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,100
<i>I must be losing my mind.</i>

325
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:21,518
But if you had,

326
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,853
I think that would be…

327
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,189
a real honor.

328
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:35,365
It's just that for a boring guy like me,

329
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,701
someone like you
is an unattainable flower,

330
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,121
so I'd never given it much thought.

331
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,082
Yamada!

332
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:48,586
Huh? Do you mean that?

333
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,754
THAT'S A FUNNY THING TO SAY…

334
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:50,797
Yeah.

335
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,927
That's how you think of me?

336
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,679
Yeah.

337
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,560
So what do you need to buy, again?

338
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,691
Hold on, wait for me!

339
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:13,194
A crepe, a cheese dog,

340
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:15,446
takoyaki, and soup.

341
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,493
Also, you're more interesting
than you think.

342
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,620
Really?

343
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:01,010
Please Yamada, you have to enter
the contest this year!

344
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,971
No, I really can't.

345
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:04,764
Don't be so hesitant.

346
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,975
Just look! In the hall!

347
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,229
-See?
-No way.

348
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,690
Please! This is our last chance!

349
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:17,110
We want to make our last
school festival the best it can be!

350
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,861
Yeah, please!

351
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:21,072
A handsome face comes with worries, huh?

352
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,324
Plus, he's good at video games too.

353
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,535
-It's like a cheat code.
-Come on!

354
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:29,789
Shouldn't we put a stop to this?

355
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,499
ONE DAY UNTIL THE TOSEI FESTIVAL

356
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,710
It can't be helped.

357
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,754
Okay, I'm in!

358
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,177
Okamoto, you can't just--

359
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:45,138
Leave it to me, okay?

360
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:48,891
THE DAY OF THE FESTIVAL

361
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:52,395
{\an8}<i>And now, the moment you've all</i>
<i>been waiting for!</i>

362
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:56,024
{\an8}<i>After two years of refusing,</i>

363
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,568
<i>a certain boy is finally going to appear!</i>

364
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,320
TOSEI FESTIVAL MR. ACADEMY CONTEST

365
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,407
