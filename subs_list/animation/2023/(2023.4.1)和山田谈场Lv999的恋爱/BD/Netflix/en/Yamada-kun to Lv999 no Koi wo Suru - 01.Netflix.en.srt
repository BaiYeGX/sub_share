1
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:14,807
Akane, I'm sorry…

2
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:17,852
I've…

3
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,395
found someone else.

4
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:29,613
<i>Well…</i>

5
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:35,494
<i>I did think he was acting distant, lately.</i>

6
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:52,052
ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

7
00:02:10,089 --> 00:02:10,923
<i>What?!</i>

8
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,634
A girl from an online game
stole your boyfriend?!

9
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:17,763
Seriously? That's hilarious!

10
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,765
Momo, not so loud…

11
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,891
When you say game,

12
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:24,353
{\an8}you mean the PC game
you were playing together, right?

13
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,521
{\an8}That's the one.

14
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,233
I never knew that sort of thing
happened in video games.

15
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:31,610
<i>Akane!</i>

16
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:35,114
<i>Why don't you play this game too?</i>

17
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,866
<i>Huh? What is it?</i>

18
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:38,868
<i>It's the newest online game.</i>

19
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:43,247
I did worry he was too much of a gamer,

20
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,167
but I never thought gaming
would lead him to cheat on me.

21
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,253
Worse, this was the last text he sent me.

22
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,008
Yikes, that stings.

23
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:56,135
No words for that one.

24
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,305
You're better off without him.

25
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:00,890
I FORGOT TO MENTION… CAN YOU RETURN
THE ARMOR I LOANED YOU? IT'S SUPER RARE.

26
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:04,226
It might hurt now, but…

27
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,479
I have a lecture this afternoon. Gotta go.

28
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,692
Don't stay down in the dumps forever

29
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,444
and make sure you come to class.

30
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,697
Being a hermit
will only make things worse.

31
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,423
<i>I know…</i>

32
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:37,551
<i>Getting dumped doesn't mean I'm gonna die.</i>

33
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,261
<i>Daily life goes on</i>

34
00:03:39,345 --> 00:03:41,513
<i>and I can't afford to skip class.</i>

35
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,182
<i>I'd like a part-time job too.</i>

36
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,187
<i>I wonder if he actually</i>
<i>retrieved the armor.</i>

37
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:55,778
{\an8}MAINTENANCE NOTIFICATION

38
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:58,697
{\an8}<i>I never had any interest in games…</i>

39
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,617
<i>but if we could enjoy it together,</i>

40
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,285
<i>I was happy to play along.</i>

41
00:04:03,369 --> 00:04:04,203
SELECT CHARACTER: AKANE, PALADIN

42
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,081
<i>He even deleted me from his friends list.</i>

43
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,041
<i>He doesn't miss a beat.</i>

44
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,125
<i>More importantly…</i>

45
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,962
<i>If I knew we were gonna break up,</i>
<i>I could've saved money.</i>

46
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,839
<i>I spent 3,000 yen on my in-game costume.</i>

47
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,051
{\an8}<i>All I'm left with is this waste</i>
<i>of a character I built up.</i>

48
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,512
{\an8}Strike!

49
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,181
Power…

50
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,935
Strike!

51
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,103
Excuse me…

52
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,613
<i>Huh?</i>

53
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,740
<i>Who's this stone-faced guy with the afro?</i>

54
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,826
<i>He looks kind of familiar.</i>

55
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,203
{\an8}<i>Oh, right. He's in my guild.</i>

56
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,371
{\an8}<i>His name is…</i>

57
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,498
<i>Yamada.</i>

58
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:53,127
AKANE: GOOD MORNING, YAMADA-KUN

59
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,057
YAMADA: HI

60
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:09,727
AKANE: ARE YOU HUNTING TOO?

61
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,988
YAMADA: YEAH

62
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,159
<i>I remember him now.</i>

63
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,495
<i>He's so expressionless,</i>
<i>it left a bad impression on me.</i>

64
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,748
<i>And why did it take him two minutes</i>

65
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,583
<i>just to type "hi" and "yeah."</i>

66
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,920
YAMADA: YOU'RE NOT AIMING FOR
THE PROPHET'S STONE, ARE YOU?

67
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,005
{\an8}AKANE: WHAT'S THAT?

68
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:43,761
{\an8}YAMADA: IT'S A RARE ITEM LEFT
BY 0.1% OF EVERY 22 MOBS

69
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,556
<i>He seems like one of those</i>
<i>addict types too.</i>

70
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,932
<i>"No, not that."</i>

71
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,392
No, not that.

72
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:52,728
My boyfriend dumped me yesterday,

73
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,438
so I was taking out my frustration.

74
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,106
Oh, and get this!

75
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,735
He was cheating on me
because of this game.

76
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,403
What a jerk!

77
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:05,324
{\an8}TWO MINUTES LATER

78
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,493
{\an8}Oh, is that so?

79
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,036
{\an8}YAMADA: OH, THAT SO?

80
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,704
{\an8}IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING FOR RARE ITEMS,

81
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,332
{\an8}CAN YOU LET ME USE THE HUNTING GROUND?

82
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:16,585
<i>Zero desire to converse with me, huh?</i>

83
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,088
Absolutely not!

84
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,757
<i>I found this hunting ground first,</i>

85
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,134
<i>so the proper thing</i>
<i>is to refrain until I'm finished.</i>

86
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,595
<i>I was told that's</i>
<i>proper hunting-ground etiquette.</i>

87
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,971
<i>I'm sure you're uninterested,</i>

88
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,474
<i>but I'm suffering from a broken heart.</i>

89
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,852
This hunting ground shall be
my stress reliever.

90
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:36,605
<i>Please look for the Prophet's Stone</i>
<i>on another channel.</i>

91
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,441
<i>I shall not permit</i>
<i>anyone else to use this space!</i>

92
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,485
I SHALL NOT PERMIT ANYONE ELSE
TO USE THIS SPACE!

93
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:45,823
<i>Oh no!</i>

94
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:46,865
<i>I lost my cool</i>

95
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:49,243
<i>and took out my frustration</i>
<i>on an afro-haired stranger.</i>

96
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,121
Well, I guess…

97
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:53,997
you're right…

98
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:58,377
I CAN'T SAY I'M INTERESTED.

99
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,545
<i>I hate you, Yamada!</i>

100
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,922
<i>I'm gonna stay online until you leave!</i>

101
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,883
<i>This is why I hate gamer guys!</i>

102
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:11,682
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY EVENT

103
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,058
<i>An event?</i>

104
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:17,896
<i>Attendees will receive avatars</i>
<i>or other special prizes.</i>

105
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,273
<i>The location is nearby.</i>

106
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:27,865
<i>Akane!</i>

107
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,700
<i>Let's stay together, forever!</i>

108
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:32,494
<i>Right!</i>

109
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,335
<i>Sorry…</i>

110
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,921
<i>While playing that game, I…</i>

111
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:45,007
<i>fell in love with someone else.</i>

112
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:53,348
<i>They said they're in love with me too.</i>

113
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,060
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

114
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,938
<i>I'm sure…</i>

115
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:02,316
<i>he's already dating her.</i>

116
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,196
<i>Does that mean…</i>

117
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,406
<i>they'll go to the event, together?</i>

118
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,827
<i>Damn it!</i>

119
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,581
<i>He can't just dump me</i>
<i>and get away unscathed!</i>

120
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:21,793
Akane!

121
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,962
You finally came to class!

122
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:25,464
Over it, already?

123
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,174
Momo…

124
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,259
Hey, Momo…

125
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,678
Help me shop
for a new outfit and shoes today.

126
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:33,597
Are you going somewhere?

127
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,059
Yeah, I decided to attend an event.

128
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,436
And at that event,

129
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,064
that creep will be there too.

130
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:46,026
Let him cry bitter tears
when he sees how beautiful I've become.

131
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,779
You're not over it at all!

132
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,449
Please tell me it's not an event
for that online game.

133
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:53,909
No can do!

134
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,203
Of course it's for that game.

135
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,455
There's a high chance he'll be there.

136
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,831
That's pretty cringe.

137
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,960
Say what you like.

138
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,336
Incredible…

139
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,339
<i>-He'll rue the day.</i>
-Please make me look cute!

140
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,591
<i>-That he ever left me.</i>
-Please make me look thin!

141
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,593
<i>-For that gaming tramp.</i>
-Of course!

142
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,929
<i>I'll make him regret it!</i>

143
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:20,769
<i>Thank you for attending today's</i>
<i>Forest of Savior Autumn Event!</i>

144
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,438
<i>The PIN number you received</i>
<i>at the entrance</i>

145
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:26,024
<i>is valid until the end of December.</i>

146
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:29,152
{\an8}<i>This is a pretty big event…</i>

147
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,447
<i>There are way more people than I expected.</i>

148
00:09:34,116 --> 00:09:35,158
<i>Huh?</i>

149
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:36,994
<i>Wait a minute…</i>

150
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,663
<i>Did I just blow my entire monthly budget?</i>

151
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,790
<i>In any case,</i>

152
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:45,711
<i>everyone here is playing</i>
<i>the same online game, huh?</i>

153
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,130
<i>There sure are a lot of guys.</i>

154
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,674
<i>It's pretty mysterious…</i>

155
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,218
<i>I wonder what their characters are like?</i>

156
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,303
Takuma!

157
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:59,057
<i>Taku…ma…?</i>

158
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,605
-Ta--
-Let's get closer to the stage.

159
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,647
Sure.

160
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,526
W… wait!

161
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,409
What happened?

162
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,745
<i>That hurt!</i>

163
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,913
That girl tripped.

164
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:26,710
<i>I'm such a moron.</i>

165
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,129
<i>I wish I could disappear.</i>

166
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,673
<i>At this rate…</i>

167
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,634
<i>I'm gonna cry!</i>

168
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,264
Are you okay?

169
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,316
<i>Whoa, a hottie!</i>

170
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,568
Yes! I'm fine!

171
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,029
Did I bump into you, by any chance?

172
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:54,946
Yes.

173
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,408
I'm so sorry! I was drifting off,
or better put,

174
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:00,243
I had something on my mind, and…

175
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,996
I'm going through a rough patch

176
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,082
and I've lost sight of what's around me.

177
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:07,751
Oh.

178
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,795
That so?

179
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,800
Sorry. You don't care, do you?

180
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:15,884
Um…

181
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,469
Well…

182
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,721
I can't say I'm interested.

183
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:24,726
<i>Huh? That line…</i>

184
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,645
<i>I've heard it somewhere, recently.</i>

185
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,689
I CAN'T SAY I'M INTERESTED.

186
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,693
Yamada?

187
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,697
Yamada with the afro?

188
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,453
Who are you?

189
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,167
Who are you?

190
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,795
Um…

191
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,214
I, uh…

192
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,091
<i>Huh?</i>

193
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,218
<i>Not much of a reaction.</i>

194
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,138
<i>But then, I'm sure I felt déjà vu.</i>

195
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,681
<i>Is it my imagination?</i>

196
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,266
<i>Is it too big of a coincidence?</i>

197
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,519
<i>Uh-oh, he's looking at me</i>
<i>with really creeped-out eyes now.</i>

198
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:10,313
<i>Is he the wrong guy?!</i>

199
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,606
Please forgive me…

200
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,821
<i>Takuma… and his new girlfriend?</i>

201
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,282
What are you doing here?

202
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,577
Oh, Takuma! What a coincidence!

203
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,745
You're Yamada, aren't you?!

204
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,165
You're Yamada, right?

205
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,209
Who's he?

206
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,169
Don't you know?

207
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,963
He's a super-famous pro gamer.

208
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:35,881
Wow!

209
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,382
Wow is right!

210
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:39,259
Does this mean you play FOS, Mr. Yamada?

211
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,011
I'm a huge fan of yours!

212
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,013
I watch all your videos.

213
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,973
This is such a thrill!

214
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,850
Oh, man!

215
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,644
You're famous?

216
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,646
Well, in small circles.

217
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,151
Fancy that, Takuma!

218
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,403
Are you on a date too?

219
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:00,739
Oh, it's Akane.

220
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:01,656
You're here too?

221
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,033
I've been here the whole time!

222
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,455
What are you doing at a place like this?

223
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,373
I play the game too.

224
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,209
Is it so surprising that I'm here?

225
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,629
Don't tell me you came alone?

226
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,797
Of course not.

227
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,174
Let me introduce you

228
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,550
to my new boyfriend!

229
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,551
Not true.

230
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,263
Please…

231
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:29,059
Take pity on this lowly peasant
and play along.

232
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,769
Are you crazy?

233
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,480
Consider it an act of charity.

234
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,483
I'll give you this.

235
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,443
I got it as a present for attending.

236
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,111
If you like…

237
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,739
Seriously?

238
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,492
That's the PIN code
for the Prophet's Stone.

239
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,453
It's an extremely rare power-up stone.

240
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,664
<i>It is?</i>

241
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:52,999
I'm her boyfriend.

242
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,042
He's my boyfriend!

243
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,462
Y… you can't be serious.

244
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,006
I've been following him for three years

245
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,509
and haven't even gotten one response.

246
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,718
DESPITE COMMENTING ON ALL HIS POSTS…

247
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,428
I'm humiliated!

248
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,721
Takuma!

249
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,474
-So humiliated…
<i>-I win!</i>

250
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,060
<i>It's not what I imagined, but…</i>

251
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:14,229
<i>-He's humiliated.</i>
-So humiliated…

252
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,859
Takuma, cheer up!

253
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,903
Eri!

254
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,780
Takuma!

255
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,824
Eri!

256
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,326
Takuma!

257
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,371
IZAKAYA BOTTA

258
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:32,956
Welcome!

259
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,628
How can I put it…?

260
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,714
This feeling…

261
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:45,427
It's like I won the battle
but lost the war.

262
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,929
Can you really say you won the battle?

263
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:48,847
From what I saw…

264
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,143
You're definitely Yamada with the afro.

265
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,938
Well… By the way, can I go?

266
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,398
<i>He's definitely Yamada.</i>

267
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:00,775
Come on! Just keep me company!

268
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:02,611
I don't wanna be alone right now!

269
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,112
Ugh…

270
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,493
That girl…

271
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,914
She was really pretty.

272
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,041
Who was?

273
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,084
Takuma's girlfriend.

274
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:19,669
For starters, who's Takuma?

275
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,546
My ex-boyfriend!

276
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,798
I told you everything in the game chat!

277
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:29,512
You're that wimpy looking paladin?

278
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,222
You only figured it out now?

279
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,434
It's impressive
that I figured it out at all.

280
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,395
Welcome!

281
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,899
In truth, today…

282
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,610
I wanted him to see me dolled up

283
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:45,612
and make him regret dumping me.

284
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:48,907
<i>I never wanted</i>

285
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:51,785
<i>to see them together like that.</i>

286
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:00,835
Um…

287
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,589
This could take a while.

288
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,132
Can I refill my cola?

289
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:07,217
As much as you want.

290
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,969
Our pleasure!

291
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:12,263
<i>I'm feeling less tense, somehow.</i>

292
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,933
That reminds me, what's a pro gamer?

293
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,851
Takuma mentioned it…

294
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:20,689
I suppose it's anyone who gets money
from a sponsor for playing a game.

295
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,649
A sponsor?

296
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:23,692
No way!

297
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,859
It's true.

298
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:27,487
{\an8}Do you get paid to play FOS too?

299
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,656
{\an8}That's just for relaxation.

300
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,449
{\an8}I mainly play FPS.

301
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:34,661
{\an8}What's that?

302
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,496
{\an8}Uh, never mind.

303
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,123
{\an8}FPS MEANS FIRST-PERSON SHOOTER

304
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,379
Aren't you being a bit cold?

305
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,756
You won't get many girls that way.

306
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,591
I don't.

307
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,010
I've never had a girlfriend.

308
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,512
You can't be serious.

309
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:55,890
Didn't you just say I won't get girls?

310
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,392
Yeah, I did, but…

311
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:00,186
A hot guy like you must have girls
crawling over him.

312
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,021
IS THIS MODESTY?!

313
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,981
I can't say I'm interested.

314
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,775
I don't get romance and all that.

315
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:10,947
What a waste of a hot guy.

316
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:12,782
I have more fun gaming.

317
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,409
SUCH A WASTE…

318
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,998
Well, romance isn't
all wine and roses, anyway.

319
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,126
Some people get cheated on
through a video game, like me.

320
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,252
Sounds miserable.

321
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,380
<i>Miserable…</i>

322
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,761
<i>Oh no, here come the tears.</i>

323
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,222
I need to use the restroom.

324
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,779
<i>My clothes are a mess.</i>

325
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,656
<i>I must have dirtied them when I fell.</i>

326
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,034
<i>Ow…!</i>

327
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:59,913
<i>I scraped my foot too.</i>

328
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:00,747
IT'S BLEEDING…

329
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,751
CRISP LEMON SOURS

330
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,007
<i>I never should have</i>
<i>gone to such a stupid event.</i>

331
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,511
<i>Not if it makes me feel like this.</i>

332
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:23,686
<i>Huh?</i>

333
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,773
<i>He…</i>

334
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,733
<i>Don't tell me he went home?</i>

335
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:30,902
<i>Well, it figures.</i>

336
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,279
{\an8}<i>He looked like he could bolt</i>
<i>at any moment.</i>

337
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,197
{\an8}LET ME OUTTA HERE!

338
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,574
<i>Not that it matters…</i>

339
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,744
<i>I was forcing him</i>
<i>to keep me company, after all.</i>

340
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,455
<i>I guess</i>

341
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,958
<i>I'd better get used to being alone.</i>

342
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,089
Are you okay?

343
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,680
What's with that face?

344
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:03,017
Y…Yama… Ya… Maya…

345
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,105
Anyway, mind sitting down?

346
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:16,739
What's that?

347
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,366
A bandage.

348
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,618
I went out for about ten seconds
to buy one.

349
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:24,831
Crap, it's stuck.

350
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,500
I'm gonna put it on now.

351
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,554
You went to buy that for me?

352
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:43,057
The blood was hard to ignore.

353
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,560
And so you took the time?

354
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,687
I guess.

355
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,732
I had about three colas too.

356
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,697
Yamada!

357
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,781
IZAKAYA BOTTA

358
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,742
Keep ordering whatever you like!

359
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,202
No, it's about time I--

360
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,745
We're getting drunk tonight!

361
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:04,829
Wait, um…

362
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,748
I'd like to make an order, please!

363
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,082
Our pleasure!

364
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,096
<i>Anyway, Tani's watching the perimeter.</i>

365
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:30,730
<i>We can concentrate on the frontlines.</i>

366
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,986
<i>We might wrack up a lot of kills.</i>

367
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,990
{\an8}<i>My head is killing me…</i>

368
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,118
<i>Especially on the next map.</i>

369
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,998
<i>And why do I keep hearing someone's voice?</i>

370
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,293
<i>I told you, I'm not turning the camera on.</i>

371
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:55,922
<i>Who's there?</i>

372
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,342
Quit pestering me.

373
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,147
Sorry, I have to step away.

374
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:14,857
I'll be right back.

375
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,539
{\an8}VERY PIGTAILEY, YAMATO NADESICO,
SAMURAI, TWISTY PONYTAIL

376
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,919
Yup, there are no cute free haircuts.

377
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,672
{\an8}Then again, all the cute ones are Gacha.

378
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:02,590
{\an8}WILD FLOWERS GACHA
MOONLIT NIGHT GACHA

379
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,884
{\an8}I'll never win one of those.

380
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,803
{\an8}EDGE OF THE LAKE GACHA
STARRY TOWER GACHA

381
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,099
{\an8}Some of them are discounted.

382
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,683
{\an8}They're not as good as the Gacha,

383
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,352
{\an8}but they're cuter than the default.

384
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:15,311
{\an8}SHORT WITH BUN, VIRGIN
TWIN-TAILS, CURLY GIRL, SEAWEED HELMET

385
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,521
I see…

386
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,897
Get the discounted ones

387
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,441
to add some individuality on a budget.

388
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:26,072
I bought the cutest
discount style they had!

389
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,749
We all had the same idea.

390
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,919
