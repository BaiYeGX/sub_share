00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,633
<i>Just after 2 a.m.…</i>

2
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:11,846
<i>in my room where I live alone…</i>

3
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:16,434
COOLING PADS

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,563
<i>sits a high-school boy</i>
<i>I met through gaming…</i>

5
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:29,405
<i>and myself</i>
<i>with a 37.8-degrees-Celsius fever.</i>

ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

7
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,049
I was fast asleep last night.

8
00:02:12,133 --> 00:02:14,218
I'm sorry I didn't notice your call.

9
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,304
{\an8}Will this be enough to survive for a week?

10
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,476
Momo, you're a goddess.

11
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,436
Really though, Akane…

12
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,689
Whenever you get a fever,
it always escalates.

13
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,690
YOU NEED TO EXERCISE MORE…

14
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,983
You've got no stamina at all.

15
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,276
-TAKE OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO CHILL
-OKAY

16
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:33,028
-Did you see a doctor?
-Uh, yeah.

17
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:36,115
Yamada took me to a hospital
with a night-time clinic.

18
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,992
I plan to go again tomorrow.

19
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,369
OH, NICE… SHE BOUGHT MEAT TOO!

20
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,370
Huh?

21
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:43,205
Oh, right.

22
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,958
-Yamada came to check on me yesterday.
-He what…?!

23
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,628
You didn't start dating
without telling me?

24
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,964
Of course not! We're just friends.

25
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:53,591
He really is a nice guy.

26
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:57,845
Hold it… that sounds like…

27
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:01,265
<i>Never mind. I'll wait until she's better.</i>

28
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,349
DISPLAY OF COMPASSION

29
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,769
That's all for now.

30
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,022
I'll be heading home then.

31
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,358
Thank you! I'll get
some money, so wait here.

32
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:15,321
<i>Is there really a man</i>

33
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:18,449
<i>who'd go that far</i>
<i>for a woman he doesn't like?</i>

34
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,992
<i>I doubt it,</i>

35
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:23,162
<i>but I don't know anything</i>
<i>about Yamada's personality</i>

36
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,122
<i>and Akane seems to have set herself</i>

37
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,125
<i>high hurdles for love since her break up.</i>

38
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,877
I UNDERSTAND HOW SHE FEELS THOUGH

39
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,087
{\an8}I ADDED A LITTLE EXTRA

40
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,005
{\an8}THANKS

41
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,423
Okay, I'm off.

42
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,593
Akane, if anything comes up,
tell me right away.

43
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:45,851
Oh, and timing is everything
when it comes to romance.

44
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,896
Huh? Oh, yeah.

45
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:49,897
Right.

46
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,941
As long as you understand.

47
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:52,983
Bye!

48
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,793
TEXT FROM AKITO YAMADA

49
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:14,004
THANKS FOR TODAY. FEELING OKAY?

50
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:15,047
SORRY, JUST SAW THIS. I'M FINE.

51
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,425
WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

52
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,929
<i>I have to make it up to him</i>
<i>when I'm better.</i>

53
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,681
<i>What would he like?</i>

54
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,850
{\an8}MESSAGE HISTORY: AKITO YAMADA,
MOMOKO MAEDA, AYU, PRINCESS RURI, MOM

55
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,652
Is your cold okay?

56
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,988
I can log in this weekend.

57
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,323
Let's game together when you're better!

58
00:04:41,407 --> 00:04:42,241
-I MISS YOU!
-AWW…

59
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,951
<i>Runa!</i>

60
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:48,205
<i>Now that you mention it,</i>
<i>I wonder if Runa logged in yesterday.</i>

61
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:51,667
<i>I was supposed to join her</i>
<i>in saying hello to the new member.</i>

62
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,670
<i>I haven't even met her yet.</i>

63
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:57,298
<i>I'm tired from studying,</i>

64
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,590
<i>maybe I'll play FOS for a while.</i>

65
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,429
<i>I doubt Runa or Yamada are online,</i>

66
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,056
<i>but maybe Princess Ruri</i>
<i>and Mr. Kamota are.</i>

67
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,891
<i>I'd love to go hunting together!</i>

68
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,769
SYSTEM: AKANE HAS LOGGED IN

69
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,480
<i>I haven't raised my level recently.</i>

70
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,649
<i>I want to make up for lost time!</i>

71
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,401
Oh, it's Akane!

72
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,533
Oh, it's the new member I've heard about!

73
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,453
This is our new member, Tsubaki!

74
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,164
Nice to meet you! I'm Akane!

75
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:32,333
I'm a level 55 paladin!

76
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,085
I'm Tsubaki. Nice to meet you.

77
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,463
I've only just started playing.

78
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:41,967
I was just talking with Tsubaki
about exploring the map.

79
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,887
But since you're here, Akane,
why don't we all go hunting?

80
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,096
Sounds great!

81
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:47,598
Huh?

82
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,642
I'm still learning how to fight.

83
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,102
I'd just be a burden to you.

84
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,687
Since you're a paladin,

85
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,856
you should learn from Akane!

86
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:58,442
You're a paladin too, Tsubaki?

87
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:00,861
Are most people mages?

88
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:05,991
Everyone around here is a mage
with demon-like fire power.

89
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,911
Plus, they all have
higher defense than me.

90
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,412
Sometimes, I wonder

91
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,957
why I chose this class in the first place.

92
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:17,628
I mean, the game says Paladins
are the recommended class for beginners.

93
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,754
That may be,

94
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,965
but I believe paladins are powerful
when they reach high levels.

95
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,509
They're the only class

96
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,803
that can challenge
end game bosses on their own.

97
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,679
Sounds fun.

98
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,098
I like a good challenge.

99
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,350
I GUESS EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT APPROACH

100
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,518
<i>Wow! She's great!</i>

101
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:35,354
Even so, I've heard the combat
system is difficult--

102
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,271
Don't worry!

103
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,107
Leave it to me!

104
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,900
<i>I'd better set a good example.</i>

105
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:43,737
<i>I'd better not get in their way.</i>

106
00:06:44,238 --> 00:06:45,364
Mom!

107
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,658
My donuts are missing!

108
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:50,536
Well then, shall we depart?

109
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,538
Have you looked over your equipment?

110
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,497
Yes.

111
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,790
Yes.

112
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,924
What a beautiful blue sky!

113
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:09,430
Princess Ruri loves the graphics
for the sky in this game!

114
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,933
It might be my favorite part of FOS.

115
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,769
What do you two think?

116
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:20,441
I'm a little busy right now!

117
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,444
{\an8}-Strike!
-Shield!

118
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,326
Um, rather than admiring the scenery,
how about helping us out?

119
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,953
This monster is really tough!

120
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,206
If Ruri attacks, it'll be an instant kill.

121
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,626
This isn't one of the tougher bosses.
Just do your best!

122
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,627
You can't be serious.

123
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:42,045
It has so much HP,

124
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,214
there are four bars!

125
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,257
{\an8}ORDINARY ENEMY

126
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,219
DAMAGE METER

127
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,847
The damage you inflict

128
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,975
is less than the monster's natural
healing ability. It's so funny!

129
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,977
{\an8}PRINCESS RURI'S HATRED
FROM PALADINS INCREASES 2X!

130
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,104
Watch out, here it comes.

131
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:00,856
Darn it!

132
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,357
-Strike!
<i>-But then…</i>

133
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,860
Strike!

134
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,445
{\an8}NATURAL HEALING POWERS

135
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:07,988
{\an8}<i>It's true.</i>

136
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,491
<i>At this rate, attacks are useless.</i>

137
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,701
Thanks to the Guild Master's
healing magic,

138
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,244
we won't die, but…

139
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:19,833
{\an8}TSUBAKI
AKANE

140
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,628
{\an8}Our HP drains fast!

141
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:25,339
If you use a little strategy,

142
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,383
the two of you should be
more than capable of defeating it.

143
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,220
Oh, I think I understand!

144
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,889
We may need to mash our skill buttons!

145
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,098
{\an8}IS THAT WHAT SHE MEANT BY STRATEGY?

146
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:37,518
{\an8}I've already been pushing them repeatedly.

147
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:38,936
Let's try it.

148
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,395
We'll mash to our deaths.

149
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,022
One, two, three…

150
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:47,027
{\an8}MASH

151
00:08:48,612 --> 00:08:50,739
THE MASTER SENSES SOMETHING

152
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:52,282
SINCE THE CHAT HAS GONE QUIET

153
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,537
GROAN

154
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,415
They must be really mashing their buttons.

155
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,876
Would you like a hint?

156
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,919
Wait!

157
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,797
-I think I've figured it out.
-For real?

158
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,591
Maybe… don't say anything yet.

159
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,093
Sure thing!

160
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,303
HINT, PLEASE!

161
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:21,770
{\an8}AFTER WHAT FELT LIKE 500 MILLION YEARS

162
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,036
My fingers are numb.

163
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,580
Mine too.

164
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:41,498
But in the second half,

165
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,458
we got its HP down pretty low, right?

166
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:47,379
It was almost as if there was a specific
time when attacks were effective.

167
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:48,505
Right!

168
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,965
When it spread its wings!

169
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:54,636
Maybe we need to inflict damage
efficiently in those moments.

170
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,597
Which means we save our mashing for then!

171
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,100
Do you mind if we check
each other's skills?

172
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,227
Sure! Let's look over our equipment too.

173
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,230
<i>They're friends already.</i>

174
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,901
TSUBAKI: MY ARMOR IS RUINED.
I'M GONNA TAKE A BREAK.

175
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:11,153
AKANE: I'M GOING TO LOG OFF! BYE!

176
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,904
PRINCESS RURI: OKAY! THANKS! GOOD WORK!

177
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,656
PRINCESS RURI: I'LL REPAIR
YOUR ARMOR, TSUBAKI.

178
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,408
TSUBAKI: THANK YOU, AKANE.

179
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,493
TSUBAKI: TAKING MY ARMOR OFF NOW.

180
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,167
{\an8}<i>Her name's Akane and she's in my guild.</i>

181
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,795
{\an8}<i>Which means she's probably the one.</i>

182
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,132
AKANE HAS SENT YOU A FRIEND REQUEST

183
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,678
<i>She was pretty easy to talk to.</i>

184
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,597
{\an8}ARE YOU AWAKE?

185
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,640
{\an8}YES.

186
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:45,145
AKANE CALLING

187
00:10:47,606 --> 00:10:48,649
Hello?

188
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:51,526
Yeah.

189
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:53,987
Huh?

190
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,697
The Evil Dimitar?

191
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:57,407
What is this about?

192
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,785
{\an8}The monster you encounter in the field,

193
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,828
{\an8}right after leaving the FOS starter town.

194
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,081
The one with four bars of HP.

195
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:06,875
You mean a randomly appearing boss?

196
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,001
<i>Yeah, like that!</i>

197
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,003
<i>Princess Ruri said the same thing.</i>

198
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:11,797
<i>Have you ever defeated it?</i>

199
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,302
I haven't fought many bosses of that rank.

200
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,096
<i>I see…</i>

201
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,681
<i>I was wondering if there was</i>
<i>a secret to beating it.</i>

202
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:22,849
Well…

203
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,601
If it has a gimmick,

204
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,686
you should adjust your maneuvers to that.

205
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,729
THE EVIL DIMITAR

206
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:29,731
A gimmick?

207
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,401
<i>Like moments when attacks</i>
<i>are ineffective or something.</i>

208
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,444
<i>There are many patterns.</i>

209
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,321
Right! Yeah, that happened!

210
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:39,116
What should I do in those moments?

211
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,411
{\an8}Buff?

212
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,829
{\an8}Oh, I see!

213
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,332
So, do you like our guild?

214
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,667
{\an8}USING WEAVING SKILL TO FIX ARMOR

215
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,129
{\an8}Akane's easy to talk to, right?

216
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,839
Uh, yeah.

217
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:55,715
Everyone's been nice.

218
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:57,676
I'm quite relieved.

219
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,095
To the point that I feel guilty.

220
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,597
Why's that?

221
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,517
In the past…

222
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,145
I wasn't really interested in this game.

223
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:13,942
You could say I joined your guild
for more selfish reasons.

224
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,945
And yet, now…

225
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:21,366
I'm no longer sure what it was
that I even wanted to do.

226
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,619
Are you all right? If you have a problem,
Ruri's happy to listen!

227
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,418
TSUBAKI: THERE'S NOTHING

228
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:33,128
TSUBAKI: TO TALK ABOUT.

229
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,633
<i>I've merely been watching. That's all.</i>

230
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,637
<i>I've done nothing more</i>

231
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:44,598
<i>than watch in fear.</i>

232
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,559
There's nothing to it.

233
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:52,230
I just don't have the courage to act.

234
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:53,690
{\an8}THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT?

235
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,401
{\an8}SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO ACT?

236
00:12:56,485 --> 00:13:00,113
Umm… I'm not sure what this is about,

237
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:03,033
but what if you try acting first?

238
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,452
If there's something you want to do,

239
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:07,829
couldn't you just give it a try?

240
00:13:07,913 --> 00:13:11,583
If you wait for courage or motivation,
you could wait forever!

241
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,585
Sometimes, you have to act first!

242
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:16,087
If there's something you want to change…

243
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:22,761
And then…

244
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,596
Oh no, look at the time.

245
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,390
Sorry, I've been rambling on and on.

246
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,518
-You must be tired.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

247
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,853
<i>My hand got so numb,</i>
<i>I switched to Bluetooth.</i>

248
00:13:31,937 --> 00:13:33,730
<i>Honest as always, huh?</i>

249
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,816
In the end, what was it
that you wanted to ask?

250
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,859
<i>Oh…</i>

251
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:41,196
Well, it's more like…

252
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,616
{\an8}<i>I wanted to hear your voice.</i>

253
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,494
That's all. Bye!

254
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,085
AKANE
CALL TERMINATED

255
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,005
<i>M… My hands…</i>

256
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,716
<i>are shaking.</i>

257
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:10,559
Momo?

258
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,269
Thanks for earlier.

259
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:13,979
Is this a good time?

260
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,023
Well, you see…

261
00:14:17,691 --> 00:14:21,444
There's something
I want to talk about, after all.

262
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,116
MOMO: HERE'S A CAFE I WANT TO GO TO

263
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,284
CAN WE TALK THERE?

264
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,952
-TOMORROW AT 11.
-OKAY

265
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,295
<i>Here, huh?</i>

266
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:40,922
CUTE PLACE

267
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,716
<i>I never noticed this place.</i>

268
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:51,850
Anyway…

269
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:54,603
what I wanted to talk about
on the phone was…

270
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:57,898
Why…?

271
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:00,358
Why do you think he dumped me?

272
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,406
Your order, please.

273
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,618
I'd like souffle pancakes and an iced tea.

274
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,829
-She'll be fine with water.
-You're awful!

275
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:16,499
SOUFFLE PANCAKES

276
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,251
Same as her, please!

277
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,296
Pancakes and iced tea,
two items for each of you.

278
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:26,426
Akane, I'm disappointed in you.

279
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:27,802
But why?!

280
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,387
<i>There's something I want to talk about.</i>

281
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,306
For real?! Oh, but wait!

282
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,599
I want to talk in person!

283
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,100
Somewhere we can sit down!

284
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,018
FINALLY!

285
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:39,648
<i>While I waited a whole week</i>
<i>for your cold to mend,</i>

286
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,483
<i>I could barely contain myself</i>

287
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,861
{\an8}<i>and I only went on three blind dates.</i>

288
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:46,821
{\an8}<i>And yet, when I finally</i>
<i>get to hear you out,</i>

289
00:15:46,905 --> 00:15:50,825
<i>the idiocy of your conversation starter</i>
<i>exceeded my wildest imagination.</i>

290
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:51,910
<i>Such a disappointment.</i>

291
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,955
<i>Three times in a week</i>
<i>sounds like a lot to me.</i>

292
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:58,750
And here I thought I'd be treated
to some fun romantic talk!

293
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,127
Let me finish, okay?

294
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,840
These days, I wonder about something.

295
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:08,510
And I mean this

296
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,679
in terms of my love life…

297
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,431
In order for me to move forward,

298
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:17,852
if there's something
majorly wrong with me, I want to fix it.

299
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,105
It could be that I'm just unaware.

300
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,273
Maybe I have some terrible habits!

301
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,483
Where did you get that idea?

302
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,445
When I think it's possible that I have
some fatal flaw

303
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,365
that will ruin any romantic relationship
I try, I get so scared--

304
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:31,866
There's nothing.

305
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:34,911
If I'd known I would
worry like this later,

306
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,579
should I have abandoned my pride

307
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,874
and asked Takuma the reason?

308
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,127
Um, I don't think--

309
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,378
NOT A GOOD IDEA…

310
00:16:43,461 --> 00:16:44,921
Welcome!

311
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,757
What's this?

312
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,883
Um, excuse me, gentlemen--

313
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,761
I thought I saw someone cute,
and it turns out to be Momo!

314
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:54,764
What a coincidence!

315
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,307
-Excuse me…
-Wh… Who's he?

316
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,435
-A guy from a blind date.
-We're fine!

317
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,770
-Um, sir…
-He couldn't keep his hands to himself…

318
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,772
-I really--
-And I left right away.

319
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,734
Just who is setting up
these blind dates for you?

320
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,111
Friends of friends of friends…

321
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:09,988
Mind if I sit here?

322
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,282
No way!

323
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,117
And hello to your lovely friend.

324
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,369
-What'll you have?
-I'm really sorry.

325
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,787
I'll take care of this,

326
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,122
so just ignore them!

327
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,792
Aren't you being a bit pushy?

328
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:24,419
Momo is clearly bothered.

329
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,089
Right? We're such a nuisance, us two.

330
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,382
Say, Momo!

331
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,259
You fled without paying, didn't you?

332
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,804
I gave my money to the organizer.

333
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,015
Oh? That's not what I heard.

334
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,434
Did you ask her directly?

335
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,811
Who cares? It was a few drinks.

336
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,022
Let's try and get along.

337
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,400
<i>At this rate, they're not gonna leave.</i>

338
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:49,694
Say Momo, you sure smell nice!

339
00:17:49,778 --> 00:17:52,447
-No way! Too close!
-Excuse me!

340
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,157
Sorry to keep you waiting.

341
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,703
Here are your souffle pancakes
and ice tea.

342
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,918
Wait… Was this a table of four?

343
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,088
-Eita!
-Sasaki! Actually, that table…

344
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,592
Oh my.

345
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,053
We know each other, so…

346
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,138
Don't worry about it!

347
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,058
EITA! HELP!

348
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,726
{\an8}A GUILD MEMBER'S PLEADING EYES

349
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,854
Excuse me, sir. I apologize,

350
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,565
but I can't allow you to trouble
our other customers.

351
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:30,401
I'll happily guide you to another table.

352
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,153
We're fine here.

353
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,535
I apologize,

354
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,121
but I can't allow you to trouble
our other customers.

355
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,373
Please move to another table.

356
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,461
-I told you, we're--
-Your cooperation is appreciated.

357
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,385
Oh, Eita! Thanks!

358
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,511
What a coincidence!

359
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,139
You startled me!
I didn't notice it was you.

360
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:01,516
I noticed you though.

361
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,767
Say something then!

362
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:04,144
It was more fun staying quiet.

363
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:05,478
<i>They know each other?</i>

364
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:06,980
Excuse me…

365
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,649
I'm sorry for causing trouble
for your establishment.

366
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:12,861
Not at all.

367
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,032
Man, what a surprise!

368
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,785
Thank god Eita was here, huh?

369
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:22,912
That is one hot guy.

370
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:27,542
-Eita's in my FOS guild too.
-Oh my!

371
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,377
Seriously? Him too?!

372
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,754
Yeah! He's the Guild Master.

373
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,642
{\an8}That game you play offers
better dreams than blind dates, huh?

374
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:47,145
{\an8}I'm starting to feel like a fool.

375
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,813
{\an8}I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

376
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,198
Momo…

377
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:00,325
Back to what we were talking about…

378
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:07,081
Good work, today.

379
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,791
You too!

380
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,877
Oh, hey Sasaki! Got a moment?

381
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,462
Huh? Afraid not.

382
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,256
Why, you ask?
Because I'm done for the day.

383
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,091
It's not about work!

384
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:20,428
All of us on the afternoon shift
are going to karaoke later.

385
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,554
Want to come?

386
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,848
Since you helped me out, it's my treat.

387
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,936
My little sister
is waiting for me. No can do!

388
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:29,020
Sister complex!

389
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:29,938
How rude!

390
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,649
I just happen to love her too much.

391
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,691
So, a sister complex.

392
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,235
You even admit it!

393
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,028
Bye now!

394
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:44,369
Hey, Eita!

395
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:48,331
Huh? You two are still here?

396
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,249
What are you doing?

397
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,334
There's nothing in this area.

398
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,211
We were waiting for you, Eita!

399
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,129
Oh my! Waiting for Ruri?

400
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:56,839
<i>That's his personality?!</i>

401
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,309
There's something I want to tell you.

402
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,435
Do you have time?

403
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:47,075
Shall we go then?

404
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,202
Have you looked over your equipment?

405
00:22:49,285 --> 00:22:50,870
-Yes.
-Yes!

406
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,206
<i>I'd better set a good example.</i>

407
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,627
<i>Equipment…</i>

408
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:03,633
{\an8}SEARCHING INVENTORY

409
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:06,677
Wait a minute,

410
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:09,472
isn't your equipment a bit
different from mine, Tsubaki?

411
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,773
How cool! Are those rare items?

412
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,525
Uh, not exactly…

413
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:21,776
SHE GOT THEM EASILY ON THE MAIN QUEST

414
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:24,570
Come on! Tell me how you found them!

415
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,155
I didn't "find them" or anything.

416
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,783
-On my first quest, I--
-Yeah? Go on!

417
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,994
<i>On the contrary, players like Akane</i>
<i>who've maxed out</i>

418
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,956
<i>their default equipment are super rare.</i>

419
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,416
I'M JEALOUS

420
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,459
