00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:07,425
<i>Runa from the House of Sasaki</i>

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,677
<i>was raised by an overprotective mother,</i>

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,679
<i>a kind father,</i>

4
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:13,723
<i>and an older brother</i>

5
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:16,684
<i>who did everything for her in advance.</i>

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:20,104
<i>She was the butterfly,</i>
<i>the flower, of the family.</i>

7
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:23,774
<i>She was especially fond</i>

8
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:27,153
<i>of the chocolate donuts made</i>
<i>by the neighborhood donut shop,</i>

9
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,822
<i>online video games,</i>

10
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:33,576
<i>and her friendly gaming companions.</i>

11
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,538
<i>But as for unfamiliar places,</i>

12
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,206
<i>unfamiliar things,</i>

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,083
<i>and unfamiliar people…</i>

14
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:46,130
<i>she hates those.</i>

15
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:59,935
ORIGINAL STORY BY MASHIRO

16
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:23,435
<i>Spoiled from birth,</i>
<i>Runa of the House of Sasaki</i>

17
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,354
<i>believes that if she waits quietly,</i>

18
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,899
<i>someone will give her attention.</i>

19
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,192
SILENCE

20
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,319
<i>The other girls in class</i>

21
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,530
<i>find her difficult to handle.</i>

22
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,573
THAT GIRL IS KIND OF HARD TO APPROACH

23
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:39,243
<i>At one time, the older girls bullied her…</i>

24
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,703
THOSE RIBBONS ARE HUGE.
WHO DOES SHE THINK SHE IS?

25
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:44,582
{\an8}<i>But Runa has 300 friends online</i>

26
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,791
{\an8}<i>so paid it no mind.</i>

27
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:46,709
{\an8}-RUNA, ARE YOU OKAY?
-JUST IGNORE THEM

28
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,128
<i>Even when a girl in the same class</i>

29
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,171
<i>for all three years of junior high…</i>

30
00:02:51,255 --> 00:02:53,841
Sasaki, you have class duty today, right?

31
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,260
Shouldn't you erase the board?

32
00:02:57,136 --> 00:02:57,970
Oh, right.

33
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:01,098
<i>…still calls her by her last name,</i>

34
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,809
<i>Runa pays it no mind.</i>

35
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,606
<i>On top of that,</i>
<i>Runa of the House of Sasaki</i>

36
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,609
<i>has always been very pretty,</i>

37
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,613
<i>and many boys have harbored</i>
<i>secret crushes on her.</i>

38
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:19,783
<i>But on school trips, when they catch sight</i>

39
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,286
<i>of her frilly Lolita-style street clothes,</i>

40
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,122
<i>they can't help but compare her</i>
<i>to other girls</i>

41
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,708
<i>and stop short of talking to her.</i>

42
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:28,959
SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT ABOUT HER.

43
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:32,087
<i>In addition, Runa's older brother</i>
<i>is quite handsome,</i>

44
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,631
<i>and an older friend from childhood</i>

45
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,258
<i>is even more handsome.</i>

46
00:03:36,342 --> 00:03:39,845
<i>With these two as her standard,</i>

47
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:43,182
<i>the boys in her class</i>
<i>all appear to her like this.</i>

48
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:46,852
Hey, look!

49
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,395
We made a new video.

50
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:50,481
That's so cute!

51
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,024
I did it with Yuka.

52
00:03:52,107 --> 00:03:53,359
Will you dance for me too?

53
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,276
Sure.

54
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,820
First, you go like this…

55
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,282
Are you serious?

56
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,162
{\an8}-GIRLS IN MY CLASS DID A FUNNY DANCE
-BUT I'LL BET YOU DIDN'T JOIN THEM

57
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:06,789
{\an8}-RUNA HAS PROBLEMS COMMUNICATING
-JUST ASK THEM TO LET YOU JOIN IN!

58
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,795
Oh no, I'll be late!

59
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:15,089
A-chan, Mako-rin, bye-bye!

60
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,423
Mi-chan, bye-bye!

61
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,552
You too, Sasaki. Bye-bye!

62
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:21,804
Have fun!

63
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,097
Of course!

64
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,141
<i>Runa of the House of Sasaki…</i>

65
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,564
<i>…always gets her way at home</i>

66
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,400
<i>but outside, she's very much a coward.</i>

67
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:41,699
Coming!

68
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,827
<i>But these days, Runa…</i>

69
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,414
Hi there, Runa!

70
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,917
<i>Has gained an older female friend.</i>

71
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,171
I bought the new pudding variety
from the convenience store.

72
00:04:56,255 --> 00:05:00,217
<i>Akane is a bit more adult</i>
<i>than the girls in her class.</i>

73
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:01,844
Akane!

74
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,305
I saw a funny dance today at school.

75
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:06,098
Oh yeah? Show me.

76
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,934
<i>Even if Runa is mean or selfish,</i>

77
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,894
<i>Akane remains kind,</i>

78
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,397
<i>and Runa has the slightest feeling</i>

79
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,525
<i>that it's not a friendship of equals.</i>

80
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:19,778
Oh, and that's not all--

81
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,780
Hang on a second.

82
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,282
A friend is texting me.

83
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:24,199
HUH? WHAT IS IT?

84
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,284
<i>Even so,</i>

85
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,911
<i>Akane is not family or a childhood friend,</i>

86
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:31,290
<i>so things don't go exactly</i>
<i>as she would like.</i>

87
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,001
<i>Another friend?</i>

88
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,627
<i>Why can't she reply later?</i>

89
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,046
<i>I'm with her right now.</i>

90
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,881
<i>When Runa's mood darkens,</i>

91
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,800
<i>Akane doesn't go</i>
<i>out of her way to cheer her up.</i>

92
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,219
<i>Actually, she doesn't even notice.</i>

93
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,096
Hey, Runa! Look!

94
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,098
They're shooting a drama near the station

95
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,851
and that actor Sato is there!
Let's go see him!

96
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,354
Akane, your tastes are pretty trendy.

97
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,148
That's right. They are.

98
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,191
AND BUYS THE LATEST PRODUCTS

99
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,108
<i>However…</i>

100
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,777
Hurry!

101
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,570
Wait for me!

102
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,155
<i>The new thrills she experiences</i>

103
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,114
<i>differ from</i>

104
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,200
<i>her brother's friends.</i>

105
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:09,369
<i>Even though Runa supposedly hates</i>

106
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,914
<i>new people and new things.</i>

107
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:20,339
Sato was pretty hot from afar too.

108
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:21,882
You think?

109
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:24,635
Isn't Yamada more handsome?

110
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,803
Yeah, but…

111
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,263
Yamada is Yamada.

112
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,264
You have a point.

113
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,892
Hey, look! Over there!

114
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,102
They're dancing!

115
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:34,812
It looks fun!

116
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,732
I don't get people
who dance in the street.

117
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,776
Why don't we join in

118
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,278
with that funny dance you showed me?

119
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,279
Absolutely not!

120
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,864
Was it like this?

121
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,616
No, like this!

122
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,828
<i>Still, these days…</i>

123
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,288
<i>she's started to feel</i>

124
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:57,918
<i>that having more friends</i>
<i>to do funny dances with</i>

125
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,212
<i>might be nice.</i>

126
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:07,386
I need a good romance.

127
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,932
My life plan calls for marriage

128
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,311
around the time I graduate college.

129
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,398
My mom had me at 20 years old.

130
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:23,694
I always thought I'd do it
while I am young as possible.

131
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,115
But for that, I need a husband first.

132
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:31,702
And to get a husband,
I need a boyfriend first.

133
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,539
So I need romance--

134
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:36,832
Wait,

135
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,959
let the attacker make the final blow.

136
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:40,544
Yeah, just a bit more.

137
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,172
I did it! Quest cleared!

138
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:46,467
Don't tell me
neither of you were listening?

139
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,469
Oh, sorry.

140
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:51,346
Look, Momo! I reached level 50 in a week.

141
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,556
Who cares?!

142
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,183
If you do as I tell you,

143
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,560
you'll max out
before the end of the month.

144
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:58,562
Akane…

145
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,522
You're spending a free afternoon

146
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,941
playing games with
a runaway middle school student.

147
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,401
Are you okay?

148
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,944
She's not a runaway!

149
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:08,238
She's just having a cold war
with her older brother

150
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,157
and doesn't want to be at home.

151
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,117
That's no reason that the two of us

152
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,828
should have to play around with a child.

153
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:17,664
If you're so bored, why don't you go home?

154
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,958
You had no reason to come anyway.

155
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,335
Silence!

156
00:08:22,586 --> 00:08:24,087
Don't test me, little girl.

157
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,175
I envy you, Akane.

158
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,928
Meeting a hot younger guy by chance…

159
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,429
You mean Yamada?

160
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,306
You've got the wrong idea.

161
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,892
Oh, but we have gotten a little closer.

162
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,477
He added me to his friend list.

163
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,394
{\an8}ADD YOU AS A FRIEND? SURE.

164
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,104
{\an8}Though he's as expressionless as ever

165
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,857
and won't go hunting with me.

166
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,360
The gap in levels is too big.

167
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,487
There's no incentive for him.

168
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,324
But if I ask, he tells me
all about different equipment.

169
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,868
He's surprisingly kind.

170
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:59,540
Surprisingly? He's always been kind.

171
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,416
He still tutors me,

172
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,502
even though he's studying
for entrance exams.

173
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,296
Huh? Then he must be popular with girls.

174
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,257
Super popular.

175
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,883
I guess he isn't into girls.

176
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,052
I've never seen him with a girlfriend.

177
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,887
Huh? What a waste!

178
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:16,265
Maybe I can change his mind.

179
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,559
Speak of the devil…

180
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:19,476
SYSTEM: YAMADA HAS LOGGED IN

181
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,229
Hey there, Yamada!

182
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,235
Hi.

183
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,572
I haven't seen you online for a while.

184
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:32,739
I guess.

185
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,408
I've been busy lately.

186
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,492
Oh, that's right!

187
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,828
I tried the method you taught me

188
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,538
and buffed my footwear.

189
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,834
I THINK YOU USED THE WRONG MATERIAL.

190
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,588
Huh? I needed to use the INT jewel, right?

191
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:50,340
{\an8}I copied what you did.

192
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,759
{\an8}I'm a wizard, so I need INT.

193
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,845
{\an8}But a Paladin needs VIT more.

194
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,347
{\an8}You mean I used the wrong jewel?

195
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,557
999 FRAGMENTS FORM ONE JEWEL…

196
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,976
{\an8}I worked hard to gather the fragments.

197
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:03,061
{\an8}Would you like to use my backup footwear?

198
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,064
{\an8}I have some with max shielding power.

199
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,448
No, it's fine.

200
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:16,450
I just need to form a VIT jewel, right?

201
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,828
I'll go hunting again
until I get enough fragments.

202
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:22,456
I know where my effort is needed now.

203
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,879
Right…

204
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,840
Sorry, I was out of line.

205
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,593
Please do your best.

206
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,264
A smiley face?!

207
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,807
How rare…

208
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,601
<i>She's shouting to herself.</i>

209
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,353
<i>Has she finally gone nuts?</i>

210
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,771
<i>Sounds like she's having fun.</i>

211
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,442
This is so boring!

212
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,444
All you do is play online games!

213
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:54,738
I wanna go out! I want a blind date!

214
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,787
Why don't you try it too, Momo?

215
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,872
It's actually quite fun.

216
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,749
I'm allergic to that stuff.

217
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,709
Don't be like that.

218
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:10,837
I don't know anything about computers!

219
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,423
Get used to it, and it's a piece of cake.

220
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,635
I'm about to go hunting,

221
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:17,761
so why don't you watch?

222
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,066
Um, I don't know much about computers,

223
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,860
but I imagine smoke is a bad sign.

224
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:39,908
Akane's PC broke?

225
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:40,826
Yeah.

226
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,995
It blew up while she was playing online.

227
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,165
FOS has gotten more demanding
since the last update.

228
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,419
Maybe it was too much for her hardware.

229
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,048
She can't play
until she gets money for a new one.

230
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,633
{\an8}She was really sad.

231
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,051
{\an8}NO EYE CONTACT DUE TO COLD WAR

232
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:00,303
HMM…

233
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,805
JOB WANTED ADS

234
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,479
Coming!

235
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:11,815
Who's there?

236
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,532
Hi.

237
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,912
I brought a repairman.

238
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:27,414
See?

239
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,477
EITA SASAKI CALLING

240
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:56,985

241

EITA SASAKI CALLING

242
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,962
-Yeah?
<i>-Good morning, Yamada-kun!</i>

243
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,007
{\an8}Hi…

244
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,968
What is it?

245
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,763
<i>Do you happen to have a used computer?</i>

246
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:26,640
<i>An older model perhaps.</i>

247
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,099
Nope.

248
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:31,311
<i>It seems Akane's PC broke.</i>

249
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,024
<i>They say smoke came out.</i>

250
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,819
Smoke? From where?

251
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,239
<i>I haven't seen it, so who knows.</i>

252
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,367
<i>When you have time,</i>

253
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,286
<i>would you mind taking a look for her?</i>

254
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,371
Me?

255
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:52,999
<i>You might be able</i>
<i>to fix it with spare parts.</i>

256
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,418
Shouldn't you do it?

257
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,128
<i>I could do it,</i>

258
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,673
<i>but it'd be bad</i>
<i>if I made a mistake, right?</i>

259
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,843
<i>Plus, a virile young man entering the</i>
<i>apartment of a cute female college student</i>

260
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,595
<i>sounds kind of dangerous.</i>

261
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,889
What the heck am I, then?

262
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,307
<i>A new species.</i>

263
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,229
<i>Runa said she was really sad.</i>

264
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,398
<i>Akane has been trying</i>
<i>really hard at FOS lately.</i>

265
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,358
<i>I feel bad for her.</i>

266
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,778
<i>Why not stop by after tutoring Runa?</i>

267
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:26,449
<i>I'll have Runa show you</i>
<i>the way to her apartment. Okay?</i>

268
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,701
<i>Please.</i>

269
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,582
<i>No, it's fine.</i>

270
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,543
<i>I just need to get the VIT jewel, right?</i>

271
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:39,087
<i>I'll go hunting again</i>
<i>until I get enough fragments.</i>

272
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,849
<i>You came to repair my computer, Yamada?</i>

273
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,103
That's right! I brought him!

274
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,356
I just came to have a look.
Don't expect too much.

275
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,357
Runa brought him!

276
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:01,610
Don't look at me like that.

277
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,362
-I don't know if I can fix it.
-Runa--

278
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:05,697
BROKEN

279
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,365
A laptop, huh?

280
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,659
Make yourselves at home.

281
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:11,578
Would you like some snacks?

282
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,996
-No need.
-Please!

283
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,498
{\an8}<i>Yamada's a good guy.</i>

{\an8}HIGH QUALITY RICE CRACKERS

285
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,251
{\an8}Hey, Akane!

286
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,669
Yeah?

287
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,881
Um, over there in that room…

288
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,674
The "you know what"…

289
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:25,884
Is it okay?

290
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,477
{\an8}<i>Thank god. He didn't notice.</i>

291
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,146
{\an8}<i>Well, it's Yamada. Maybe he's immune.</i>

292
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,942
<i>It feels a little strange for Yamada</i>
<i>to be in my apartment,</i>

293
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,777
<i>but then Runa said…</i>

294
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,028
<i>Yamada's not into girls.</i>

295
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,781
<i>If I make too big a deal,</i>

296
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,241
<i>it'll be uncomfortable for him.</i>

297
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:52,243
<i>Just act normal!</i>

298
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,996
Have you two eaten lunch?

299
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,749
If not, I'll fix up something simple.

300
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,459
I want some!

301
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,628
What about you, Yamada?

302
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,383
Thanks, I'll have some.

303
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,842
<i>Oh, how rare.</i>

304
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:08,885
ASSUMED HE WASN'T HUNGRY

305
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:10,136
It's fine.

306
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,223
I'm a bit late in saying this, but…

307
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,265
Yeah?

308
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,352
The curry you made

309
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,396
was really good.

310
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,482
Sorry, I only remembered now, so I forgot

311
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,025
to bring the containers.

312
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,612
I'm glad!

313
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,824
I'll make something special,

314
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:32,033
so eat all you want.

315
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,456
Oh, about the guild…

316
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,542
A new girl joined.

317
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,921
She's really open-hearted and cute.

318
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:46,756
<i>Princess Ruri!</i>

319
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,218
{\an8}<i>I got yelled at by someone</i>
<i>in the dungeon again.</i>

320
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,137
{\an8}<i>People shouldn't abuse newbies!</i>

321
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,056
{\an8}You could say her feelings are clear

322
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,309
{\an8}or that she doesn't hide them.

323
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:00,854
I happen to think

324
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:04,691
a straightforward girl like that
would be perfect for you, Akito.

325
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,860
I won't accept some stranger!

326
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,195
You sound like a nosy sister-in-law.

327
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:19,664
<i>Not interested.</i>

328
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,710
Your adapter plug has melted.

329
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:24,961
A DAPPER BOAR?!

330
00:17:26,129 --> 00:17:28,173
When did you buy this PC?

331
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:31,468
It was when I entered college, so…

332
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:36,973
TEXT FROM RUNA

333
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,725
ALL GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN

334
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,728
{\an8}JUST FOR FUN

335
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,979
Be still my heart!

336
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,982
{\an8}LOOKS GOOD, BUT THERE'S STILL DISTANCE.

337
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,859
HELP THEM GET OVER THE HURDLE

338
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,614
HELP THEM?

339
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,116
I PERSONALLY ENJOY A GOOD ROM-COM

340
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,870
<i>Romantic comedies… you mean…</i>

341
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,122
WALKING IN DURING BATH,
ACCIDENTAL FEEL,

342
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:02,665
LATE TO SCHOOL WITH TOAST IN MOUTH

343
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,375
<i>Like that?</i>

344
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,297
You haven't ever cleaned
your keyboard have you?

345
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,299
Does it need that?

346
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,803
-I think I see a stain.
-No, don't look!

347
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,691
Another beautiful day.

348
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,617
Akane!

349
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,621
What's up? I'm almost finished.

350
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:42,914
Um…

351
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,667
Are you planning to take a bath?

352
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:47,669
Not really.

353
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,214
I'm cooking now. I'll take a bath tonight.

354
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,304
Yamada, will you take a bath?

355
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,639
No.

356
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,269
<i>Who knows what she's thinking?</i>
<i>Let's not ask.</i>

357
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,355
Akane, can I have a slice of bread!

358
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:08,273
Go ahead!

359
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,485
If you eat now,
will you have room for more?

360
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,445
I'm making a rice omelet, you know.

361
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,990
Don't worry. It's not for me.

362
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,451
NOT SURE HOW TO REACT

363
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:22,954
GOT IT IN HER MOUTH,

364
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,248
BUT NO LONGER SURE SHE HAS THE RIGHT GENRE

365
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,295
{\an8}Why did you eat it?!

366
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,754
{\an8}Why did you feed it to me?

367
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,464
Darn it, come over here!

368
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,091
-Hey, wait!
-You need to get closer.

369
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,178
-Don't push me!
-So this can work out!

370
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,262
What are you…

371
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,180
talking about?

372
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,434
That hurt…

373
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,855
Huh? What comes next?

374
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:53,359
-Stop this behavior at once--
-Ow…

375
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,612
Yamada? Are you okay?

376
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,572
Your hair hit my eye.

377
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,115
Really? Oh, I'm sorry.

378
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,201
Are you okay? Is it stuck in your eye?

379
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,244
That hurt…

380
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,662
Show me!

381
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,750
Which eye was it?

382
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,929
I'm…

383
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,180
fine.

384
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:29,729
<i>Oh no, I panicked</i>
<i>and got right in his face.</i>

385
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,773
<i>Maybe it bothered him?!</i>

386
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,192
I'm so sorry, Yamada!

387
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,902
You apologize too, Runa!

388
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,697
I'm so… sorry!

389
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,033
I'll tie my hair up, okay?

390
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,409
-Um…
-Yes?

391
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,996
I need some things from home.

392
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,042
I didn't bring any tools with me.

393
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,126
Oh, but…

394
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,628
I'll be right back.

395
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,213
You mean there and back?

396
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,548
-I don't want to take up--
-It's fine.

397
00:20:57,632 --> 00:20:58,633
I live close by.

398
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:11,604
It was like he was running away.

399
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,982
You thought so too?

400
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,820
<i>It must have really bothered him.</i>

401
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:22,198
<i>He really is uncomfortable around girls.</i>

402
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,994
<i>I've done something awful.</i>

403
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:04,467
<i>Women with a light volume of hair</i>

404
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,928
<i>can tie it back</i>

405
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:10,932
{\an8}<i>even with a pin like this.</i>

406
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:14,310
<i>Women with a heavy volume of hair…</i>

407
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,272
RUNA: HEAVY VOLUME, THICK TEXTURE

408
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,816
<i>…end up like this.</i>

409
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,151
{\an8}<i>For women with heavy volume,</i>

410
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,778
{\an8}<i>even a ponytail is tough.</i>

411
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,196
{\an8}MY ARM HURTS
I'VE HAD ENOUGH

412
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,783
{\an8}I'm jealous of your thin hair.

413
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,785
{\an8}Isn't it better to have more?

414
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,453
{\an8}Definitely not.

415
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,833
<i>Young girls have all sorts of worries.</i>

416
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,961
