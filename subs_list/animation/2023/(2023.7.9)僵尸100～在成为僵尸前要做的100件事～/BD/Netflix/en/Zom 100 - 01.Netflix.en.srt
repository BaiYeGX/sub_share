1
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,185
Stay away! Stay away!

2
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:19,978
No!

3
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,443
Stop! Stop!

4
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,041
I can't take this anymore!

5
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:46,838
This is a living hell!

6
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:53,929
<i>Someone!</i>

7
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,389
<i>Someone!</i>

8
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:58,684
<i>Anyone!</i>

9
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,437
{\an8}<i>Anyone… Save me… from this hell!</i>

10
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,273
{\an8}Well…

11
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,902
Compared to the office,
that would be heaven.

12
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,951
{\an8}Oh, no…

13
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,205
I need to sleep, since tomorrow's…

14
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,337
Tomorrow…

15
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:30,549
I got work again

16
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,051
tomorrow?

17
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:37,973
Work…

18
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,731
I don't wanna go…

19
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,817
<i>It happened three years ago.</i>

20
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,735
Here.

21
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:55,032
Starting today, you're assigned
to the Production Department…

22
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,241
All right.

23
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:02,789
My name is Akira Tendo.
Nice to meet you all!

24
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,000
-Nice to meet you!
-Welcome aboard.

25
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,044
<i>On my first day, I got the impression</i>

26
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,504
<i>that it was a lively company</i>
<i>with a great atmosphere.</i>

27
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,257
Yes! I'm happy to be here!

28
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,553
<i>I landed a job in a production company</i>
<i>and industry I'd dreamed about.</i>

29
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:20,015
<i>I was full of hopes, dreams, and ambition.</i>

30
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,518
<i>I'm gonna pump out commercials</i>
<i>for all the big players!</i>

31
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,272
<i>Which means</i>
<i>maybe I'll even meet some stars!</i>

32
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,275
<i>Wow… I'm gonna do my best.</i>

33
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,193
All right…

34
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,986
You'll be sitting here.

35
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,904
Yes, sir!

36
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:37,324
If there's anything you don't understand,
ask Kosugi, the Department Chief.

37
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,492
Nice to meet you!

38
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,243
Yes! I look forward to working with you!

39
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,120
Thank you for your hard work, sir.

40
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,249
I'm sorry!

41
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,584
It's all right.

42
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,795
I wasn't looking where I was going…

43
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,964
No! It's my…

44
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,186
Excuse me!

45
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,104
Here!

46
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,355
Thank you.

47
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,314
Sure…

48
00:03:09,398 --> 00:03:12,818
Nice to meet you.
I'm Saori Ohtori from Accounting.

49
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,028
Looking forward
to working with you, Tendo.

50
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,449
Same… here.

51
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:24,663
For invoices or if you have any questions,
come ask me anytime.

52
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,499
I sit right through there and to the left.

53
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,959
Got it.

54
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:32,295
Well, good luck on your first day!

55
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,176
<i>She's so cute…</i>

56
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,554
TORIYA

57
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,140
Cheers!

58
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,183
-Thanks for all your hard work!
-Bottoms up!

59
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,893
Tendo, where did you go to school?

60
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:47,811
K University!

61
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,855
Wow, that's a good school!

62
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,273
It's not really…

63
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,232
Got a girlfriend?

64
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,443
No, I haven't had any luck…

65
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,028
What? A stud like you? What a shame!

66
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,031
No… I'm not…

67
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:02,743
You can ditch the tie,
we're not that kind of office.

68
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,286
Thank you.

69
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,705
But this gets me pumped up.

70
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,624
You look athletic, did you play anything?

71
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,627
Yes! I played rugby throughout college.

72
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,756
Rugby?

73
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,048
-That's great!
-Yeah!

74
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,676
Looks like we got a dependable
and valuable asset on our team!

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,761
I'll say!

76
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:38,695
<i>Wow. Miss Ohtori's cute, for sure!</i>

77
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,198
<i>She's totally my type!</i>

78
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,743
<i>All right!</i>

79
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,288
<i>I'll work hard and show results</i>
<i>to make a good impression on her!</i>

80
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,793
About time we got going, right?

81
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:53,752
Yeah.

82
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,379
Thank you very much for today.

83
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:57,714
I'm looking forward to--

84
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,799
All right.

85
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,385
Let's get back to the office.

86
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,642
{\an8}KOSUGI
TAKAHASHI

87
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,565
<i>What's going on?</i>

88
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,067
<i>What is this?</i>

89
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,486
<i>This can't be normal, right?</i>

90
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,321
How much longer till you finish?

91
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,615
-About…
-Ten minutes, okay?

92
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,326
<i>An all-nighter on my first day…</i>

93
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,786
<i>The next morning…</i>

94
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,579
<i>Still in the office.</i>

95
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,289
Good morning!

96
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,541
Morning.

97
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,793
<i>And that evening…</i>

98
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,294
{\an8}SOLD OUT

99
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,547
<i>I mean, seriously…</i>

100
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,466
<i>When can I go home?</i>

101
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,802
I'm going out to buy dinner.

102
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:48,056
<i>It doesn't look like</i>
<i>I'll be going home tonight, after all!</i>

103
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,435
<i>Ultimately, I wasn't able</i>
<i>to leave the office and go home</i>

104
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,312
<i>until two days later.</i>

105
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,288
<i>This must be one of those</i>

106
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,457
<i>exploitative corporations.</i>

107
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,554
<i>I'm still sleep-deprived.</i>

108
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:33,268
<i>How long will I be</i>
<i>away from home this time?</i>

109
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:42,611
<i>All of a sudden,</i>
<i>I don't want to go to work.</i>

110
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,119
<i>Why am I whining?</i>

111
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:53,038
<i>This is nothing! Get used to it!</i>

112
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,124
<i>I chose this career!</i>

113
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,126
<i>I worked hard to get it!</i>

114
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,878
<i>Suck it up! Show some backbone!</i>

115
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,839
<i>Don't underestimate us jocks!</i>

116
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,383
Good morning!

117
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,511
<i>Our company has</i>
<i>many employee-friendly policies.</i>

118
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:09,429
TENDO

119
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,513
Yes, well…

120
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,807
Annual paid vacations, naturally.

121
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,144
But you also get your anniversary day off,
and mental health days.

122
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:19,022
Never seen anyone use them, though.

123
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:23,777
<i>We encourage each other</i>
<i>with good-natured competition.</i>

124
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,029
How much unpaid overtime
did you log last month?

125
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,530
One hundred and fifty hours.

126
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,283
Talk to me once you pass 200.

127
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,286
<i>I'm blessed with kind co-workers.</i>

128
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,580
I'll cover dinner.

129
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,749
I might not look it,
but it's my fifth year.

130
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,668
I make more than you.

131
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,669
Thank you…

132
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,922
<i>He just treated me, but Mr. Takahashi's</i>
<i>take home pay is 210,000 yen.</i>

133
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,091
<i>Mr. Kosugi, our team leader…</i>

134
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,260
Quit asking me each and every time!

135
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,180
Why can't you decide
on something like that yourself?!

136
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,766
What?! You made a decision without me?!

137
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,060
Don't go off on your own!

138
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,019
<i>He can be moody.</i>

139
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:58,937
Get out of here!

140
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:04,651
<i>But he's so passionate about mentoring</i>
<i>that some employees are moved to tears.</i>

141
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,821
Where do you think you're going, damn it?!

142
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,408
{\an8}<i>Everyone at the office</i>
<i>is very health conscious.</i>

143
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,744
Talk to me when you start pissing blood.

144
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,163
Another day, another ulcer.

145
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:19,207
<i>And then, in my second year…</i>

146
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:28,925
TRASH

147
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,847
<i>When was the last time I took a bath?</i>

148
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,099
<i>Tonight, I'll go home no matter what.</i>

149
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,017
Tendo!

150
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,019
Yes?

151
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,855
Takahashi's out. So you take over.

152
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,315
It's due by the end of the week.

153
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,233
TAKAHASHI

154
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,736
Yes, sir.

155
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,945
{\an8}YAMAKAWA - TAKAHASHI - SAKAI

156
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,238
{\an8}<i>Another all-nighter confirmed.</i>

157
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:54,242
Damn it, useless crap, honestly…

158
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:59,039
<i>Maybe a missile</i>
<i>will come falling down on me…</i>

159
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:01,583
Here, Tendo!

160
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:05,545
You worked through lunch again,
didn't you?

161
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,964
You have to eat.

162
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,507
Miss Ohtori!

163
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,593
Thank you very much!

164
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,389
<i>The one person keeping me sane</i>
<i>at this company…</i>

165
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,060
<i>Miss Ohtori, the one</i>
<i>I'd secretly had a crush on…</i>

166
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,063
-Thank you--
-Ohtori, got a minute?

167
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:24,814
Yes!

168
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,649
See you, Tendo!

169
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,568
Hang in there.

170
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,403
<i>Miss Ohtori was also…</i>

171
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,619
Sir, not here…

172
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:42,082
-It's okay! The walls are thick.
-Sir!

173
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,167
<i>…the CEO's mistress.</i>

174

No… Sir…

176
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:58,723
<i>Why am I still working there?</i>

177
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,018
<i>Should I find another job?</i>

178
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,270
<i>No… Impossible.</i>

179
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,606
<i>Where would I find the time?</i>

180
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,946
<i>If I leave, the team</i>

182
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,622
<i>Oh, well…</i>

183
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,165

184
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,337

187
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:42,016
<i>the managing director promised his</i>

188

189

191
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,694
Fine, then!

192
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,654
There are plenty of other companies
that would…

193
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,198
No, I'm sorry! I'll have it by today.

194

-Yes.

195
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,160

-Yes.

196
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,202
<i>Please do that…</i>

197
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,162
Yes…

198
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:06,499

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,459

200
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,670
Why the hell are you slacking off?!

201
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,214
Is this harassment? Is that what this is?!

202
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,133
Are you harassing your superior?!

203
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:19,429
Quit messing with me!
You idiotic piece of…

204
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,897

206
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:38,072

I don't wanna go to work!

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

232
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,846
Damn it, I'm gonna be late for work.

233
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,101
Excuse me.

234
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,186
It's about my parking fee.

235
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm sorry it's late…

00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,801

<i>I mean, those are zombies, right?</i>

243
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,084
<i>What do I do?</i>

244
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:37,877
<i>What do I do?!</i>

245
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:39,921
<i>I mean, if this keeps up</i>

246
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,839
<i>I'm gonna be late for work!</i>

247
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,020

248
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,899
<i>So…</i>

249
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,443
<i>Could this…</i>

250
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,489
<i>Does this mean…</i>

251
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,700
<i>Starting today,</i>

252
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,578
<i>I don't have to go to work anymore?</i>

253

I'm…

254
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:24,507
…free!

255
00:15:57,373 --> 00:16:02,879
<i>Until yesterday, I saw the world</i>

256
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,089
<i>Blue skies!</i>

257

<i>It's been so long…</i>

260
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:16,267
<i>I'd forgotten the world</i>
<i>was so full of color!</i>

261
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,979
I'm just so happy

262
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,275
to have a day off from work!

263
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,995
Now then, what to do today?

264
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:41,626
I was gonna get my motorcycle license
when I had some time off.

265
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,628
I could go to Yakushima.

266
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,922
Or go skydiving…

267
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,968
Or I could start day drinking
and binge movies all day!

268
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,931
I've had a ton a things I've wanted to do!

269
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,058
And now I can do them all, starting today!

270
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:12,365
<i>I wonder if Miss Ohtori's all right.</i>

271
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,872
Who cares if she's someone's side chick?

272
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,794
I'd rather get eaten by zombies
than regret holding in these feelings…

273
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,174
…I've had for the past three years!

274
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:47,984
Miss Ohtori, wait for me!

SAORI OHTORI

276
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,389
This is it!

277
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,896
Damn it, I'm starting to get cold feet!

278
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,232
Is it creepy if a coworker
you've never hung out with

279
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,984
suddenly shows up at your house?

280
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,360
Yeah, it's definitely creepy.

281
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,324
No! This is just a safety check
during an emergency!

282
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,006
<i>It's open?</i>

283
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,844
Miss Ohtori?

284
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,512
I came to check if you're…

285
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,272
Boss…

286
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,028
Sir!

287
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,530
I have something important to tell you.

288
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,783
Do you have a minute?

289
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,995
The long, hard hours at work
have been overwhelming,

290
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,206
and it's made me forget
what living like a human is.

291
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,168
I don't even know why I'm working anymore.

292
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:33,297
Anyway, it pains me to say this,

293
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,759
but it's time I regain control
over my life.

294
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,304
So, I've made up my mind
to resign as of today!

295
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:44,308
I know I was inexperienced in many ways,
but you mentored me until today.

296
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,770
For that, I'm very grateful.

297
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,648
I know this is selfish of me…

298
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,694
But please, accept my resignation!

299
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:58,030
Thank you very much!

300
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,992
<i>-A comeback try!</i>

301
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,843
Miss Ohtori!

302
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,342
From the moment

303
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,345
I saw you on my first day at work…

304
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,348
I've always…

305
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,018
Always, always…

306
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:19,445

309
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,436
That hits the spot.

310
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,527
Tomorrow, the day after, next week…

311
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,572
I don't have to go to work ever again.
It's like a dream.

312
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,123
<i>We could die today…</i>

313
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,962
<i>Or we could die 60 years from now…</i>

314
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:23,634
