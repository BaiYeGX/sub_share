Are you all right?

You've really hung in there…

10

There's nothing to be afraid of here.

11
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:29,488

There's a small meeting I need to attend.

18
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,098
It'll be all right.

19
00:00:58,642 --> 00:00:59,851
I'll definitely come back.

Don't do it, Akemi! Stop--

00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,641
Damn it.

00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,647

just lay down and die!

00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,965

I can grow any kind of beard I want.

00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:55,355
<i>I can only use my phone now</i>
<i>because internet traffic is down.</i>

56
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,820

would just lay down and die.

just happened to pick the bondage room.

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,360

00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:12,742
Is this how this all ends for me?

75
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,871

76
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,671
Hey, that's wild!

77
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:32,470
<i>-Why am I thinking of him now?</i>
-My sides hurt!

78
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,266
<i>Oh… that's right…</i>

79
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:41,479
<i>You always laughed</i>
<i>at my stupid jokes, didn't you?</i>

80
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,818
-Do it again! I want to film it!

00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,385
What's wrong?

88
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,095
You sound down!

89
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,141
Uh, well… why do you sound so hyped?

90
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,686
<i>I'll tell you all about it when we meet!</i>

91
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,313
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

92
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,106
I'm in Shinjuku.

00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,984
<i>Okay! Shinjuku! I'll be right over!</i>

94
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,861
No, it's impossible.

95
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:33,198
<i>The place is swarming with zombies.</i>
<i>Just forget about me!</i>

96
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,116
<i>It'll be fine! It'll be fine!</i>

97
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,368
<i>Anyway, text me your address!</i>

98
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,828
-Huh? You--
<i>-Bye!</i>

99
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,921
<i>Back in college, Kencho and I</i>
<i>went through a lot together</i>

100
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,006
<i>during our four years in the rugby club.</i>

101
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,467
<i>He was a handsome, smooth talker.</i>

102
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,222
<i>But despite being popular, he'd go</i>
<i>all-out to be the life of the party.</i>

103
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,892
<i>He was my closest friend.</i>

104
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:07,398
<i>He became a big-time</i>
<i>real estate agent after college.</i>

105
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,110
<i>With his natural talent for communication,</i>

106
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,612
<i>things were smooth sailing</i>
<i>for him at his job.</i>

107
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:16,116
Yesterday, I was entertaining
some Diet members!

108
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,369
Those guys spend money
on a whole other level!

109
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,329
Oh, that's right.

110
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,331
Check out my new girlfriend.

111
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,751
She's a model!

112
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,505
-Took a day trip to Paris last weekend.
<i>-Meanwhile…</i>

113
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:34,759
<i>My soul was getting crushed in the gears</i>
<i>of an exploitative corporation.</i>

114
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,889
<i>So I didn't have the patience to listen</i>
<i>to other people's success stories.</i>

115
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,020
What's the deal with your company?!

116
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:47,480
It's super exploitative!

117
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:49,190
Just walk away!

118
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,734
You should just quit already!

119
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,158
What the hell…

120
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,536
I'm seriously struggling, here.

121
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,914
My serious advice is that you should quit!

122
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:07,667
Staying with a company
like that is stupid.

123
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,877
You're just an idiot!

124
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:14,007
And you're being obnoxious with all
your bragging about your personal life!

125
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,550
You should stop doing that!

126
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,222
Bartender!

127
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:22,432
Check please!

128
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,064
Wait for me, Kencho!

129
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,025
I'm on my way!

130
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,502
So, this is the end, huh?

131
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,466
Considering my life…

132
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,302
It's a pretty great way to go out.

133
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:02,680
I'm sorry

134
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,017
I couldn't keep my promise.

135
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,785
What happened?

136
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,748
Am I… safe?

137
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,338
What's that noise?

138
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:57,527
All right!

139
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,282
Okay!

140
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,583
What's happening?

141
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,754
The zombies are gone?

142
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,090
What's going on here?

143
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:50,496
Kencho…

144
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,045
Akira…

145
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,509
You really came.

146
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:04,761
Kencho!

147
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,939
You were right this whole time!

148
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,068
I should have just quit
a company like that!

149
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:24,238
But instead of listening to your advice…

150
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:29,160
I got jealous of how successful
and happy you were.

151
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,497
I got annoyed
and took my anger out on you!

152
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,335
Even though we're friends… I'm sorry!

153
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:41,255
I really am! I'm sorry!

154
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:49,180
You… came all this way

155
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,807
just to tell me that?

156
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:55,144
I'm really sorry!

157
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,813
Well…

158
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,981
How should I say this?

159
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,151
I should…

160
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,280
They're back!

161
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,907
I shouldn't have shouted!

162
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,951
Our only chance is to go up!

163
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,207
Kencho! Behind you!

164
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,711
It's no good! It's not gonna hold!

165
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,213
Hang in there!

166
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,139
That won't be enough.

167
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,349
They'll get through soon!

168
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,019
<i>What should we do?</i>

169
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,313
<i>What should we do?</i>

170
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:40,982
<i>What should we do?</i>

171
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,483
<i>What should we do?</i>

172
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,734
<i>What should we do?</i>

173
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,155
Ugh, damn it!

174
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,906
What should we do, Akira?!

175
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,159
Hey, Akira!

176
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,872
We jump.

177
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,463
The next building over
is close enough to leap across.

178
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,506
What? No way…

179
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,300
We can't make that distance!

180
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,843
That's impossible!

181
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,680
Hey… Akira?

182
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:17,351
Guess we'll find out by jumping!

183
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,397
Akira!

184
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,703
Are you all right?!

185
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,625
How'd you like that?!

186
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,627
How'd I like it?!

187
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,171
You've got balls of steel, man!

188
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,465
Hurry up and get over here!

189
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,021
Kencho?

190
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:06,984
Akira…

191
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,780
I know you came all this way
to save me, but I'm sorry.

192
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,412
I don't think… I can jump that.

193
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:25,211
Before the end, there's something
I want to tell you, Akira.

194
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:28,548
The truth is…

195
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:34,554
I didn't enjoy my job at all.

196
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:41,269
Day after day, I had to smile at people
while lying to their faces.

197
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,147
I tricked them into bad contracts.

198
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:51,153
The praise from the higher-ups,
the company's acknowledgement…

199
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,448
The gorgeous models I dated…

200
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,828
Dining out with big-time politicians
and famous athletes…

201
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,875
didn't make me happy at all.

202
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,879
Hey, Akira!

203
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,216
I was just showing off!

204
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,344
I was just lying to myself
to feel less empty inside.

205
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,638
So, I pretended like I was having fun.

206
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,725
I was a horrible person… always bragging!

207
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,562
I'm the one who needs to say I'm sorry!

208
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,397
I really am!

209
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,357
I'm sorry!

210
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,778
Well, that makes sense.

211
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,866
That fun-loving panache of yours

212
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,620
always came through to make sure
we were all having fun!

213
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,541
That's right!

214
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:51,297
I wanted a job where I could
sincerely entertain my clients.

215
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,760
I actually

216
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:01,265
wanted to be a stand-up comic!

217
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,065
In that case…

218
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:15,363
Just quit already
and become one right now!

219
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,453
Take it from me!

220
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:25,706
You should always listen to your friends
when they give you advice!

221
00:19:26,207 --> 00:19:30,086
If you're a stand-up comic, get ready
and show me you can jump that distance!

222
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,756
Yeah!

223
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,800
Hey, Akira! Give me a hand!

224
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,343
This time, it isn't a joke!

225
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:22,847
<i>Is this how I'm going to die?!</i>

226
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:24,932
<i>Completely buck naked?!</i>

227
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,860
Akira!

228
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,654
Up you go!

229
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,622
What's the matter, Kencho?!

230
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,874
Were you bitten by a zombie?

231
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:56,380
I scraped… my balls!

232
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,720
{\an8}I didn't expect you to cry out
like a baby.

233
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,430
And buck naked too…

234
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,266
You idiot. It was
highly sophisticated new material

235
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,435
inspired by my rebirth as an entertainer.

236
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,937
New? You always do naked jokes.

237
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,149
I'll be doing that more often
from here on.

238
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:20,070
Oh man, I'd really like
to stand on a stage.

239
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:24,074
Hey, do you have
any connections from work?

240
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:27,203
Work? What's that? I've never done it.

241
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,915
Who's the one who looked like he was going
to die from the exploitative company?!

242
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,501
You looked worse than the zombies!

243
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,294
What the hell?

244
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,004
You?! A stand-up comic?!

245
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,923
What kind of comic cries?

246
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:51,352
Anyway, you were seriously amazing today!

247
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,815
Guys who quit their jobs, drop everything,
and move on with their lives

248
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,401
tend to be really successful later on.

249
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:02,488
Like entrepreneurs or artists…

250
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,533
You might even be…

251
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:12,039
the guy who saves us all
from the zombie infection.

252
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:16,919
Me?

253
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,672
No way. That's not gonna happen.

254
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,173
Yeah, probably not.

255
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:22,967
That ain't happening.

256
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,473
Whoa, I just thought up a new bit!

257
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,850
It probably involves you
getting naked, doesn't it?

258
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:39,858
32. DRINK AND LAUGH
33. MEET DREAM WOMAN

259
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,777
<i>Next time: Flight Attendant of the Dead.</i>
