1
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,941
Get rid of it.

2
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:49,067
What?

3
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,737
What's the point
of taking in a sickly dog?

4
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:58,619
As my daughter, you have a responsibility
to rise above your peers.

5
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,079
In order to do that,
you must toss aside the weak.

6
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,123
Don't waste your time.

7
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,584
Only do what you need to succeed.

8
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:11,131
Unless you want to end up
on the street like that pathetic dog.

9
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,555
Everyone!

10
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,183
Today, we're welcoming Tendo and his crew!

11
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,726
Let's go all out and celebrate!

12
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,686
Cheers!

13
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,064
Cheers!

14
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,615
Drink up, everyone!

15
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,160
This is my way of showing
how much I appreciate

16
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,622
all the hard work you put
into the company everyday!

17
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,500
Do you think
nailing a zombie would infect you?

18
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,252
Are you seriously
after that zombie hipster chick?

19
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,214
What can I say. She's totally my type.

20
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,258
Hey newbie! Can't you see I need a refill?

21
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,385
Coming!

22
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,139
-Stop tripping everywhere, damn!
-I'm sorry.

23
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:02,307
Pull yourself together!

24
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:03,892
-You're ruining the vibe!
-Sorry.

25
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,895
-Weren't you a working professional?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,898
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,654
-Eventually, I'll lead Japan!
-I'll fill up your glass.

28
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,906
Idiot!

29
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:20,534
I don't want some old bag's booze!

30
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:24,913
I only accept drinks from young women.

31
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,291
Hey, you, over there.

32
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,293
{\an8}Pour me a drink.

33
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,438
Here. Ditch the water and stop acting
like you're too good for this.

34
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,189
Drink up.

35
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:56,069
Or are you saying you won't accept
a drink from your boss?

36
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,998
You swallow like a champ.

37
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,959
There's something else
I want you to swallow.

38
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,131
Try being friendlier.

39
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:19,009
Be nice or let me fondle your tits.

40
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,845
That's all women are good for anyway.

41
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,514
-Hey newbie, where are our orders?
-Hey, Tendo. Booze.

42
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,682
I asked for fries too.

43
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,100
Hey, Tendo!

44
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,352
Yes! I'm sorry.

45
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,484
-What did you want?
-Booze. I'm out of booze.

46
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,320
Yes! I'm sorry.

47
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,572
Here you go.

48
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,952
It's empty!

49
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,871
Why are you giving me an empty bottle?

50
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:55,462
Who fixed your car, patched up your buddy,
and let you sleep in a safe place?

51
00:04:55,545 --> 00:05:00,091
All you need to do is shut up
and do exactly what I tell you!

52
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

53
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,970
I'll bring you a new one right away.

54
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,348
<i>Need to succeed…</i>

55
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,808
<i>Need to win…</i>

56
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,812
<i>And to do that, you need to obey me.</i>

57
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,815
<i>Even before I could talk,</i>

58
00:05:14,898 --> 00:05:17,359
<i>my father kept telling me</i>
<i>what I needed to do</i>

59
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:21,112
<i>so much that I thought</i>
<i>my name was "Anita."</i>

60
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,449
<i>In his youth, my father</i>
<i>went to the States alone,</i>

61
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,285
<i>and within his lifetime</i>
<i>built a massive corporation.</i>

62
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,454
<i>He weathered the Lehman Brothers collapse</i>

63
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,541
<i>to become a calculating</i>
<i>and cold-blooded financier</i>

64
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,626
<i>that even the Americans feared.</i>

65
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,129
<i>As his daughter…</i>

66
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,091
<i>perfection was always expected of me.</i>

67
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,011
Sorry to hide you here.

68
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,098
If Daddy finds you, he'll kick you out.

69
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,811
Is that all you can say?

70
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,648
Then I guess I'll name you Roo!

71
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,902
You're not hungry?

72
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,489
Are you not feeling well?

73
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,158
INTRO TO VETERINARY SCIENCE

74
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,100
Roo?

75
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,687
Are you better now?

76
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,522
Thank…

77
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,858
Thank goodness.

78
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:45,238
I'm so… I'm so glad!

79
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,867
Oh, Roo!

80
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,037
You want to become a doctor?

81
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,498
There's a high risk of being sued,
and they don't make a lot of money.

82
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:56,791
What's the point?

83
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,502
Doctors and lawyers
are to be used by people like us.

84
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:03,089
You need to stand above them.

85
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,176
-But--
-We're done talking.

86
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,263
Regarding your possession in the attic,

87
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:13,642
I contacted the humane society
and had them put it down.

88
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:16,770
What?

89
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:21,691
Who do you have to thank for this life
of luxury in this house?

90
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:25,362
All you need to do is shut up and obey me.

91
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:33,119
You need to finish what you've started.

92
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,414
You don't need to hang around
with those who are less than you.

93
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,085
There's no need to date that boy.

94
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,672
Marriage is a means
for peers to reproduce.

95
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,591
<i>-Need, need, need…</i>
-You're in a different class than him.

96
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,550
<i>Shut up already.</i>

97
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:52,305
<i>But if I don't obey him,</i>
<i>I can't survive here.</i>

98
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,435
<i>I need to obey his every word.</i>

99
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,565
Hey!

100
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,319
What do you think you're doing
to my precious goods, idiot?!

101
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,865
Looks like you'll need to work tomorrow
and over the weekend to finish this!

102
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,828
-But you promised it would end today!
-Hey!

103
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,247
You're a waste of my food!

104
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,709
Do you know how much loss
I've incurred because of you?

105
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,211
Of course you wouldn't know!

106
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:28,800
A slow, dim-witted, stupid, and lazy wimp
like you generates loss just by living!

107
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,469
Your breathing
is a waste of company resources!

108
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:35,473
You could work here your entire life
and it wouldn't be enough!

109
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,233
But you know what, Tendo?

110
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,778
That's what I find so charming about you.

111
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,365
Chief?

112
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,577
The reason I'm so strict with you

113
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,496
is because I actually
have confidence in your abilities.

114
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,749
So, stay.

115
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,045
-But…
-Think about it, Tendo.

116
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:10,759
What's driving you to go back out
into a dangerous world like that?

117
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,219
Freedom is tough.

118
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,014
You have to make every decision yourself.

119
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:21,269
What to eat, where to sleep,
when to take a crap…

120
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:23,980
Try thinking about that all the time.

121
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:25,732
It's not easy.

122
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,776
It will drive you off the rails.

123
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:32,781
Tendo, I don't want you
to end up that way.

124
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,325
That's why I'll tell you what to do.

125
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:39,788
Listen to me, and you won't need to think.

126
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:43,041
I'm kinda jealous
of the chance you're getting.

127
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,544
Put your wants aside.

128
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:51,382
All you need to do
is stay and follow my orders.

129
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,055
Shizuka, do you see all those poor people?

130
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,184
Those are people who have lived
how they've wanted to.

131
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,186
You're different from them.

132
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,855
Put your wants aside.

133
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:11,569
In order to win, follow my orders
and do only what you need to do.

134
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,574
As my daughter,
don't become an embarrassment.

135
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,286
Are you listening?
I'm saying this for your benefit.

136
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,205
<i>It's actually…</i>

137
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,415
<i>for your benefit, isn't it?</i>

138
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,836
All right!
I'm going to drink so much today!

139
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,089
You're not done
until you've carried all of those out!

140
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,216
Okay!

141
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,904
100 THINGS I WANT TO DO
BEFORE BECOMING A ZOMBIE

142
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,626
{\an8}1. CONFESS TO THE GIRL I LOVED

143
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,544
32. DRINK AND LAUGH WITH MY BEST BUD

144
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,670
You're such…

145
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:11,588
36. BECOME A SUPERHERO

146
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,881
…a weird guy.

147
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,677
35. REMEMBER MY CHILDHOOD DREAM
36. BECOME A SUPERHERO

148
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,557
FRESH

149
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,058
There!

150
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,937
Amazing. What a great haul!
We got a lot today!

151
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,691
Have you ever noticed that Kosugi

152
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,945
never helps with any
of the dangerous acquisition runs?

153
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:40,783
Idiot! Just be happy we don't get
treated like the rest of the laborers!

154
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,327
Okay!

155
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,078
Did you close the door?

156
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,290
We don't want any zombies
getting into the truck.

157
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,374
I'm sorry!

158
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,337
-Let's hurry up and pull out!
-Okay!

159
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,968
As promised, it's been two days.

160
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:03,306
As we agreed,
we'll be getting out of here.

161
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,141
Sorry, Akira.

162
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,018
You went through all that for me.

163
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,479
But that ends today.

164
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,521
Actually…

165
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,565
About that…

166
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,027
I think I might stay

167
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,864
and keep working for the chief.

168
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,911
What are you talking about, Akira?

169
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,329
It's just…

170
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:28,331
It's dangerous out there.

171
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,793
And I'm not really cut out to survive it.

172
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,130
If I stay here,
the chief said he will look after me.

173
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,884
Hey, what the hell happened to you?

174
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,719
Hey, Akira!

175
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:42,637
Akira!

176
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:49,310
It seems Tendo really likes his job here!

177
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,395
All right.

178
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,065
In that case, we'll be leaving on our own.

179
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:56,067
Let's go, Kencho.

180
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:59,028
Hey, hold on!

181
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,406
-There's no way we can do that!
-Why not?

182
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,324
He says he wants to stay, after all.

183
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:08,454
I mean, I need to repay the chief
for everything he's done.

184
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:13,376
In order to do that,
I need to keep working here.

185
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,922
Need, need, need, need! Shut up already!

186
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:23,302
Akira, seeing as how we won't meet again,

187
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,722
let me tell you one last thing.

188
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,976
That man who's trying to make you
give yourself over to him completely…

189
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,895
Do you know what he's really after?

190
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:40,987
Well, he wants to dominate you,
and make you do what he wants.

191
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,490
Your free will, that's yours alone.

192
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,994
Your freedom to choose…

193
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,247
The self-respect you need to live…

194
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,248
Your soul!

195
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,624
Your pride!

196
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,837
He wants you to abandon them,
so he can take them from you.

197
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,799
He has no self-esteem,
and he's never satisfied.

198
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:07,430
All he can do is put others down
to make himself seem bigger.

199
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,852
That sad man
will do anything to assert himself

200
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,521
and get a brief sense of fulfillment
by demeaning you.

201
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,026
Until today, I was just like you are now.

202
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,405
But you were the one
who finally opened my eyes!

203
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:30,536
I'm not handing myself over
to anyone ever again!

204
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,247
Do you need to leave?

205
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:34,791
Do you need to stay?

206
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,377
With the uncertain state our world is in,

207
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,297
no one can say
what the right answer will be.

208
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,634
But at the very least, right now,

209
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,180
I want to get away
from this gross shithead

210
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:54,185
as soon as possible
with every fiber of my being!

211
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,235
Honestly, this is why women
are such trouble.

212
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,696
They immediately go into hysterics
and there's no use talking to them.

213
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,490
Right, everyone?

214
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,953
Well, Akira? What will you do?

215
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,455
You're not a machine or a zombie.

216
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,416
You're still human, aren't you?

217
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,338
What do you actually <i>want</i> to do?

218
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,850
36. BECOME A SUPER HERO
37. TELL OFF MY JERK OF A BOSS

219
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,104
How long are you going
to keep spouting nonsense?

220
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,355
Give me that!

221
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,108
Who cares about what you want to do?!

222
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,651
You don't need this!

223
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,364
{\an8}1. CONFESS TO THE GIRL I LOVED

224
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,438
What do you think you're doing, Tendo?

225
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,982
Who gave you permission to…

226
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:23,941
Chief.

227
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,821
Thank you for taking care of me.

228
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,575
But this is where we part ways.

229
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,077
I don't want anything to do with you.

230
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,707
I never want to see you ever again!

231
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,590
But you still owe me.

232
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,344
I won't be able to make it up to you!
Please accept my apologies!

233
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,387
That's irresponsible, don't you think?

234
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:54,680
My apologies!

235
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,807
But I was good to you!

236
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,392
My apologies!

237
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:00,645
You'll regret this!

238
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:06,400
Trash like you will be zombie food
the moment you step outside!

239
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,237
Even so, that's fine, right?

240
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:12,281
It's better
than being worked like a zombie

241
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,368
while not being able
to do a single thing I want.

242
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,119
37. TELL OFF MY JERK OF A BOSS

243
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,748
The supply gathering team is back!

244
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,377
We pulled in a large haul today!

245
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,547
Check it out!

246
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:29,674
I bet you're going to be surprised…

247
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,266
Calm down! It's just one zombie!

248
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,184
-This is bad.
-Just stay cool and…

249
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,019
-I have to get away!
-Hey, wait!

250
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,771
I don't want to die!

251
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,204
Thank you.

252
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,497
Thank you!

253
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,540
Kencho!

254
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,000
Shizuka!

255
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,543
-We're okay!
-No!

256
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,545
Hey, over here! Hurry!

257
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,839
Damn it!

258
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,467
Damn it. We can't save them all!

259
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,556
Stay back! Stay back!

260
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,684
Get away from me, you damn zombies!

261
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,104
Chief.

262
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:35,823
The food truck…

263
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,125
Hey, delivery team! I have an idea.

264
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,377
Will you help?

265
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:53,633
I'm not built for running!

266
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,938
Tendo?

267
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,777
Chief! Now's our chance!
Hurry and get over here! Hurry!

268
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,280
That Akira… Why is he helping that guy?

269
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,573
Akira!

270
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,202
I thought you didn't want
anything to do with him?

271
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,412
I don't,

272
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,416
but standing by while
someone's about to get eaten by zombies

273
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,879
isn't on my bucket list!

274
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,051
Now!

275
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,029
We're counting on you!

276
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,114
All right!

277
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,910
Now then…

278
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,412
Let's go!

279
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,871
Go?

280
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,166
-We're not going to jump from here, right?
-One.

281
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,167
Two.

282
00:20:10,251 --> 00:20:11,419
Three!

283
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,481
Akira!

284
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:35,818
You're amazing, Akira!

285
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,486
Good job, newbie!

286
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,529
That was amazing!

287
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,447
Thank you!

288
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,907
I only pulled it off
thanks to all of your help.

289
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:43,909
Don't be so modest!

290
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,619
Shizuka!

291
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,789
We managed to pull through!

292
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,416
Good grief.

293
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,376
Honestly,

294
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,671
you're always doing something crazy.

295
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,799
-It wasn't that great.
-I wasn't giving you a compliment.

296
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,184
As expected from my subordinate!

297
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,352
He was a fine example, wasn't he?

298
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,147
You need to take after Tendo
and, from now on, be more--

299
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,440
Sorry, Kosugi.

300
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,319
But I'm done working for you.

301
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:22,615
You're always making people work
while you do nothing!

302
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,949
You're a dictator.

303
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,244
That newbie was a better leader than you!

304
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,957
We've more than paid our dues.

305
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,794
It's about time we leave.

306
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:36,337
Thanks so much.

307
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,840
We brought this stuff in,
so we're going to haul it out!

308
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,342
No, wait!

309
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,302
Guys! Wait!

310
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,846
-I treated you well, didn't I?
-Let's go.

311
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:49,266
Wait… Please! Hey!

312
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,604
Please wait!

313
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:02,988
You're joking, right?

314
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,907
You really don't remember?

315
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,826
I don't.

316
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:11,121
I blanked out
whenever the chief was around.

317
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:17,628
That said, working sucked!
Maybe I'm not cut out for it!

318
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,216
It feels like
I'll never find the right job for me.

319
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,470
Is that so bad?
There's no rush to find a job.

320
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:27,513
What?

321
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,767
Online personalities,
esports athletes, drone pilots…

322
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,020
New jobs are created all the time.

323
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,273
Ones we couldn't imagine
a hundred years ago…

324
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,609
{\an8}We don't know
what tomorrow will bring in this world.

325
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:45,447
{\an8}Or what jobs there will be.
It's anyone's guess.

326
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:50,286
So do what you want to do
and enjoy doing it.

327
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,288
Enjoy it for all it's worth.

328
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:57,418
Eventually, one day, one of those things
may become a job that only you can do.

329
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,340
You're right!

330
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,304
{\an8}KUROMATSU, GUNMA

331
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:04,818
