1
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:10,594
{\an8}One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand,
one hundred thousand…

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,973
Amazing! This solid gold watch is sick!

3
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,184
I never would've made enough to own one

4
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,645
on my pitiful salary
at that exploitative company!

5
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:21,438
Oh, man, Akira.

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,858
Check this out!

7
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,030
One hundred thousand, one million…

8
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,534
Solid gold…

9
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,537
is something.

10
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,584
15. GET A SOLID GOLD WATCH

11
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,509
We're out of water, Kencho.

12
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:55,138
I figured. The power's out too,
and it's pitch black in the city.

13
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:59,393
Guess the water pumps gave out
when the electricity did.

14
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:03,689
Base station's down too.
I can't get online.

15
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,984
{\an8}Our phones are charged,
but we can't get any news.

16
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,989
We might be the only people
left in this big city.

17
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:15,117
<i>The number of zombies</i>
<i>are increasing daily.</i>

18
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,996
<i>It's getting more difficult</i>
<i>to secure food and water too.</i>

19
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:23,417
It may be time
we start taking this seriously.

20
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,714
<i>Food and a safe place to live?</i>

21
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,799
<i>Heroes aren't paid in food.</i>

22
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,468
<i>Do we start farming in the country?</i>
<i>Or hunt?</i>

23
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:37,180
<i>Can a ramen shop</i>
<i>survive in a zombie apocalypse?</i>

24
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:41,059
<i>Even after quitting my abusive workplace,</i>
<i>I guess I still have to work.</i>

25
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,855
<i>I wonder if there's any job out there</i>
<i>that I'd want to do now.</i>

26
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,483
Never mind that. Look, Kencho!

27
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,615
This is amazing!

28
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,701
Tokyo's not so bad!

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,329
Major power outages
aren't all that bad.

30
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,174
This brings back memories.

31
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:15,469
I'm sure they're alive and safe.

32
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,014
Yeah!

33
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:23,518
Let's head out to my hometown
that I haven't seen in a while. To Gunma!

34
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,241
Remember to pack light.

35
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,743
I know that!

36
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,997
Water and canned food, toothbrush,
nail clipper, camp stove, cook set…

37
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,959
I can just go to a convenience store
when I need a change of underwear, right?

38
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,796
No, I need to have some ready on the
off chance I spend the night with a lady.

39
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,008
That's packing light?

40
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,552
Is that really packing light?

41
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,397
Bye-bye, college life.

42
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:36,526
Bye-bye, office life.

43
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,950
How far is it to your parents' home?

44
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:49,164
Normally, it's a three or four hour drive,
but I don't know what the roads are like.

45
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,918
It could be long, so there's
something I absolutely want to get!

46
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,545
Are you talking about a real gun?

47
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:56,755
Nope!

48
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,925
<i>Equipped with a kitchen and bathroom!</i>

49
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,178
<i>A zombie-free space</i>
<i>where you don't have to worry!</i>

50
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,682
<i>A best friend for leisurely trips</i>
<i>where you can sleep whenever!</i>

51
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,936
<i>A house on wheels, where dreams</i>
<i>and a sense of adventure are made!</i>

52
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:15,690
<i>An RV is the only way to travel</i>
<i>in a zombie apocalypse!</i>

53
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,068
So can we do that? We only live once!

54
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,530
Can we travel in an RV?

55
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:24,366
I think it's a great idea!

56
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,410
{\an8}RV SHOW

57
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,336
What?

58
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,337
What?

59
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,548
Shizuka?

60
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,800
We sure run into each other a lot.

61
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,513
Come to think of it, you did say
you were headed out of the city.

62
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,181
What a coincidence.

63
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,225
I never expected to see you again so soon!

64
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,477
<i>It happened not just twice,</i>
<i>but three times!</i>

65
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:55,981
<i>This is definitely fate!</i>

66
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,234
Since you're here,
would you like to go to Gunma with us--

67
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,946
I don't have enough lives
to team up with you.

68
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,865
Since I see no benefit
in forming an alliance,

69
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:10,787
thank you for the offer,
but I'll have to decline.

70
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,001
Shizuka, do you have a license?

71
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,087
No. But this is a state of emergency.

72
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,132
I've come to realize that the best way
to travel long distances

73
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,385
while avoiding risks would be an RV.

74
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,554
You see them in zombie movies sometimes.

75
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,015
I didn't expect you to be
a fan of zombie movies.

76
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:34,394
I'm not. I just watched them
for reference purposes.

77
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:35,562
About 100 movies.

78
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,897
That's hard-core fan territory.

79
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:43,528
In any case, an RV is the travel standard
in a zombie apocalypse.

80
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:48,533
Right? I said the same thing!
You really should come with--

81
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:52,621
Thank you for the offer,
but I'll have to decline.

82
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,875
But you don't have a license, right?

83
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,918
Exactly.

84
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:03,298
Isn't it poor risk analysis to do
something unfamiliar like driving?

85
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:06,468
I'm sure you can see the benefits
of forming an alliance.

86
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,178
But even so…

87
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,513
It'll definitely be more fun
with three people!

88
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,308
That has nothing to do
with the issue at hand.

89
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,393
It'll be safer together with three people!

90
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,520
Let's go!

91
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,440
{\an8}RV SHOW ENTRANCE

92
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,695
-An RV show! Amazing!
-An RV show! Amazing!

93
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,489
That's so cool!

94
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,699
That's super cool!

95
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,078
This is crazy! What is this?
It's totally crazy!

96
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,665
Why does it have treads?
Why are they triangular?

97
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,376
This one has a crane attached!

98
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,463
Oh my god! What do we pull it with?
What do we pull it with?

99
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,340
Tatami mats!

100
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,218
A Japanese-style room?
Is it for tea ceremonies?

101
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,220
How hard is it to do?

102
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,891
There's a jacuzzi in the car! Wow!

103
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:59,062
Taking into account mobility
and speed in an emergency,

104
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,983
a four-wheel drive is a must,
since it has the greatest maximum output.

105
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:09,364
If we're going both on and off-road,
a midsize SUV would do the trick.

106
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,742
And considering
it might be difficult to refuel,

107
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,120
maybe we should go
with a hybrid crossover.

108
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:19,165
Furthermore, in terms of durability,
perhaps we should go with an import

109
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,626
rather than a domestic one
for the crumple zone.

110
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,505
Which means something like this
seems about right.

111
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,634
What the hell is this?

112
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,886
Twenty million?

113
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,390
An RV that costs more than twenty million!

114
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,437
I want this one.

115
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,856
I definitely want this one!

116
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:47,235
How is something that big going to get
through roads full of abandoned vehicles?

117
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,114
We're going with this one.
And that's final.

118
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,615
What?

119
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:57,370
Well, that one is cool,
but it doesn't look like an RV at all!

120
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:58,872
At all!

121
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,291
It's just a regular car, man!

122
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,751
Man!

123
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,629
We should at least pick one that has
a roof that pops out and becomes a tent.

124
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,258
Sleeping under a pop-up roof is like
advertising we're zombie food!

125
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,260
Come on now.

126
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,014
Life's boring if you only do
what you need to do all the time.

127
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:20,310
Shizuka, I bet there's a ride somewhere
here that'll get you going.

128
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:25,398
Honestly, we're in a crisis. Why would I
stoop to choosing based on…

129
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:35,784
<i>A coordinated dark color scheme</i>
<i>with indirect lighting.</i>

130
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,162
<i>A water hyacinth sofa and ikat tapestries.</i>

131
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:43,041
<i>What's with this interior?</i>
<i>It looks like a luxury hotel in Bali!</i>

132
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,584
<i>Oh, no. It's wonderful.</i>

133
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,045
<i>I think I might want it.</i>

134
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,883
I knew there would be one you wanted!

135
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,927
No! That one doesn't count!

136
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,305
Cars are all about dreams
and a sense of adventure!

137
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,932
Safety and utility!

138
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,062
Oh no! They found us!

139
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,731
We were too loud!

140
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,274
What should we do?

141
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,944
It doesn't matter which one!
Hurry up and get in!

142
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:14,948
What about the keys?

143
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:15,949
It's in the ignition!

144
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,618
Hurry, hurry!

145
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,959
17. RIDE IN AN RV

146
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,219
It's creepy how quiet it is.

147
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,722
The highway is usually packed on weekdays.

148
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,977
People probably didn't get
to run before the infection spread.

149
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,106
No virus in history
has spread this rapidly.

150
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,025
Shizuka, do you think this is a virus?

151
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:56,239
Aggression caused by hormonal changes
that affect the brain…

152
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,493
The only thing that could do that
is most likely a virus.

153
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,831
Analyzing data about the outbreak
and pinpointing methods of transmission

154
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,125
can help us work out
a possible countermeasure.

155
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,628
And there are
many other potential solutions.

156
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:15,258
If we can create a vaccine, we can
counter any sort of dangerous virus.

157
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,762
Theoretically, the world
isn't over just yet.

158
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,347
There's still hope.

159
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,894
Does that mean, somewhere out there,

160
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:32,525
there are people who are working
to stop the infection and save the world?

161
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,820
Who knows?

162
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:41,284
At the very least, it has nothing to do
with those of us who are barely surviving

163
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,912
each day dealing with zombies, does it?

164
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,459
We'll be leaving Saitama soon!

165
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,044
Gunma's in sight!

166
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,504
Before we do that, I'm starving!

167
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,174
Let's stop by a truck stop
to find something to eat.

168
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:59,052
It'll be getting dark.
We should also rest for the day!

169
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,931
All right!
This is our first night in an RV!

170
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,770
What's going on?

171
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,735
Kencho!

172
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,868
Are you all right?

173
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,120
What happened?

174
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,086
A spike strip?

175
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,136
What?

176
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,222
What's going on here?

177
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,978
Well, look who it is. If it isn't Tendo.

178
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,649
What do you think you're doing here,
skipping out on work?

179
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,152
You're…

180
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,905
Chief Kosugi!

181
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,453
I told you, your deadline
was first thing in the morning.

182
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,664
Why aren't you done with it, Tendo?

183
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,042
What? But Chief, yesterday
you said I had until tonight.

184
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,171
Did I ask for you damn opinion?

185
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:21,050
Damn it! You're always
creating more work for me.

186
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:25,805
Are you harassing me?
Are you harassing your superior?

187
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:28,808
If I get depressed, what are you gonna do?

188
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,439
Umm…

189
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,441
What's the matter?

190
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,359
<i>Cosgies.</i>

191
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,194
<i>A baseball team?</i>

192
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,949
I didn't expect you
to survive the apocalypse.

193
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:49,328
Chief, I'm glad to see
you're doing well too.

194
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,707
<i>What's going on?</i>

195
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,336
<i>My stomach is churning</i>
<i>and I can't breathe.</i>

196
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:04,343
I see you've gotten yourself
into a pretty sticky situation.

197
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,973
I doubt you can continue
your journey on those tires.

198
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,851
You should hurry up
and tend to your friend.

199
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,229
Want me to lend you a hand, Tendo?

200
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,859
Luckily, our truck stop

201
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:26,240
is fully stocked with food, spare tires,
and medical equipment.

202
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:30,912
We'll change your tires
and get your friend patched up.

203
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,246
Chief.

204
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm just so glad to see you again

205
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:40,004
here at the end of the world.

206
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,174
You have nothing to worry about anymore.

207
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,429
As your old boss, I'd never
abandon a former employee.

208
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,515
Just leave it to me!

209
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,518
Chief!

210
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,521
-Thank--
-However, in exchange, Tendo…

211
00:14:56,604 --> 00:15:01,526
How would you
like to work for me once again?

212
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,862
What?

213
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,657
What?

214
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,412
-But…
-I get it now. So, that's your racket.

215
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:15,248
You rob people's mode of transportation
with those things,

216
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,667
injure and manipulate them
when they're helpless,

217
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,962
and then put them to work cheaply.

218
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:25,174
That's a pretty uncharitable
interpretation, little lady.

219
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,053
The laws of the land
no longer exist in this world.

220
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:33,433
We had no choice but to lay these traps
to protect our precious friends

221
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,935
from ruthless looters.

222
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,938
I hope you understand.

223
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,192
You don't have much time.

224
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,529
All that noise earlier
is drawing them here.

225
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,740
Two days, Tendo!

226
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:54,579
You only have to help us
with a few chores for just two days.

227
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,168
I'm sure you'll work for me again,
won't you?

228
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,462
Well…

229
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,714
But…

230
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,883
However…

231
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:14,182
You don't want your friends
to become zombie food, do you?

232
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,484
Very well.

233
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:30,364
If it's just for two days,
I'd be happy to work for you again.

234
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,286
Atta boy!

235
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,664
We've got ourselves a contract!

236
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,251
KAMISATO
EXIT

237
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,509
Welcome to my company!

238
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,846
Starting today,
you'll be working the loading dock

239
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,350
and reinforcing the barricade.

240
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,229
They're simple jobs that anyone can do.

241
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,280
It'll be all right.

242
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,991
I'm sure it'll be difficult
since you're inexperienced,

243
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,912
but with the trust
that we've cultivated over many years,

244
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,748
you'll quickly regain a feel for things.

245
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:21,666
Okay.

246
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,003
{\an8}FIRST AID

247
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,756
I don't think you've fractured anything,

248
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,009
but you should rest up for the time being.

249
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,387
Damn it.

250
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,514
It's my fault Akira's…

251
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:39,517
They had this all planned out.

252
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,686
This isn't your fault.

253
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,312
Damn it!

254
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,649
If we could just change our tires,
we could be out of here!

255
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,402
We just have to tolerate this
for two days.

256
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,862
I sure hope that's the case.

257
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,251
My arms are so swollen!

258
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,920
When is this going to end?

259
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,258
This is just like
being back at my old job!

260
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,178
No. That's not what this is.

261
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,182
{\an8}I'm not who I was before.

262
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,728
{\an8}I decided I was finally going
to live life my way, right?

263
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,405
Everyone has been working
so hard in this heat.

264
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:37,325
Beer! Beer!

265
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,578
If I chill them now, I wonder
if they'll be ready by dinner?

266
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,955
That'll make everyone happy!

267
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,207
Hey, Tendo!

268
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,211
Chief.

269
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,214
This isn't your station.

270
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,633
What are you doing…

271
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,597
Hey! When did I order you to do that?

272
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,891
Umm… Uhh…

273
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,977
I was just doing this for everyone.

274
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,481
<i>Again? Why?</i>

275
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,318
<i>When the Chief's in front of me,</i>
<i>I can't think straight.</i>

276
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:19,742
Giving them chilled beer is just
a waste of our precious electricity.

277
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,370
Try something funny
like this again and you won't--

278
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,165
What is that, Kosugi?

279
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,126
It's beer!

280
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,836
What?

281
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,255
That's not for us, right?

282
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,384
You always stick us
with that warm cheap stuff.

283
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,135
Why the change of heart?

284
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,097
Yeah!

285
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:46,644
I just asked Tendo to chill these
for you guys tonight.

286
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,648
Of course,
there's enough for everyone here.

287
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,734
Tonight, we're having a welcome party
for Tendo and his friends

288
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,404
so you can rest
and recuperate from the day.

289
00:19:56,487 --> 00:20:00,950
This is just a small gesture
of gratitude for all the work you do

290
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,162
for the company around the clock.

291
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,790
You're so generous, Kosugi.

292
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,917
I'm glad I came with you.

293
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,921
Cut that out.
Flattery will get you nowhere.

294
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,598
What is that?

295
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,524
You're making zombies pull cargo?

296
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:39,113
They're a good workforce
if you know how to use them.

297
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,657
They're company equipment,

298
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:46,328
mere equipment with no will of their own,
and who can't think for themselves.

299
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:50,124
They just need to shut up
and keep working.

300
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,834
Equipment.

301
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,878
And Tendo…

302
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:59,258
Like them,
you're merely equipment as well.

303
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,179
It seems like

304
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:08,142
you thought you were
capable of achieving something special.

305
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:13,731
But you're far more worthless
than you think.

306
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:19,779
The best you can do
is to just follow my orders

307
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:23,783
and try to be as useful
as those zombies out there.

308
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:30,039
Pieces of equipment like you should just
labor away and drink warm, cheap beer.

309
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,416
Occasionally,
you'll get an ice cold beer.

310
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,419
There's no greater happiness
for you, right? Am I wrong?

311
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:40,591
If you get it, you'll be a good little
cog, stay quiet, and get back to work.

312
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,135
Got it? Damned piece of equipment.

313
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,937
Did Akira seem kinda off today?

314
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,441
I know the guy is his old boss,
but why is he just taking it like that?

315
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,199
You never forget.

316
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,746
<i>Even if your mind knows</i>
<i>that they're unfairly controlling you…</i>

317
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,833
<i>Your heart never forgets</i>

318
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,960
the fear.

319
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,693
<i>Next time: Truck Stop of the Dead.</i>
