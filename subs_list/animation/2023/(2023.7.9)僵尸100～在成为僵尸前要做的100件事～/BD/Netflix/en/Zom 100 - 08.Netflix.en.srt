1
00:00:00,504 --> 00:00:01,338
{\an8}CLASS 1 RIVER
KARASUGAWA, GUNMA

2
00:00:01,422 --> 00:00:05,968
{\an8}Kencho, Shizuka,
have you heard of mindfulness?

3
00:00:06,051 --> 00:00:08,220
Immersing yourself in the present,

4
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:11,265
and freeing yourself
from the past and future, right?

5
00:00:11,348 --> 00:00:13,600
We went over it a lot
in corporate seminars.

6
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:15,144
That's right.

7
00:00:15,227 --> 00:00:20,107
I aspire to maintain that mindset
at all times.

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,819
Listen, Akira.
I'm going to give it to you straight.

9
00:00:24,695 --> 00:00:26,530
I don't think you need to do this.

10
00:00:26,613 --> 00:00:30,117
You're already there
with your mindfulness or whatever.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,119
27. TRY SUP YOGA

12
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:35,372
Man, things are going great!

13
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:38,375
I've got 15 out 100!

14
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:41,795
I may be able to complete
all 100 of them within a month!

15
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:45,424
I feel like you might get eaten
by a zombie once you do.

16
00:00:45,507 --> 00:00:47,551
How long until we get
to your parent's place?

17
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:49,219
About an hour, I suppose.

18
00:00:49,303 --> 00:00:51,388
That is if nothing happens, right?

19
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:54,516
Do you know how many days it took for us
to get here from Tokyo?

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,311
We just have to get there
before the end of summer!

21
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:05,527
What's going on?

22
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:07,905
A survivor?

23
00:01:07,988 --> 00:01:09,865
They lost a wheel and can't move!

24
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:11,200
All right!

25
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:13,744
It's been a while,
but it's time for my shark suit!

26
00:01:13,827 --> 00:01:16,872
What? You're just gonna charge in there?

27
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:18,790
Well, never mind.

28
00:01:20,042 --> 00:01:21,793
Stop right there, you zombies!

29
00:01:21,877 --> 00:01:25,255
I won't let you do
whatever you want anymore!

30
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:30,302
Superhero of Justice, Akiraiger, is here--

31
00:01:38,769 --> 00:01:39,770
SLASH

32
00:01:44,024 --> 00:01:45,025
CHOP

33
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:48,946
SHOOT

34
00:01:49,029 --> 00:01:50,155
CROSSBOW

35
00:01:53,158 --> 00:01:54,368
KILLING

36
00:01:57,287 --> 00:02:00,582
{\an8}KILLING FIELD

37
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:12,052
What's this? Are we in a period drama?

38
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:13,845
That's so cool!

39
00:02:14,304 --> 00:02:15,347
<i>Danke schön.</i>

40
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:19,768
I owe you all a debt of gratitude
for your assistance.

41
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:20,894
What?

42
00:02:21,853 --> 00:02:24,982
My name is Beatrix Amerhauser.

43
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:28,652
A foreigner?

44
00:02:28,735 --> 00:02:30,404
A girl?

45
00:02:30,487 --> 00:02:32,614
I don't even know where to begin.

46
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:08,835
So, Beatrix, you came here from Germany
because you're a big fan of Japan?

47
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,087
<i>Ja!</i>

48
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:13,090
Nippon's culture is so wonderful!

49
00:04:13,173 --> 00:04:16,635
Kyoto, Fujiyama, tea ceremony, ikebana…

50
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:20,097
I love this country,
so I've studied all of them a lot.

51
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,432
So that explains the Japanese armor.

52
00:04:22,516 --> 00:04:26,103
That said,
it's not a bad anti-zombie strategy.

53
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:28,730
Refrigeration.

54
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,108
Fish?

55
00:04:31,692 --> 00:04:35,737
I have reasons to deliver this fish.

56
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:38,824
That is not possible anymore.

57
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:43,620
Seeing that you are all
brave samurai, I have a request!

58
00:04:44,204 --> 00:04:49,876
Would you please help me
deliver this fish to Takasaki?

59
00:04:51,795 --> 00:04:54,464
I suppose we could stop by Takasaki, but…

60
00:04:54,548 --> 00:04:58,969
If she's transporting food to survivors,
shouldn't we help?

61
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:01,805
Even so, considering the risks
of going near a city…

62
00:05:03,348 --> 00:05:05,434
Why do you want
to transport that fish so badly?

63
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:09,730
Ever since I was exposed
to Nippon's culture on TV as a child,

64
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:13,525
I've dreamed of coming here.

65
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:18,780
I worked many jobs saving up money,
but the morning I landed in Narita,

66
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:20,157
the pandemic was already…

67
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:25,412
The beautiful Nippon
I dreamed of was gone.

68
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:30,292
But after admiring Nippon's culture
for so many years,

69
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,919
I just had to see it
and experience it for myself.

70
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:35,797
And at last, I found it!

71
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:39,926
The last surviving sushi chef!

72
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:42,429
Sushi?

73
00:05:42,512 --> 00:05:45,807
The <i>taisho</i> of this <i>sushi-ya</i> told me
that if I could deliver fish to him,

74
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:49,936
he would let me have
my fill of delicious sushi!

75
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,190
<i>-She's just in it for sushi?!</i>
<i>-She's just in it for sushi?!</i>

76
00:05:54,107 --> 00:05:55,358
Beatrix.

77
00:05:56,735 --> 00:06:01,323
It's clear to me that your love
of Japanese culture is pure and true.

78
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,074
Regarding that fish…

79
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:07,579
We'll deliver it to that sushi place
in Takasaki even if it costs us our lives!

80
00:06:07,704 --> 00:06:10,582
<i>-He's only in it for the sushi too!</i>
<i>-He's only in it for the sushi too!</i>

81
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:15,086
<i>Danke schön!</i> You are a true samurai!

82
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:18,215
Now that that's decided,
let's hurry, you two!

83
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:22,594
The fish is losing quality
every second we stand around!

84
00:06:22,677 --> 00:06:25,847
It's time to show her
the spirit of hospitality!

85
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:26,973
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

86
00:06:28,308 --> 00:06:32,354
The <i>sushi-ya</i> is down an alleyway
past Central Ginza.

87
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:34,856
A back alley! I get the feeling
this place has a long history!

88
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,857
TAKASAKI
CENTRAL GINZA

89
00:06:35,941 --> 00:06:38,235
I get the feeling
that it's a famous place!

90
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:42,739
But the last time I talked to him
over the phone was over three days ago.

91
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:45,825
I sure hope the <i>taisho</i> is all right.

92
00:06:48,703 --> 00:06:51,623
How many of them are there?

93
00:06:52,207 --> 00:06:54,251
Shall we get going, Beatrix?

94
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:56,253
Okay, Akira!

95
00:06:56,336 --> 00:07:01,007
Well, it's nice that you're motivated,
but do you have some sort of plan?

96
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:02,551
-Nope!
<i>-Nein!</i>

97
00:07:03,343 --> 00:07:06,346
Is charging in head first
the only thing they can think of?

98
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:09,182
-I might have a plan.
-What?

99
00:07:11,852 --> 00:07:14,437
"All under heaven
is not for one man, but for all men."

100
00:07:15,438 --> 00:07:19,401
If we're going to do this,
we will all pig out on delicious sushi!

101
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:21,278
We're doing <i>Three Kingdoms</i> now?

102
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:25,782
Hey! This way, you zombies!

103
00:07:25,866 --> 00:07:30,787
What do you think of this tasty
piece of ass?! Get a bite, if you can!

104
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,627
This way!

105
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:39,337
Come on!

106
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:40,839
Now, Akira!

107
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,467
Beatrix!

108
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,970
Please leave this to me.

109
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,604
INVINCIBLE

110
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:07,115
Shizuka, I've rounded up
as many as I could!

111
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:09,993
-Are you ready?
-Of course.

112
00:08:10,702 --> 00:08:12,120
It is just as I planned.

113
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:13,288
All right!

114
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,093
The time has come!

115
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,514
Now! Unleash the flames!

116
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,017
-Okay!
-Time for a barbecue!

117
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:41,775
Hey, isn't this a bit too many?

118
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:44,653
Hurry up and light the fire!

119
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:45,779
-Okay!
<i>-Ja!</i>

120
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,031
What?

121
00:08:48,114 --> 00:08:50,533
This match doesn't want to light.

122
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:51,534
Hurry!

123
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,164
This is bad.

124
00:08:56,873 --> 00:09:00,585
At this rate,
our RV will be buried in zombies!

125
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:02,504
No way.

126
00:09:03,046 --> 00:09:05,256
If that happens,
the fish we transported will be…

127
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:08,510
We can't fight that many.

128
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,720
It's all over!

129
00:09:11,346 --> 00:09:12,222
Fear…

130
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:15,684
is just an excuse not to act.

131
00:09:17,018 --> 00:09:18,687
It's not about whether we can or can't.

132
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,566
It's about whether we have
a burning desire to <i>want</i> to do it!

133
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:27,654
<i>-He just wants to eat sushi.</i>
<i>-He just wants to eat sushi.</i>

134
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:31,741
If we can't eat
at a nice sushi restaurant,

135
00:09:31,825 --> 00:09:33,702
I'd rather become a zombie!

136
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:49,926
Incoming!

137
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:01,563
<i>Oshite mairu!</i>

138
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,358
Beatrix!

139
00:10:05,984 --> 00:10:09,362
I'm sorry about
my shameful behavior earlier.

140
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:11,865
I will no longer waver.

141
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:17,495
-Let's do this, Akira!
-Okay!

142
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:50,904
-Akira!
-Leave it to me!

143
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,372
Why you…

144
00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:03,792
They just keep coming!

145
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,919
Akira, at this rate…

146
00:11:13,218 --> 00:11:16,429
That's my Walkman!

147
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:18,807
And we'll do this.

148
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:26,523
What are you going to use it for?

149
00:11:26,606 --> 00:11:31,277
We don't know what'll happen,
so we should prepare a backup plan.

150
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:32,570
This is…

151
00:11:35,907 --> 00:11:36,950
{\an8}The zombies are…

152
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:39,911
They're being lured away!

153
00:11:43,623 --> 00:11:47,043
I didn't want to do this
because it would cause more damage,

154
00:11:47,126 --> 00:11:49,045
but I guess I have no choice, do I?

155
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:51,881
{\an8}Once again, the time has come.

156
00:11:52,715 --> 00:11:53,800
Unleash the flame!

157
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,083
Yeah!

158
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:32,046
{\an8}Tonight we're pigging out
on fancy all-you-can-eat sushi!

159
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:35,258
DAIGINZUSHI
SUSHI

160
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:37,093
Delicious!

161
00:12:37,176 --> 00:12:38,511
What the hell is this?

162
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:41,598
I don't even have to chew.
It just melts in my mouth!

163
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:44,475
The vinegared rice
gently falls apart in my mouth.

164
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:47,604
And it's prepared with such care.
I have no complaints about this sushi.

165
00:12:48,146 --> 00:12:50,607
It's firm and has
the right amount of sweetness.

166
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,860
I've never eaten anything like this,
even when entertaining clients in Ginza!

167
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:56,654
I may have moved back home to Gunma,

168
00:12:56,738 --> 00:13:01,409
but I've been honing my skills
for about thirty years in Tsukiji!

169
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:04,871
You came to eat my sushi
even at the end of the world!

170
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:07,874
Eat as much as you like today!

171
00:13:07,957 --> 00:13:10,126
Perhaps I'll try the gizzard shad next!

172
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:11,377
Another bottle of cold sake!

173
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:14,881
So tasty! It's so tasty
that I could keep eating this forever!

174
00:13:14,964 --> 00:13:18,092
Nice sushi restaurants are the best!

175
00:13:26,392 --> 00:13:28,519
How is it, Beatrix?

176
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:31,731
It's bitter.

177
00:13:32,482 --> 00:13:36,319
Bittersweet, but delicious.

178
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:39,447
I'm really happy to be here!

179
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,784
Welcome to Japan!

180
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:46,663
I can't believe
you're shedding tears over my sushi.

181
00:13:47,372 --> 00:13:50,625
I worked every day, without any days off,

182
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,045
even on my daughter's wedding day
and on the day my wife died.

183
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:57,048
I've never felt so honored as a chef.

184
00:13:58,132 --> 00:14:00,301
You guys are probably my last customers.

185
00:14:00,426 --> 00:14:04,597
Tonight, you can drink
all the sake in the restaurant!

186
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,307
Are you serious, <i>Taisho?</i>

187
00:14:06,391 --> 00:14:08,059
You're so generous!

188
00:14:08,142 --> 00:14:10,311
7. PIG OUT AT A NICE SUSHI RESTAURANT

189
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:15,191
So, this is one of Nippon's heat waves.

190
00:14:15,274 --> 00:14:17,318
They are not to be underestimated.

191
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:21,823
We haven't had a proper bath in days now.

192
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:24,951
Bathing in a river
just makes us smell swampy.

193
00:14:25,034 --> 00:14:27,829
I just want to bathe in some
pristine hot water once in a while.

194
00:14:27,912 --> 00:14:29,330
With that said…

195
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:31,666
We're going to a hot spring!

196
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:32,834
{\an8}16. KICK BACK IN A HOT SPRING

197
00:14:34,502 --> 00:14:35,837
-Amazing!
-Amazing!

198
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,923
-Hot water fields are amazing!
-Hot water fields are amazing!

199
00:14:42,302 --> 00:14:43,344
I knew it.

200
00:14:43,428 --> 00:14:46,848
I fear it may fall out
even with the men's robe.

201
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:49,058
I wish I had your problems.

202
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,104
You both look splendid!

203
00:14:53,187 --> 00:14:56,316
When I worked at that exploitative
company every hour of the day,

204
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,485
I never dreamed
of taking a vacation like this!

205
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:01,988
So, this is a hot spring town!

206
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:07,160
Most European cities
are built around a town square.

207
00:15:07,243 --> 00:15:11,873
But you only see that in hot spring
towns in Japan, so it's a very rare sight.

208
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:16,085
They are built
around the gushing hot springs!

209
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:18,880
I see. As usual,
you're quite knowledgeable, aren't you?

210
00:15:18,963 --> 00:15:20,965
Kusatsu Hot Spring was always at the top

211
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:22,675
of the National
Hot Spring Efficacy Record,

212
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,053
which was published
between the Edo and the Meiji period.

213
00:15:25,136 --> 00:15:27,347
She knows more about Japan
than any Japanese person.

214
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,433
They claimed they could cure everything
but love sickness.

215
00:15:30,516 --> 00:15:33,895
They also drew visitors
from all over the country!

216
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:36,189
Everything but love sickness?

217
00:15:36,272 --> 00:15:40,651
Then hopping in one
won't cure my feelings for Bea!

218
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:43,154
Love?

219
00:15:50,495 --> 00:15:54,248
Normally, this would've been
a good place to go on a date.

220
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,794
Sorry you're stuck with us.

221
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:05,218
Dating is a waste of time and resources
for what amounts to temporary pleasure.

222
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:08,971
Your 20s are better spent
acquiring the knowledge and skills

223
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:11,182
to get promotions and earn more money.

224
00:16:11,808 --> 00:16:15,311
You can think about whether you need
a partner once you've done that.

225
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:18,147
That sounds like something
you would say, Shizuka.

226
00:16:18,398 --> 00:16:22,819
But for me, life would be more fun
with someone I liked,

227
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:25,655
and I feel like that way
I would work harder too.

228
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:29,492
How ridiculous.

229
00:16:31,035 --> 00:16:33,871
You might fall for someone
who doesn't love you back

230
00:16:33,955 --> 00:16:36,582
or become the object of affection
of someone you don't like.

231
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,460
Love is an investment
with poor cost performance.

232
00:16:40,128 --> 00:16:41,504
An utter waste of time.

233
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:46,467
{\an8}LARGE OPEN-AIR BATH

234
00:16:48,052 --> 00:16:51,973
-A large open-air bath! It's huge!
-A large open-air bath! It's huge!

235
00:16:52,056 --> 00:16:53,307
I'm going first!

236
00:16:53,391 --> 00:16:54,642
Hold on!

237
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:02,775
Weren't you going
to kick back in a hot spring?

238
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:05,361
But I guess I can finally
wash away all the grime!

239
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:08,239
Let's leave the boys
and head to the women's bath!

240
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:12,994
Shizuka, this thing is,
there's no hot water in the women's bath.

241
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:15,997
-What?
-It appears the pump isn't working.

242
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,457
You're joking, right?

243
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:22,170
So, then, the only hot spring
is this men's bath?

244
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:27,842
These are extreme circumstances.

245
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:31,012
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

246
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:33,848
There's no need to be ashamed.

247
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:35,975
-Come join--
-Intolerable, obscene, revolting.

248
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,020
Every fiber of my being
is repulsed by you.

249
00:17:41,105 --> 00:17:43,399
You're wrong about that, Shizuka.

250
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,111
Since ancient times,
this country has had a…

251
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,868
In other words, let us not be ashamed!

252
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:58,789
<i>Konyoku</i> bathing is a proud cultural
and historical practice from Nippon!

253
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:03,794
-Thank you for loving our culture!
-Thank you for loving our culture!

254
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:16,390
There are so many of them!

255
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:23,397
This means we won't be able to kick back
at a hot spring!

256
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:24,774
What a let down!

257
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:27,902
I wanted to visit all the famous places!

258
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:31,280
Just when Bea was about to bathe with us!

259
00:18:32,615 --> 00:18:36,619
Damn it! Damn it all!

260
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,998
I don't think we can
make it back to the car.

261
00:18:41,082 --> 00:18:44,418
We just have to pray
that they'll eventually go away.

262
00:18:44,502 --> 00:18:46,546
That aside, what about the hot spring?

263
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:49,549
I still haven't got to kick back at all!

264
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:52,552
At least you got to soak in one
for a little while!

265
00:18:52,635 --> 00:18:55,054
I wanted to wash away my grime, too!

266
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:06,649
I'm thirsty.

267
00:19:10,778 --> 00:19:12,238
The sound of water?

268
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:22,707
Amazing.

269
00:19:23,624 --> 00:19:25,668
There's a hot spring
in the middle of the mountains.

270
00:19:30,756 --> 00:19:33,467
This seriously feels great.

271
00:19:33,551 --> 00:19:37,013
I bet heaven's got nothing on this!

272
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:44,979
Shizuka?

273
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:48,566
Sorry!

274
00:19:48,649 --> 00:19:52,486
I seriously didn't know you were there!
It really was an accident!

275
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:55,072
I get it already. Hurry up and get out!

276
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:55,990
What?

277
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:58,242
That's not fair!

278
00:19:59,452 --> 00:20:02,747
I wanted to kick back
in a hot spring this whole time!

279
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,125
If I have to leave without getting
in a hot spring after coming all this way,

280
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,502
I'd rather be eaten by zombies!

281
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:13,424
<i>He really only cares</i>
<i>about soaking in the hot spring.</i>

282
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,552
In… that case…

283
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:22,141
Make sure you stay on the other side
of the boulder!

284
00:20:22,224 --> 00:20:23,267
Okay!

285
00:20:23,351 --> 00:20:25,853
-And if you turn around, you're dead!
-Okay!

286
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:38,449
About earlier…

287
00:20:38,532 --> 00:20:39,742
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:41,285 --> 00:20:44,580
When I shot down your ideas about love…

289
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:50,211
My father never approved
of the way I lived my life.

290
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,173
When your opinions are always ignored,

291
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:57,718
it makes it difficult
to accept the opinions of others.

292
00:20:57,802 --> 00:21:00,221
In order to defend your position,

293
00:21:00,304 --> 00:21:04,767
you assert your legitimacy
by rejecting what others say.

294
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:09,271
But you're not concerned
about winning approval.

295
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:12,483
You just say whatever comes to mind.

296
00:21:13,526 --> 00:21:16,195
So it made me
a little jealous and frustrated.

297
00:21:17,196 --> 00:21:19,031
And the old me slipped out.

298
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:24,954
The truth is I'm just bad at romance.

299
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,748
I'm afraid of getting hurt.

300
00:21:28,582 --> 00:21:31,127
That's why I said work was more important,

301
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,920
and I was just trying to act tough.

302
00:21:34,171 --> 00:21:36,340
Shizuka, right now…

303
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:41,887
you're being very open.

304
00:21:44,724 --> 00:21:47,351
If I ever fall in love,

305
00:21:48,978 --> 00:21:53,524
I hope it's with someone
I can be this open with.

306
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,284
Wait, what I said just now…
I didn't mean it like that.

307
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,577
Huh? Huh?

308
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:07,955
So, does that mean…

309
00:22:13,627 --> 00:22:17,548
There's a hot spring
in the middle of the mountains!

310
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:21,218
{\an8}It's a <i>noyu,</i> a naturally occurring spring!

311
00:22:24,388 --> 00:22:27,641
{\an8}Since when did you two start hooking up?

312
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:28,809
{\an8}No, wait, this is…

313
00:22:28,893 --> 00:22:30,227
{\an8}It's not what you think!

314
00:22:30,311 --> 00:22:32,188
I wanted to soak in a hot spring too.

315
00:22:32,271 --> 00:22:33,898
How could you two go off by yourselves?!

316
00:22:33,981 --> 00:22:37,401
I don't wanna be a third wheel but I won't
forgive you for doing this behind my back!

317
00:22:37,485 --> 00:22:39,820
Let us soak in there too!

318
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:44,116
Stay out!

319
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,534
{\an8}This feels super great!

320
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:46,911
{\an8}Hot springs are the best!

321
00:22:46,994 --> 00:22:48,078
16. KICK BACK IN A HOT SPRING

322
00:22:48,162 --> 00:22:49,705
Hot springs are the best!

323
00:22:49,788 --> 00:22:50,831
<i>Konyoku!</i>

324
00:22:50,956 --> 00:22:53,125
I guess I have no choice.

325
00:23:46,762 --> 00:23:50,015
<i>Next time: Treehouse of the Dead.</i>
