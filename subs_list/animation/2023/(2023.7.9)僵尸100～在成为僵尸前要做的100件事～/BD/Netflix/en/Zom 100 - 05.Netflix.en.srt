1
00:00:02,548 --> 00:00:04,925
-Hey!
-We get it, already!

2
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:07,511
-Let go!
-We give up!

3
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:10,097
Sorry for picking on his dog!

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,015
We won't do it again!

5
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:15,102
Damn it! What the hell? He's just a kid!

6
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:16,437
Let's get going, already!

7
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:20,774
Thank you, Akira!

8
00:00:28,198 --> 00:00:30,826
The evils of the world
can't stand up to me!

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,830
The superhero of justice!

10
00:00:34,913 --> 00:00:37,291
Just leave it to Akiraiger!

11
00:00:59,813 --> 00:01:01,732
35. REMEMBER MY CHILDHOOD DREAM

12
00:01:04,276 --> 00:01:07,905
Hey, Akira, this is really bad.
All of Japan's like this, for real!

13
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:11,116
I don't think there are
any urban areas, or rather,

14
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:14,828
anywhere in the country
that's safe anymore.

15
00:01:17,122 --> 00:01:20,375
<i>It seems the Self-Defense Force</i>
<i>managed to isolate them in Hokkaido!</i>

16
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:24,755
And a number of villages in the mountains
were able to seal off access tunnels!

17
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:28,008
That means my family might still be safe.

18
00:01:28,091 --> 00:01:31,386
They're in Gunma,
"Kanto's best kept secret!"

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,269
So, why did you decide to go blond?

20
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:41,813
Seeing how you're doing
what you've always wanted,

21
00:01:41,897 --> 00:01:44,316
I figured I needed to do the same.

22
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,277
Kind of like my way of saying
I'm exiting the grind.

23
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:52,574
Besides, if I'm gonna become a comic,
this should make an impact, right?

24
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:04,086
Hey, Kencho…

25
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,005
I'm…

26
00:02:08,048 --> 00:02:10,676
thinking of becoming a superhero.

27
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:18,141
-I said, I want to become a--
-I heard you the first time.

28
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:23,605
By "superhero," do you mean
like Spider-Man?

29
00:02:23,689 --> 00:02:24,606
That's right!

30
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:28,235
This morning, I remembered something
from my childhood.

31
00:02:28,986 --> 00:02:29,861
<i>And that was…</i>

32
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:32,614
Go! That's it!

33
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:39,580
<i>…to fight danger and save those in need</i>
<i>in a kickass costume, for no reward.</i>

34
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:43,750
<i>That was the kind of hero</i>
<i>I dreamed of becoming!</i>

35
00:02:43,834 --> 00:02:46,670
Good idea, right?
You only live once, right?

36
00:02:46,753 --> 00:02:49,589
A hero of justice
who saves people from zombies!

37
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:52,134
Would it be all right if I do it?

38
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:57,597
Sure, if you want.
But you can't fly or shoot webs.

39
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,308
Good point!

40
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:03,061
I've been doing research
on ways to fight zombies!

41
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:06,315
That's how I discovered this!

42
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,402
{\an8}Now I get it.

43
00:03:10,485 --> 00:03:11,737
So, that's it.

44
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,363
Come on, let's go, Kencho!

45
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:14,865
Let's begin preparations!

46
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,451
What? Right now?

47
00:03:17,534 --> 00:03:20,245
Hey, at least let me get something to eat!

48
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,330
36. BECOME A SUPERHERO

49
00:04:53,463 --> 00:04:55,382
BRED IN CAPTIVITY
FOR THE FIRST TIME!

50
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:57,718
I haven't been to one of these
since I was a kid.

51
00:04:57,801 --> 00:04:58,635
Yeah!

52
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:01,054
The aquarium, huh?

53
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:09,396
It's in pretty bad shape, isn't it?

54
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:21,658
I'd be pissing myself right now
if this was still day one of the outbreak.

55
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:30,417
Doesn't it feel strangely exciting
walking in the back rooms of the aquarium?

56
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,710
I know what you mean!

57
00:05:31,793 --> 00:05:35,297
That feeling you're doing something
you shouldn't is kind of thrilling.

58
00:05:36,006 --> 00:05:37,215
Is it here?

59
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,805
-This is…
-Yeah!

60
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,558
As long as I have this,
then starting today,

61
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:48,351
I'm a superhero!

62
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:58,945
It's no good! We can't go any further!

63
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:02,824
For now, let's wait
until the zombies around us go away!

64
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:03,950
No way!

65
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:06,870
I don't want to die.

66
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:14,294
Are you all…

67
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:32,604
No!

68
00:06:42,364 --> 00:06:44,533
Someone, help…

69
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:53,041
<i>I don't want to die. I don't want to die.</i>

70
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:54,334
<i>I don't want to die!</i>

71
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:55,794
GREAT WHITE BRED IN CAPTIVITY

72
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:00,006
<i>If I can make it over there, I'll be safe!</i>

73
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,550
<i>I'll definitely be safe!</i>

74
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:11,726
<i>No. I don't want to die.</i>

75
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:15,146
<i>I don't want to die just yet.</i>

76
00:07:23,196 --> 00:07:24,823
Are you all right, miss?

77
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:27,784
Get going while you still can.

78
00:07:29,244 --> 00:07:31,246
It's the end of the line, zombies!

79
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,499
Akiraiger is here!

80
00:07:36,585 --> 00:07:38,795
How was that, Kencho?

81
00:07:39,546 --> 00:07:43,008
Well… I guess you could say
you kind of have the look down.

82
00:07:43,675 --> 00:07:45,886
-So, this is what you were talking about?
-Yeah!

83
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:50,932
Shark suits are diving suits designed
to protect your body from shark bites.

84
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:54,519
They're used when cleaning
shark or crocodile tanks!

85
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:57,939
It's made from a mesh of titanium
and high-strength steel fibers

86
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:00,859
that act like chain mail.

87
00:08:00,942 --> 00:08:03,111
Even large sharks can't bite through it.

88
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:04,404
I see.

89
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:06,656
In other words,
as long as I have this suit,

90
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,700
I'm invulnerable to zombie bites!

91
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,537
I've become an invincible superhero!

92
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:17,042
Invincible, huh?

93
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:20,295
More people in need of help!

94
00:08:20,837 --> 00:08:21,880
This way!

95
00:08:21,963 --> 00:08:24,174
It's safe inside the aquarium.

96
00:08:25,383 --> 00:08:26,509
<i>It's her.</i>

97
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,054
<i>Miss Risk Analyst!</i>

98
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:35,727
<i>I didn't think I would run into her here.</i>
<i>It's a miracle.</i>

99
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,812
<i>This must be fate.</i>

100
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:41,566
<i>Is he cosplaying?</i>

101
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,360
Akira!

102
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,326
<i>This is the best chance to show off!</i>

103
00:08:51,952 --> 00:08:54,871
<i>I'm going to show her how cool--</i>

104
00:08:54,996 --> 00:08:57,791
That hurts!

105
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:03,838
-Okay, right this way.
-Why does it hurt so much?

106
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:05,090
Ouch! No!

107
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:07,217
I get it.

108
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,846
It's puncture proof. It blocks teeth,
but you'll still feel the bite.

109
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:15,266
It hurts! Save me, Kencho!

110
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,853
Not happening.
There's only one suit, after all!

111
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:20,271
Don't worry about us.

112
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:23,483
Sorry, but you'll have to handle that
on your own! Bye!

113
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:25,735
No way!

114
00:09:25,819 --> 00:09:28,738
Kencho!

115
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,744
Ouch! Stop struggling!

116
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:39,874
It's over.

117
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:42,752
We should be all right for a while.

118
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:45,672
<i>That look…</i>

119
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:48,091
She was definitely turned off by that.

120
00:09:51,136 --> 00:09:54,431
Being a superhero is hard work.

121
00:10:02,355 --> 00:10:06,234
I'm safe! I thought it was all over!

122
00:10:06,317 --> 00:10:08,111
We're safe for now,

123
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:10,071
Kencho.

124
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:13,199
Hey, well done, hero.

125
00:10:13,283 --> 00:10:14,617
You're horrible.

126
00:10:16,327 --> 00:10:17,787
Don't be like that.

127
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:19,873
You ended up being a decent hero!

128
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:27,130
Something going on with her?

129
00:10:27,213 --> 00:10:30,050
Well, I met her once before.

130
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:33,845
Go talk to her.

131
00:10:33,928 --> 00:10:34,888
What?

132
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,400
What a coincidence,
running into you again.

133
00:10:51,821 --> 00:10:53,114
Oh, umm!

134
00:10:53,239 --> 00:10:55,784
We met at the convenience store before!

135
00:10:55,867 --> 00:10:57,494
Oh, yeah. Back then…

136
00:10:57,994 --> 00:10:58,912
Yeah.

137
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,960
My name is Akira Tendo.

138
00:11:06,044 --> 00:11:07,754
I feel like this must be fate.

139
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:10,924
-Maybe we should exchange contact--
-Akira, was it?

140
00:11:12,008 --> 00:11:14,135
Not that it's my business or anything,

141
00:11:14,219 --> 00:11:17,806
but in what way
do you <i>benefit</i> from saving people?

142
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,265
Bene…

143
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,185
That getup… Yes…

144
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:25,230
Psychologists call it identification.

145
00:11:25,313 --> 00:11:27,398
An inferiority complex or low self-esteem

146
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:30,944
often causes people to adopt
the look and mannerisms of their heroes.

147
00:11:31,027 --> 00:11:34,155
It's a psychological defense mechanism.

148
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:35,740
In short…

149
00:11:35,824 --> 00:11:37,116
It's what makes men

150
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,787
who are typically unvalued by society
and lack self-worth

151
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,831
wish they could become heroes.

152
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:44,249
<i>Harsh.</i>

153
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:46,501
Hold on, how could you say such a thing?

154
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:49,045
Akira saved everyone here
from those zombies.

155
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:54,133
He <i>managed</i> to save <i>complete strangers</i>
from zombies this time.

156
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:58,596
I don't intend to deny the fact
that he saved people.

157
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:05,562
But… Did you consider the danger
to those truly important to you

158
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:10,149
when you leaped into action
to mollify your low self-esteem?

159
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:15,864
Additionally, "hero" isn't a title
you can claim for yourself.

160
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:18,241
What one person considers justice…

161
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:19,367
<i>What…</i>

162
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,913
<i>She's super argumentative</i>
<i>and difficult to please!</i>

163
00:12:23,997 --> 00:12:26,708
-What? The outfit's got nothing to do--
<i>-But, she's right.</i>

164
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:31,754
<i>-Being a hero will put Kencho in danger.</i>
-We're just trying our best here!

165
00:12:33,548 --> 00:12:35,258
<i>What exactly is a hero?</i>

166
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:37,886
<i>What is a hero?</i>

167
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:39,262
Anyway…

168
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:44,976
If you still can't analyze risk,
you'll only lower my survivability.

169
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:49,272
I'm afraid I must decline your request
to exchange contact info yet again.

170
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:53,818
What's that noise?

171
00:12:55,153 --> 00:12:56,613
I'll go check it out!

172
00:12:56,696 --> 00:12:59,157
-Kencho!
-What? Me too?

173
00:13:00,658 --> 00:13:02,076
I guess I have no choice!

174
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,788
<i>What I should be doing now is…</i>

175
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:11,377
What is this? The water's…

176
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:12,670
Hey, Akira!

177
00:13:12,754 --> 00:13:13,755
Over there…

178
00:13:29,103 --> 00:13:30,730
A… shark?

179
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,651
Wait, but it has legs.

180
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:36,778
I see.

181
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:38,279
In that case…

182
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:40,198
What is it?

183
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:45,244
What's that?

184
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:46,371
What's that noise?

185
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:51,501
Everyone, run away!

186
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:54,128
It's a shark!

187
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:56,714
No!

188
00:13:58,716 --> 00:14:03,012
<i>What should I do?</i>
<i>What would a hero do at a time like this?</i>

189
00:14:05,932 --> 00:14:07,183
<i>At a time like this…</i>

190
00:14:09,978 --> 00:14:10,979
<i>What?</i>

191
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,776
For now, we just need to make
a tactical retreat, right?

192
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,319
What the hell is that?

193
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:21,656
It's a great white shark.
<i>Lamniformes Lamnidae!</i>

194
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:23,449
That's not what I'm asking!

195
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,493
Why is it walking on human legs?

196
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:27,912
The divers it ate
probably turned into zombies

197
00:14:27,996 --> 00:14:29,122
and are moving it.

198
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:31,708
Hold on, now!
How does that make any sense?

199
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,668
How am I supposed to know?

200
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:36,671
What's that?

201
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:38,923
Why aren't we running?

202
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:42,176
Zombies? There are some inside, as well?

203
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,803
We can't go this way!

204
00:14:43,886 --> 00:14:46,514
I'm pretty sure there was
a different emergency exit…

205
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,770
You're joking, right?

206
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:55,606
This way! Hurry!

207
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:01,279
-Everyone, this way!
-Hurry!

208
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:05,408
I don't want to die!

209
00:15:05,491 --> 00:15:08,453
Hey! Calm down!

210
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:10,455
I can't take it anymore!

211
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:12,832
Hurry!

212
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,800
We're safe, somehow.

213
00:15:24,719 --> 00:15:25,636
Huh?

214
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:27,472
Where's Miss Risk Analyst?

215
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:31,684
It's not my fault, it's not my fault…

216
00:15:32,226 --> 00:15:33,311
It's not my…

217
00:15:34,687 --> 00:15:37,023
No way, is she still out there?

218
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:39,901
Are you serious? Damn it!

219
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:42,695
It's no good! It's warped and won't open!

220
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,322
Akira! Help me out--

221
00:15:45,281 --> 00:15:46,199
Hey…

222
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:47,825
Akira?

223
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:52,872
Honestly…

224
00:15:53,414 --> 00:15:55,833
This is why I hate working in big groups.

225
00:15:56,334 --> 00:16:01,464
Panic spreads like wildfire.
I should've thought this through more.

226
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:10,473
Incoming!

227
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:18,648
Why you… Stop struggling!

228
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,488
Akira?

229
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:27,323
Why?

230
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,908
What are you doing here?

231
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:30,410
Isn't it obvious?

232
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:33,037
I'm here to save you.

233
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:38,292
There's really something wrong with you!
Why would you go so far as to do that?

234
00:16:38,376 --> 00:16:40,336
Enough with all the reasons!

235
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:45,716
When you're hungry,
you want to eat your fill.

236
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,845
If you see a cute girl,
you try to get to know her.

237
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,852
If I see someone who needs help,
I want to be a hero!

238
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:59,605
Do I need a reason for everything?!

239
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,276
<i>Even so…</i>

240
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,820
<i>If you die, it's all over.</i>

241
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,326
<i>Why do you go so far to go</i>
<i>straight for the things you want to do?</i>

242
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,585
What's your strategy?

243
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:22,503
I don't have one in particular!

244
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,130
I thought so.

245
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:29,385
-It's coming!
-Okay!

246
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,554
<i>This is bad!</i>

247
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:34,640
<i>I came here without thinking,</i>
<i>but we aren't getting any chances.</i>

248
00:17:34,724 --> 00:17:36,976
<i>-What should we do? What should--</i>
-Akira!

249
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,520
I have a plan!

250
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:44,817
This is such a ridiculous idea
that I can't believe it myself.

251
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:48,029
Do you want to risk it?

252
00:17:49,947 --> 00:17:50,781
Sure!

253
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:54,243
Hold on. What are they doing?

254
00:17:54,827 --> 00:17:55,953
I need to save them.

255
00:17:56,579 --> 00:17:57,872
I need to do something.

256
00:18:02,668 --> 00:18:03,544
<i>Damn it.</i>

257
00:18:04,086 --> 00:18:05,087
<i>I…</i>

258
00:18:06,756 --> 00:18:09,467
I knew it. It's not here. Akira…

259
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,178
Okay! You want me to buy some time, right?

260
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:14,597
Come at me!

261
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:24,774
That was close.

262
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:28,319
The Ampullae of Lorenzini?

263
00:18:28,402 --> 00:18:31,155
That's right! Sharks have sensory organs
in their heads

264
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:34,825
capable of detecting electric charges
as small as one millionth of a volt.

265
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:38,371
They use them to capture smaller fish
based on the electrical field

266
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:40,498
that their muscles generate.

267
00:18:40,581 --> 00:18:44,919
<i>A jolt of current to that sensitive organ</i>
<i>from direct contact with a human's muscles</i>

268
00:18:45,002 --> 00:18:47,380
<i>should confuse them enough to take it out!</i>

269
00:18:47,463 --> 00:18:49,549
<i>So, if we focus an attack there…</i>

270
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:52,009
<i>Yes! But it's still a bit unreliable.</i>

271
00:18:52,093 --> 00:18:55,846
<i>I'd prefer to have something that can</i>
<i>deliver a stronger electric current.</i>

272
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,098
All right!

273
00:19:07,191 --> 00:19:10,778
I still need to buy more time.

274
00:19:12,863 --> 00:19:13,948
Damn it.

275
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:15,283
My body can't…

276
00:19:15,366 --> 00:19:16,951
Hey!

277
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:20,871
Look over here, sharky bastard!

278
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:25,751
Does this ass look tasty or what?!

279
00:19:25,835 --> 00:19:29,088
Grab a bite if you can!

280
00:19:29,171 --> 00:19:30,381
Kencho.

281
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:36,846
No! On second thought, don't eat me!

282
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:42,852
<i>What is a hero?</i>

283
00:19:44,979 --> 00:19:46,397
<i>What is…</i>

284
00:19:47,773 --> 00:19:48,774
<i>a hero?</i>

285
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,361
<i>A hero is…</i>

286
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:54,739
<i>A hero is…</i>

287
00:20:00,828 --> 00:20:02,038
Akira!

288
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:05,541
<i>My target is the Ampullae of Lorenzini!</i>

289
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:10,129
<i>Discharging a battery for maximum effect!</i>

290
00:20:10,755 --> 00:20:13,382
<i>Will it work on a zombified shark?</i>

291
00:20:14,467 --> 00:20:16,302
I have no idea, but…

292
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:20,264
We just have to test it out!

293
00:20:21,015 --> 00:20:22,892
Crackle Thunder…

294
00:20:23,434 --> 00:20:26,270
Punch!

295
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:45,748
How was that? Miss! Kencho!

296
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:49,251
You nailed it! You're a total superhero!

297
00:20:51,087 --> 00:20:53,506
Not that it's my business or anything…

298
00:20:54,173 --> 00:20:57,134
But you've got bad taste in names.

299
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:02,682
Why are you leaving
without saying anything?

300
00:21:02,765 --> 00:21:04,934
Today, you were a real hero.

301
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:06,686
36. BECOME A SUPERHERO

302
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:11,065
It's fine. Heroes don't need rewards.

303
00:21:11,607 --> 00:21:12,608
What about you?

304
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:14,860
You okay not going with them?

305
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:19,281
We were only sharing a bus to the harbor.

306
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:23,077
Besides, I'm done with big groups.

307
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:27,206
What? You made a great team with Akira.

308
00:21:27,331 --> 00:21:29,667
What will you do?
Will you take this opportunity…

309
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,668
Out of the question.

310
00:21:30,751 --> 00:21:32,712
{\an8}I figured not!

311
00:21:32,795 --> 00:21:35,297
{\an8}You idiot! Why are you pulling back?

312
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:38,384
{\an8}Listen, the real attempts come
after you're rejected.

313
00:21:38,634 --> 00:21:40,594
It's just like doing sales!

314
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:42,596
I was never in sales…

315
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,515
That's not what I meant.

316
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:46,475
What's the matter?

317
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,102
Did you forget something?

318
00:21:48,185 --> 00:21:50,438
{\an8}100 THINGS I WANT TO DO
BEFORE BECOMING A ZOMBIE

319
00:21:50,521 --> 00:21:54,275
{\an8}My top priority is to do things
to avoid becoming a zombie.

320
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,780
But you two just want to do things
before becoming a zombie.

321
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:02,450
Our methods are incompatible.

322
00:22:03,284 --> 00:22:04,785
One more thing.

323
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,204
Despite all my warnings,

324
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:13,002
you still risked those precious to you
to save a stranger like myself.

325
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:17,256
I don't have enough lives
to work together with--

326
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:18,340
Yeah, but…

327
00:22:19,842 --> 00:22:22,720
You're someone precious to me now, Miss.

328
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,098
I'd save you
even if I wasn't trying to be a hero.

329
00:22:35,816 --> 00:22:37,735
Hey, Miss?

330
00:22:38,777 --> 00:22:39,987
What's the matter?

331
00:22:43,824 --> 00:22:45,451
Where will you be going now?

332
00:22:45,951 --> 00:22:46,994
Let's see…

333
00:22:47,077 --> 00:22:51,832
{\an8}Wherever I can find a place
that's safe and sustainable.

334
00:22:51,916 --> 00:22:54,752
{\an8}Who knows if a safe place really exists.

335
00:22:55,628 --> 00:22:56,712
{\an8}I almost forgot.

336
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:00,633
{\an8}Here, this is my QR code.

337
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,763
{\an8}I'm sure we'll never meet again.

338
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:14,480
There isn't much risk
in sharing contact information with you.

339
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:18,025
{\an8}SHIZUKA MIKAZUKI

<i>I hope I can see her again!</i>

342
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:26,408
So, what will we do now?

343
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:28,077
Let's see…

344
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,330
<i>Before I've realized it, it's been</i>
<i>seven years since I moved here.</i>

345
00:23:31,413 --> 00:23:33,040
<i>I met Kencho in college</i>

346
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:36,085
<i>and tasted intense despair</i>
<i>working at an exploitative company.</i>

347
00:23:36,168 --> 00:23:39,588
{\an8}<i>I came here, awed by the glitz</i>
<i>and glamor of the big city, but…</i>

348
00:23:40,756 --> 00:23:43,551
{\an8}Yeah! I think I've had my fill of Tokyo.

349
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:47,805
{\an8}I want my parents to see
that I'm doing okay.

350
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:49,598
{\an8}Well then, let's go!

351
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,644
{\an8}Yeah! To Kanto's best-kept secret! Gunma!
