1
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,514
Why are there zombies here?

2
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:14,598
I can't take this.

3
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,187
Are you already…

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,315
I'm still okay.

5
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,120
Incoming!

6
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,042
{\an8}<i>Wait for me, Mom and Dad!</i>

7
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,585
{\an8}<i>I'll be there soon!</i>

8
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,410
{\an8}ZOM 100: BUCKET LIST OF THE DEAD

9
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,412
GOOD FORTUNE

10
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,496
Charo!

11
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,915
Where are you, Charo?

12
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,292
Charo.

13
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,919
Charo!

14
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:10,505
Now is not the time to be humping things!

15
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,008
I was so worried about you!

16
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,648
It's dangerous to run off on your own!

17
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,275
But…

18
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,112
Mommy and Daddy are already…

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,741
Charo is all I have left!

20
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,169
Anyway, it isn't safe here.

21
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,590
All right!

22
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,052
I doubt those zombies can climb ladders!

23
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,764
Now we just wait
until the electric fence is deactivated.

24
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,266
Mr. Kencho, over there.

25
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,691
You're…

26
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,569
You're going down.

27
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:19,157
Each day, there was nothing for me.

28
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,620
I fell farther and farther
until I reached the pit of misfortune.

29
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,248
That's why you're
going to go down with me!

30
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,500
Mr. Kencho!

31
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:36,258
Just fall from here
and become zombie food!

32
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:42,013
I need to do whatever it takes
to stop the water wheel!

33
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,182
I see it!

34
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:14,421
Curios from the Warring States Period
are nothing more than junk,

35
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,173
especially against me.

36
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:23,430
I was in the top four in the high school
Kendo Nationals two years in a row.

37
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:27,768
Your samurai fangirling
is no match against me.

38
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,565
Mrs. Tome! Old Man Hiko!

39
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,942
We have to hurry and evacuate the village!

40
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:37,569
Shizuka!

41
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:41,072
If a horde of zombies come, they'll
break through this thin wooden door!

42
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,702
Shizuka, calm down and listen.

43
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,582
We're all old
and we have difficulty moving around.

44
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,796
Old Man Hiko
is mostly bedridden so we can't carry him.

45
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,423
Listen, Shizuka.

46
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,843
Don't worry about us
old-timers who don't have much time left.

47
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,679
Please. You must try to survive.

48
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,598
No way.

49
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,021
At this rate,
Mrs. Tome and the others will be…

50
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,484
Geez!

51
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,361
Over here, you dumb zombies!

52
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,740
-Shizuka?
-I'll get you out of there.

53
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,202
So don't give up!

54
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,375
I didn't analyze the risks at all!

55
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,295
It's definitely
because of those happy-go-lucky dorks!

56
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:44,970
The door won't hold for much longer!

57
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,142
Incoming!

58
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,356
Akira!

59
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,069
I haven't done enough yet!

60
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,117
I didn't make enough
to send you much money.

61
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:10,078
I never took you on any trips overseas.

62
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,624
I haven't found anyone to marry yet.

63
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,086
So giving you grandkids is a long way off.

64
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,841
I haven't done enough for you yet!

65
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,011
I'm not going to apologize
in front of your graves.

66
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,347
There are so many things

67
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,436
I want to do while you're still alive!

68
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,024
You greenhorn.

69
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,279
Dad?

70
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,490
You want to repay us that badly?

71
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,995
Then don't die before your parents.

72
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,498
Take care of your mom.

73
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,000
Da…

74
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,045
Dad!

75
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,592
Hey, come on, it's okay.

76
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:10,180
I don't want to go home yet.

77
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,266
-I guess I have no choice.
<i>-Not wanting to go home…</i>

78
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,311
<i>I feel the same way.</i>

79
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,104
{\an8}WEDDING PHOTOS

80
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:23,526
{\an8}<i>Like anybody, when I first got married,</i>
<i>I wanted a happy home.</i>

81
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,280
<i>But before I realized it,</i>
<i>that place stopped being my home.</i>

82
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:31,785
<i>So, everyday I killed some time at bars</i>
<i>and internet cafés before going home.</i>

83
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,538
<i>My car was the only place</i>
<i>where I could relax.</i>

84
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,836
I heard that Mrs. Yoneda's husband
was promoted to section chief.

85
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,548
Her whole family is going to Singapore
over the long weekend. Isn't that nice?

86
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:49,719
Anyway, we're going out
to eat as a family.

87
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:53,807
<i>My relationship with my wife</i>
<i>had already gone cold.</i>

88
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,811
<i>We would talk about once a week, but it'd</i>
<i>only be snide remarks or name-calling.</i>

89
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,564
<i>I no longer had the energy</i>
<i>to repair my relationships.</i>

90
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,193
<i>I wondered why</i>
<i>I was working myself to the bone</i>

91
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:09,239
<i>for a family</i>
<i>I had lost all love and affection for?</i>

92
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,909
My wife is such a bitch!

93
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,411
Whenever she talks,

94
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,998
it's to nag me to keep the bathroom clean
or to hurry to get a promotion.

95
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,334
Shut up already!

96
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,219
I found you!

97
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,228
A girl and I alone in a place like this.

98
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,856
I'm so lucky.

99
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,485
Lucky? What do you mean by that?

100
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:53,700
The thing I want to do most is
to "force my tongue down a girl's throat."

101
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,618
7. FORCE MY TONGUE DOWN A GIRL'S THROAT

102
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,079
This is even worse than a zombie!

103
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,831
You're not getting away!

104
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,375
What's the problem?
It's just a French kiss!

105
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,377
It's no big deal!

106
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,171
<i>No way! Absolutely not!</i>

107
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,383
<i>I'd rather be eaten by zombies</i>
<i>than be French kissed by that guy!</i>

108
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,595
<i>I've never had luck with women or money.</i>

109
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,805
<i>I've had nothing but bad luck all my life.</i>

110
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,976
<i>I'm saying goodbye to that unlucky life!</i>

111
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,937
<i>-Five</i> covers!
-Is the pasta ready yet?

112
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,899
-Carpaccio at table number seven.
-Come on! The orders are piling up!

113
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:26,858
Excuse me.

114
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:31,654
Was <i>"sette"</i> supposed to be six?

115
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,326
{\an8}Listen, you haven't learned
a single number yet.

116
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,578
How are you going to take orders?

117
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,373
But no one taught me anything.

118
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:48,338
And besides they could just tell me
in Japanese, right?

119
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,341
-He's making excuses again.
-He's always doing this.

120
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,179
Why are the senior workers and the owner
so mean to me?

121
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,434
I've got the worst luck.

122
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,686
Oops.

123
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:09,192
They're going to bitch about
how that's not the way good chefs behave.

124
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,329
<i>This is why I told them</i>
<i>we should put ashtrays in the kitchen.</i>

125
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,790
<i>Looks like I'm getting fired again.</i>

126
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,209
<i>I've really got the worst luck.</i>

127
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:32,090
So what if the restaurant burned down
because I forgot to put out my cigarette?

128
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,219
I lost my job just like everyone else!

129
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:40,223
I don't see why they had
to get so mad at me!

130
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:46,437
No matter how you think about it,
I'm the unlucky one!

131
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,110
Old Man Hiko?

132
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,864
Akemi?

133
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,083
Not bad.

134
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:10,211
<i>I can barely parry.</i>

135
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:16,968
The problem with this baby is that it
attracts zombies with the noise it makes.

136
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,929
So let's make this quick.

137
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,391
Why would you do something so evil?

138
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,976
Evil?

139
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,481
I'm only doing what's right!

140
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:35,820
But everyone just complains about me!

141
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:41,284
Mr. Takaoka,
the glue stick goes next to the stapler.

142
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,870
I've warned you countless times,
haven't I?

143
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,123
Section chief, I can't believe
you're rejecting my plan.

144
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,250
This workplace is barely functioning!

145
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:50,460
Department chief,

146
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,630
should you be letting people
who make such mistakes slide?

147
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,173
Was it the usual?

148
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,759
She did it again. Wow.

149
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:01,721
It's really exhausting
working with her, isn't it?

150
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,933
She's so self-righteous
and pushy about it!

151
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,018
Shut up.

152
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:14,776
You coddled snowflakes
are the ones at fault!

153
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,657
What have we ever done to you?

154
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,662
-Quit blaming others for your problems--
-I'm the victim here!

155
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,291
"I am the victim in the marriage"?
Don't make me laugh!

156
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,045
Just because she couldn't reach me
when she gave birth?

157
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:37,423
I was entertaining clients
when I didn't want to!

158
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:41,928
She continued to hold a grudge
about how scared she was being by herself!

159
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,931
No matter how you think about it,
I'm the victim!

160
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,684
I thought that was the case!

161
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:52,063
You can badmouth your woman
however you like,

162
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:57,819
but have you given her even a single
flower for a wedding anniversary?

163
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:03,074
Have you thanked her for taking care
of the house every day

164
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,327
or listened to her complaints
or true feelings?

165
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:13,584
Did you ever treat her
like she was the queen of your universe?

166
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:21,592
The reason she lost interest in you
is because you let her down!

167
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,137
You never made an effort to love her.

168
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,392
You never gave her anything,
and you expected her to take care of you?

169
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:33,104
She's not your mother!

170
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:36,607
Shut up!

171
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,985
Enough of that!

172
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:43,865
You two are going down with me!

173
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,533
Fine.

174
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:51,122
If you want to go down,
I'll go down with you as you wish!

175
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,999
Mr. Kencho!

176
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,378
What the hell are you thinking?

177
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,132
<i>What's triggering</i>
<i>the zombies to attack us?</i>

178
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,761
<i>Our movements? Our smell?</i>
<i>Or is it our body heat?</i>

179
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,512
<i>It doesn't matter what it is.</i>

180
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:12,310
<i>If I want to mask all of that,</i>
<i>this is my only option!</i>

181
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,151
Wha…

182
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:23,738
You're joking, right? Head first?

183
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,577
No. Stop!

184
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,914
Stay away!

185
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,682
If you're going to go down,
don't choose a pit of despair.

186
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:55,895
If you had chosen the cesspit,
you could've avoided becoming a zombie.

187
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,693
Don't come near me
until you've taken a bath.

188
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,780
<i>Akemi?</i>

189
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,909
Where did Akemi go?

190
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,120
Old Man Hiko,

191
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:16,833
Shizuka is using herself
as bait to protect us from the zombies.

192
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,338
And? What are you all still doing here?

193
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,548
What are we doing?

194
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,968
We're old.
We can't move as well as we'd like to.

195
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,553
Even if we went to save her…

196
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,807
Has anything ever gone the way
we wanted it to?

197
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:38,187
Large-scale projects declined
following the post-war land reform,

198
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,189
and the TPP was looming.

199
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,692
We were unsure
of who our successors would be.

200
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:48,281
Even so, we desperately clung
to our hoes and managed, didn't we?

201
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,326
Typhoons, sweltering heat, freezing cold…

202
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,622
No matter how many times
nature ferociously tried to beat us down,

203
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,375
we'd grit our teeth and say,
"This is the year!"

204
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,378
We've survived this long, haven't we?

205
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,883
Who cares about some zombies?

206
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,762
Hey, are you aware of
the recognitive hyper-focalization theory?

207
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,431
Recogni… What?

208
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,310
It's a theory that attempts
to scientifically define luck.

209
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,021
{\an8}Do you only care about yourself?

210
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:26,277
{\an8}Does your concern extend to family,
lovers, friends or complete strangers?

211
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,280
{\an8}All that matters is today?
Or Tomorrow too?

212
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:33,159
{\an8}Are you considering the next generation
or society as a whole?

213
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:38,122
When you face a challenge,
who else do you consider?

214
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:43,085
The larger the scope of your
consideration, the more luck you have.

215
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,796
Showing off how smart you are
even at a time like this?

216
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,798
Who cares about any of that?

217
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:51,636
At this very moment, I'm the lucky one!

218
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,555
You're the one with bad luck!

219
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,307
CAUTION FIRE DANGER

220
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,070
Old Man Hiko!

221
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,700
You really are the finest hunter
in the village!

222
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:19,205
That was just a lucky shot!
What's one old man going to do?

223
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,085
Who the hell are you guys?

224
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,340
Anyone who gets rough with our Shizuka…

225
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,551
…gets no mercy, no matter who they are!

226
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,970
Whippersnapper!

227
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,438
I was so close.

228
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:48,985
Why do I have such bad luck?

229
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,863
You only think about yourself
and the immediate present.

230
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:58,995
Someone so self-absorbed
will never be blessed with good luck.

231
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,621
Shizuka!

232
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,998
Are you all right?

233
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,749
Thank you!

234
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,459
I'm really lucky…

235
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,213
you all showed up!

236
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:18,347
Wrong-minded people who get in my way
should all become zombies!

237
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,891
I'm the one who is right!

238
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,022
In my country,

239
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,317
it's normal to toss your cigarette butts
on the ground as you walk.

240
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,780
Supermarket cashiers
chew gum as they serve customers,

241
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:39,869
and vacuuming on Sunday, a day of rest,
is rude because everyone wants to relax.

242
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,206
On your birthdays, you organize
your own party and treat others to food.

243
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:48,294
I'm sure that this all sounds
absurd to you.

244
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:52,798
But that was normal life for me.

245
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:57,053
Are you trying to say I'm wrong too?

246
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,849
I don't give a damn about your culture!

247
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:07,563
All wrong-minded people should
just shut up and become zombies!

248
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,114
No way!

249
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,284
You took advantage of the zombies
gathering here…

250
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,626
to destroy the water wheel
and cut the power?

251
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,545
That's just crazy.

252
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,758
This is absolutely
the wrong way of doing it.

253
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,805
There is no perfectly right way
of doing things.

254
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:46,727
There are all sorts of people
and they make the world a colorful place.

255
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:50,773
Perhaps instead of forcing
what you thought was right on others,

256
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:57,863
you should have stopped and questioned
whether you might have been wrong?

257
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:23,848
This certainly is a problem.

258
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,518
I can't get down from here.

259
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:36,944
Dad!

260
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,696
Don't open it!

261
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,115
Absolutely do not open it, Akira!

262
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,035
If you do, you'll be putting your mom
and the others in danger!

263
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,340
Dad.

264
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,805
Just a few more.

265
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,852
<i>This is terrible.</i>

266
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:11,604
<i>At a time like this?</i>

267
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:19,111
<i>Looks like my time has come at last.</i>

268
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,697
<i>How pathetic.</i>

269
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,700
Dad!

270
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,247
Higurashi?

271
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:32,708
Why are you saving my dad?

272
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,962
So, I was thinking.

273
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:39,965
You're pretty tough, right?

274
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:45,387
So, how can I make sure
you become a zombie?

275
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,139
That's when I got it.

276
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,851
I found the perfect situation!

277
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,646
Listen up.

278
00:21:53,729 --> 00:22:00,194
If you don't want me to kick your dad
down, open that door and get zombified.

279
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,905
You want to repay your parents, right?

280
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:08,744
Then show your dad
just how good a son your are!

281
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,414
<i>What?</i>

282
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,637
<i>Next Time: Hometown of the Dead III.</i>
