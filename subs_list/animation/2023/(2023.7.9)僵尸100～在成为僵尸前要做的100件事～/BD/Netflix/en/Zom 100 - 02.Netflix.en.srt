1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:05,631
What?

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,343
You woke up with a 38-degree fever?

3
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:10,802
So what?

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,265
Man, I wonder if we'll meet our deadline.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,976
You think you're gonna die from overwork?

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,020
Come talk to me
when you're actually dead!

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,523
No one leaves until we're all done!

8
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,026
Quit dozing off, Tendo!

9
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,528
Get up, you jerk!

10
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:30,030
I'm sorry, Chief!

11
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,119
What the…

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,792
<i>Oh yeah, I…</i>

13
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:45,379
<i>don't have to go to work anymore.</i>

14
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,601
Good morning!

15
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,771
My three years' worth of vacation time
starts today.

16
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:04,982
I'm gonna have so much fun!

17
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,177
All right!
Three years' worth of cleaning, done!

18
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,223
Clean house,

19
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,558
clean mind, huh?

20
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:08,647
I can't remember
the last time I felt this good.

21
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,608
All right.

22
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,780
I've been looking forward to this.

23
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,710
This is so good!

24
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:34,881
Who knew skipping work and drinking beer
in the morning would taste so good?!

25
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:39,177
This is holy water!
No. It's the drink of the gods.

26
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:43,765
The guilty pleasure of drinking beer
on what would normally be a work day!

27
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,685
The freedom from work and obligations.

28
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:51,982
If this isn't heaven,
then I don't know what is.

29
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,028
<i>This is an aerial footage of Tokyo.</i>

30
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,656
<i>Fires are blazing everywhere!</i>

31
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,201
<i>I still can't believe this is happening!</i>

32
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,872
<i>Even our studio is in danger</i>
<i>of being overrun by workers</i>

33
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,082
<i>who have turned into the living dead!</i>

34
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,502
<i>Internet and telecommunications are down,</i>

35
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,297
<i>and the government</i>
<i>has not made any announcement!</i>

36
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,425
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>if the government is still functioning--</i>

37
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,178
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK

38
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,431
I guess

39
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:28,602
things are pretty bad out there.

40
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,896
I wonder what will happen now.

41
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,942
But for me, today is beer day!

42
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,696
I'm gonna stay put in my room
with a cold beer in my hand

43
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,451
and embrace my inner degenerate
and rejuvenate myself after three years!

44
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,119
It's decided!

45
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,249
They're gone!

46
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,961
No way! What?

47
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:59,466
They're all gone!
Don't tell me that was the last one!

48
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,593
I've run out.

49
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,057
Of all the times to run out of beer.

50
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:14,356
<i>But I was gonna slack off today.</i>
<i>Now I have to go on a beer run?</i>

51
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,701
What a pain in the ass.

52
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,746
<i>But…</i>

53
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,749
<i>I can't bum around</i>

54
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,669
<i>without you!</i>

55
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,464
<i>I have no choice.</i>

56
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,133
KOSAKA

57
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,096
The police, the armed forces…
No one's coming to help us.

58
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,391
What are we supposed to do?

59
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,101
Don't give up.

60
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,770
If we can hold out
for just one more day…

61
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,647
How do we do that in this situation?!

62
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,316
How do we survive?

63
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,362
It's over. It's the end of the world.

64
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,406
Damn it!

65
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,366
What the hell do we do?

66
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,159
Someone.

67
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:09,995
Anyone! Help…

68
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,300
What's wrong? Is it a zombie?

69
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:27,304
-Who are you?
-What are you doing?

70
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,933
Sorry. The stairwell in my building
is crawling with zombies, so…

71
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,351
Anyway, come in.

72
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,312
We're still safe here.

73
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:40,275
Huh? No, it's okay.
I have to go out for a bit…

74
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,693
-Huh?
-Oh…

75
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,947
I'm Akira Tendo.
I live in the building next door.

76
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:49,868
It must be fate meeting you like this.
Nice to meet you!

77
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,748
Yes… I'm Kosaka.

78
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:57,876
By the way,
I'm going to the convenience store.

79
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,339
Can I bring you anything?
Instant noodles? Flashlights?

80
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,885
Uh, yes please…
That would be great…

81
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,804
If you can, get us some toilet paper!
The two-ply one!

82
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:10,972
Okay!

83
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,241
Looks like their numbers
have grown since yesterday!

84
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,329
<i>If they surround me, I may not be able</i>
<i>to get away, even on a bike.</i>

85
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,250
<i>Even so, I'd rather get eaten by zombies</i>

86
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,253
<i>than go a second without beer!</i>

87
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:50,929
BEER CIGARETTES

88
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,222
TROPICAL SWEETS

89
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,146
Beer! Beer!

90
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,608
All you can drink!

91
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,490
Beer! Beer!

92
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:14,077
Any and every kind of beer…

93
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,801
<i>A survivor?</i>

94
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:35,557
<i>Wait! I was singing</i>
<i>a super weird song just now!</i>

95
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,641
<i>So embarrassing!</i>

96
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,269
<i>She must think I'm a weirdo!</i>
<i>Yeah, I'm sure she does!</i>

97
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,815
<i>Oh, no! I also scared the Kosakas earlier.</i>
<i>I must try not to scare her off.</i>

98
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,235
Hello…

99
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,530
Are you out shopping too?

100
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:54,868
It's hard to get out
with all these zombies around, isn't it?

101
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,958
Well…

102
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,548
I was gonna be lazy
and drink beer all day, but I went out.

103
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,427
Huh? What--

104
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,015
Hey, excuse me!

105
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,062
Since we happened to meet like this,

106
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,858
do you want to exchange
your contact information?

107
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,862
In that case…

108
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,948
Not that it's my business or anything,

109
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:37,994
but risking everything to go out
to get something nonessential

110
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,498
is definitely not what I call
a high-priority task.

111
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,626
High-priority…

112
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:51,633
I can't see myself teaming up with someone
who doesn't know how to analyze risk.

113
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,971
I'd prefer not to lower
my chances of survival.

114
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:57,889
Hey!

115
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:01,768
So, I'll have to pass
on giving you my contact information.

116
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,896
Miss! Watch out!

117
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,651
What?

118
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,520
Thank you, Miss

119
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,438
Hey, my bike!

120
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,442
<i>I see.</i>

121
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,654
<i>I need to analyze the risk?</i>

122
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,950
<i>I guess the kind of stuff</i>
<i>you see in zombie movies</i>

123
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,161
<i>really does happen.</i>

124
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,627
<i>She was badass, and pretty too.</i>

125
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,965
<i>I wonder if I'll see her again.</i>

126
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,844
Damn it! Now's not the time
to be thinking about that!

127
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,347
I gotta run back home!
Nope, that's impossible!

128
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,809
What am I gonna do?

129
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,353
There must be something!

130
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,111
Now this is an upgrade!

131
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,864
<i>I forgot this all started</i>
<i>during rush hour.</i>

132
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,618
<i>Bikes and scooters are lying around</i>
<i>with their keys still in them.</i>

133
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,455
<i>With this,</i>
<i>I can travel much easier than on a bike.</i>

134
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,500
Hold on. Maybe…

135
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,794
there's an even better upgrade.

136
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,929
Yeah!

137
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,265
{\an8}Now this is the ultimate upgrade!

138
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:29,374
<i>I'm stocked up on beer, met a cute girl,</i>

139
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:32,418
<i>and even got the motorcycle of my dreams.</i>

140
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,005
<i>Today was great.</i>

141
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,592
I'm back, Mr. and Mrs. Kosaka!

142
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:44,013
I got plenty of beer
if you want to join me for a drink…

143
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,361
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Kosaka?</i>

144
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,296
<i>We could die today.</i>

145
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,426
<i>Or we could die 60 years from now.</i>

146
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,512
<i>Either way, there's never enough time</i>

147
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,098
<i>to do all the things we want.</i>

148
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:38,484
<i>Life's too short to avoid taking risks.</i>

149
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,747
<i>When I was a kid,</i>
<i>there were so many things I wanted to do.</i>

150
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,332
1. CONFESS TO THE GIRL I LOVED

151
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,376
<i>But I always found one excuse or another,</i>

152
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,879
<i>and ended up not doing those things.</i>

153
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,469
<i>I've decided to take a three-year vacation</i>
<i>to have as much fun as I can.</i>

154
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,386
2. CLEAN MY ROOM

155
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,305
<i>If I can't do the things I want to do,</i>

156
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,723
3. LOAF AROUND AND DRINK BEER

157
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,600
<i>I'd rather be eaten by zombies.</i>

158
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,858
4. RIDE A MOTORCYCLE
5. TRY OUT DREADLOCKS

159
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,881
I only have 30?

160
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,427
Things I wanna do…

161
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,888
Now that I've quit…

162
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,725
What I really want to do<i>…</i>

163
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,423
31. GO HOME AND SPEND TIME WITH MY PARENTS

164
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,512
32. WITH MY BEST BUD…

165
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:35,435
33. MEET THE WOMAN

166
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,687
OF MY DREAMS

167
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:39,689
Okay.

168
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:41,691
Yeah.

169
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:43,943
Done!

170
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,034
100 THINGS I WANT TO DO
BEFORE BECOMING A ZOMBIE

171
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,349
<i>I repeat… This is an emergency broadcast</i>
<i>for all city districts.</i>

172
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:20,021
<i>Everyone, please lock your doors securely</i>
<i>and do not leave your homes.</i>

173
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,982
<i>I repeat, this is an emergency</i>…

174
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,359
<i>Internet and telecommunications</i>
<i>are down.</i>

175
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:29,238
<i>…please lock your doors securely</i>
<i>and do not leave your homes.</i>

176
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,282
<i>…if the government is still functioning--</i>

177
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,970
<i>I can't contact the main office</i>
<i>in LA either.</i>

178
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,514
<i>The situation looks critical.</i>

179
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,936
<i>Secure food and water.</i>

180
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,522
<i>Acquire a sustainable energy source.</i>

181
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:06,067
{\an8}<i>Maintain mental balance.</i>
<i>Continue regular exercise.</i>

182
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,778
{\an8}<i>Minimize sugar intake.</i>

183
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:29,840
Yes.

184
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,177
I finally did it.

185
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,012
I…

186
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:37,848
I escaped.

187
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,226
I got away!

188
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:44,855
I see.

189
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,232
ZOMBIE ENCYCLOPEDIA

190
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,069
There are two types of zombies in movies,
slow and fast ones.

191
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:52,989
Walking.

192
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:54,448
Walking.

193
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,325
Running.

194
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:02,039
That solid body type
looks extremely dangerous.

195
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,085
Walking. Walking. Running.

196
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,672
Walking… Walking…

197
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:11,716
Dangerous.

198
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:16,178
Both types are currently
in this zombie pandemic.

199
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,057
If you can identify the type
when you encounter one,

200
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,476
your chances of survival
increase drastically.

201
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,733
I need raw data after all.

202
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,865
I need to gather certain supplies

203
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,868
before the number of infected
spikes again.

204
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,039
What area is the least risky
in this neighborhood?

205
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,378
<i>Camera, check.</i>

206
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,009
ALKALINE BATTERIES

207
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,510
COOKED CHICKEN FOR SALAD

208
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,783
<i>A survivor?</i>

209
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:22,161
<i>He doesn't seem to be infected.</i>

210
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,121
Beer! Beer!

211
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,291
Any and every kind of beer…

212
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,803
<i>He seems harmless.</i>

213
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,181
<i>Wait, there may be zombies behind him.</i>

214
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,809
<i>I knew it.</i>

215
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:45,893
Hello…

216
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:49,730
<i>They're far enough behind, but I should</i>
<i>get what I need quickly and leave.</i>

217
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:52,733
It's hard to get out
with all these zombies around, isn't it?

218
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,068
<i>He's the classic example</i>

219
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:58,781
<i>of a shortsighted person who's unable</i>
<i>to think beyond the present moment.</i>

220
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,159
<i>How could someone like him</i>
<i>survive this long?</i>

221
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:03,577
…and drink beer all day.

222
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,037
<i>It just doesn't make sense.</i>

223
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,209
<i>That sound… A car horn?</i>

224
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,629
<i>Not good. It'll attract zombies.</i>

225
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,341
If I go out now, there's
a high possibility of getting attacked.

226
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,886
<i>A barricade? No, there's not enough time.</i>

227
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,597
<i>So, how do I get through?</i>

228
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,102
<i>What's going on?</i>

229
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,353
<i>It's out of control.</i>

230
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,106
<i>The direction it's headed…</i>

231
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:33,524
<i>works in my favor.</i>

232
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:36,402
Not that it's my business or anything,

233
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:40,614
but risking everything to go out
to get something nonessential

234
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:44,160
is definitely not what I call
a high-priority task.

235
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,871
<i>So now…</i>

236
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,624
<i>I'll get as many as possible to follow me,</i>

237
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,419
<i>and if I can get the timing right…</i>

238
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,129
Miss! Watch out!

239
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,885
<i>Don't! That position is…</i>

240
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,096
What?

241
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,739
<i>A runaway truck driven by a zombie</i>
<i>crashes into other zombies…</i>

242
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,742
<i>What a magnificently perfect zombie trope.</i>

243
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:26,994
<i>Well,</i>

244
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,497
<i>I guess even crappy blockbusters</i>

245
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,041
<i>can give you some useful ideas.</i>

246
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,380
<i>Water has been secured.</i>

247
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,966
<i>Food, power, and fuel have been secured.</i>

248
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,387
<i>I managed to get some data too.</i>
<i>It could be better, but…</i>

249
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,139
<i>this is great.</i>

250
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,644
<i>The patterns in the behavior</i>
<i>of the zombies that I encountered today…</i>

251
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,400
<i>Beer! Beer!</i>

252
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,278
Who knew

253
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:05,533
that a single beer could make someone
that happy in a state of emergency?

254
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,793
SAKURA MOCHI

255
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,546
5. MINIMIZE SUGAR INTAKE

256
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:21,799
Oh well…

257
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:27,513
Maybe I should have grabbed
that <i>sakura mochi</i> after all.
