1
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:36,784
Man, stay-at-home camping is the best!

2
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:39,787
You can't even tell
we're in the middle of Tokyo!

3
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:40,913
I agree.

4
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:42,373
18. CAMP AT HOME
19. OIL PAINTING

5
00:00:42,457 --> 00:00:44,584
Oh, the food is ready,
so clear off the desk.

6
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:45,501
Sure.

7
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:47,670
Here you go.

8
00:00:47,754 --> 00:00:49,756
Time to dig in!

9
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,928
What is this? This is super delicious!

10
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:58,389
It's seafood, but there's
something different about it!

11
00:00:58,473 --> 00:01:00,183
Oh, you noticed!

12
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:02,310
The secret ingredient is prosciutto.

13
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:07,190
That aside, you can do anything,
can't you, Kencho?

14
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:09,192
No wonder you're so popular…

15
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:10,693
You idiot.

16
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:12,695
A guy's gotta know how to cook.

17
00:01:13,237 --> 00:01:15,448
No wonder you can't get a date.

18
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:20,745
<i>This damned… That's been</i>
<i>a pain point for me!</i>

19
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:23,164
I'll get one! You'll see!

20
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:25,124
Yeah, yeah. Wonder when that will be?

21
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:26,834
I'll get one today!

22
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,462
Today? You say that, but…

23
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,724
Well…

24
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:44,519
Good luck!

25
00:03:18,446 --> 00:03:19,489
I see.

26
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:22,492
"100 Things I Want to Do
Before Becoming a Zombie," huh?

27
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:23,493
{\an8}8. SEE AN AURORA

28
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:25,620
{\an8}That said,
"Wine and dine a flight attendant"?

29
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:27,538
That's aiming pretty high, isn't it?

30
00:03:27,622 --> 00:03:29,248
Quitting my job opened my eyes.

31
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:32,376
I'm gonna do everything I ever wanted.
No restrictions!

32
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:37,507
Scary how working at an exploitative
company really screws with your head, huh?

33
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,467
There's nowhere near 100 here.

34
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:44,680
Hey! Mind if I add my stuff to the list?

35
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:47,058
Huh? That's my list!

36
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:48,392
Crap! I died!

37
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:52,396
"Become a stand-up comic."

38
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,106
Hey! Stop it!

39
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,192
Now it's like I have to be one too!

40
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:57,944
33. MEET DREAM WOMAN
34. BECOME COMIC

41
00:03:58,027 --> 00:03:59,445
Big deal!

42
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:03,074
We'll just make this my list too.

43
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,452
If you didn't save me…

44
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:09,121
I'd be dead in some love hotel.

45
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:12,792
From now on,
consider me along for the ride!

46
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:16,712
Kencho.

47
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:19,715
Okay then! Can we hit up Ikebukuro?

48
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:21,759
I want a super big widescreen TV!

49
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:23,094
11. PLAY GAMES ON WIDESCREEN TV

50
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,852
We're screwed, Akira.

51
00:04:30,935 --> 00:04:33,938
To get into showbiz,
I need to go through a training school,

52
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:35,898
an agent, or an apprenticeship.

53
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,609
It seems I have a long way to go.

54
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:40,987
You don't need a mentor
to run around naked.

55
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,447
Why are you assuming that's my only bit?

56
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,577
Anyway, Kencho,
why do you want to be a comic?

57
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:51,330
Well…

58
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:55,710
Since I was a kid, I loved watching
comedy variety shows more than anything.

59
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,169
I guess…

60
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,715
I've always wanted to be one someday.

61
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:03,009
It was my dream.

62
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,636
<i>His dream, huh?</i>

63
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:09,181
<i>Come to think of it, what was my dream?</i>

64
00:05:09,682 --> 00:05:14,353
<i>Was getting hired</i>
<i>by that company really my dream?</i>

65
00:05:14,437 --> 00:05:15,605
Akira!

66
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:22,111
A dead end.

67
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:24,822
We'll have to find a different route.

68
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:27,074
This is terrible.

69
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:29,452
My widescreen TV is just within reach!

70
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:38,878
Is that… a tanker?!

71
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:41,756
This is bad, Akira!

72
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:43,883
If that thing crashes into us…

73
00:05:44,717 --> 00:05:46,802
Hey, what are we going to do?!

74
00:05:48,429 --> 00:05:49,388
Akira!

75
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:54,393
Hey, come on!

76
00:05:54,477 --> 00:05:57,647
What are we going to do?!

77
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:13,579
What?! Hey!

78
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,792
Don't tell me…

79
00:06:20,044 --> 00:06:21,253
you're gonna go for it?!

80
00:06:25,591 --> 00:06:29,887
He's going for it!

81
00:07:08,926 --> 00:07:09,844
Are you serious?!

82
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:12,805
We're racing through the underground mall
on a motorcycle!

83
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:14,473
It's no good!

84
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:20,271
The underground's full of zombies too!

85
00:07:20,354 --> 00:07:21,731
Kencho! On your right!

86
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,650
All right! If we can get through there…

87
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:26,402
We might find an electronics store!

88
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:28,946
-That's what you care about?!
-Come on! Hurry, hurry!

89
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,158
Follow the scent of the TVs!

90
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,868
Nothing stops you!

91
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,619
Ready? Go!

92
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:42,668
Whoa… I'm exhausted.

93
00:07:43,836 --> 00:07:46,881
Who knew buying a TV was this much work?

94
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:58,726
You two…

95
00:08:00,394 --> 00:08:02,938
You're not infected, are you?

96
00:08:04,065 --> 00:08:05,107
No!

97
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,902
Thank goodness! There are other survivors!

98
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:10,404
What are you so thankful for?

99
00:08:10,946 --> 00:08:14,075
We're trapped on all sides by zombies!

100
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:15,409
We're finished.

101
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:16,494
It's over.

102
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:19,413
Why is this happening?
I can't take it anymore!

103
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:26,796
Well, they might move on after a while.

104
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:29,673
Luckily, this is
a department store basement,

105
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:32,051
so we won't run out of food for a while.

106
00:08:32,134 --> 00:08:34,553
Let's try to stay positive for now.

107
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:37,932
You're right.

108
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:39,100
BEER - CIDER
WINE - WHISKEY

109
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:40,601
That said,

110
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:43,145
I'm gonna need to drink
to get through this.

111
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:46,148
Me too.

112
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:47,942
Do you guys want some too?

113
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,902
Okay. I guess we'll have some.

114
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:51,278
Here.

115
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:54,949
Since we're doing this,
want to look for some snacks?

116
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:56,117
Oh, okay!

117
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,910
{\an8}Yeah, I'll help too!

118
00:08:58,494 --> 00:08:59,703
{\an8}Huh?

119
00:08:59,787 --> 00:09:02,206
{\an8}This place hasn't been trashed at all.

120
00:09:02,289 --> 00:09:04,458
Um, I found some prosciutto!

121
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:05,709
-Good job!
-Nice!

122
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:08,212
Anyway…

123
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:11,048
Should we introduce ourselves?

124
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:15,010
Hold on a second. I'm pretty sure there's…

125
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:16,428
Hey, Kencho.

126
00:09:16,512 --> 00:09:17,638
Yeah?

127
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:20,057
<i>This…</i>

128
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:22,059
-Oh, here…
<i>-Kinda feels like…</i>

129
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:23,227
I don't need one.

130
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:25,729
<i>…we're wining and dining, doesn't it?</i>

131
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:32,945
My name is Kenichiro Ryuzaki.

132
00:09:33,028 --> 00:09:35,156
This is Akira. And you are…

133
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,699
It's all over.

134
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:38,742
-It's all over.
-What about you?

135
00:09:38,826 --> 00:09:39,702
Reika.

136
00:09:40,327 --> 00:09:41,203
I'm Maki.

137
00:09:41,704 --> 00:09:42,872
I'm Yukari.

138
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,173
We're college buddies.

139
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:55,467
What about all of you? Are you co-workers?

140
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,094
Pretty much.

141
00:09:57,178 --> 00:09:59,805
Our last flight was returning from LAX.

142
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:02,016
When we arrived in Japan, this happened…

143
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:06,770
Does that mean your profession is…

144
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:10,900
Yeah, we're flight attendants.

145
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:26,248
<i>I'm pretty sure we're…</i>

146
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:29,293
<i>It's hard to believe,</i>
<i>but we're definitely…</i>

147
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:33,380
Nice to meet you!

148
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:34,381
{\an8}<i>Wining and dining!</i>

149
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:37,051
{\an8}<i>We're wining and dining flight attendants!</i>

150
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:43,349
It's all over… We're done for…

151
00:10:44,308 --> 00:10:47,353
Could someone do something
about that noise?

152
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:50,898
I'll get more booze.

153
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:54,777
<i>What should I do?</i>

154
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,488
<i>This is what I've always wanted!</i>

155
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,324
<i>But they're clearly</i>
<i>not having a good time!</i>

156
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:02,451
<i>This is bad!</i>

157
00:11:02,534 --> 00:11:04,954
<i>When I was a student,</i>
<i>I only cared about club stuff.</i>

158
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:07,456
<i>When I was being exploited,</i>
<i>I only focused on work.</i>

159
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,918
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>what to do in this situation!</i>

160
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:13,754
<i>I can't be doing this!</i>

161
00:11:13,837 --> 00:11:15,506
<i>I need to bring up a topic!</i>

162
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:18,217
<i>It doesn't matter what it is!</i>

163
00:11:22,763 --> 00:11:23,597
So!

164
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:28,519
So Yukari, do you have a boyfriend?

165
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:32,147
Are you seriously asking me that
right now?

166
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:33,774
<i>You're right!</i>

167
00:11:33,857 --> 00:11:35,609
<i>It's totally not the time, is it?!</i>

168
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,945
<i>Oh no, I messed up!</i>

169
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:40,364
<i>How can I turn this around?!</i>

170
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:41,824
<i>Oh, I know!</i>

171
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:43,617
<i>Kencho could do something about this!</i>

172
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:45,202
You've got some nice nails!

173
00:11:45,285 --> 00:11:47,746
How often do you get them manicured?

174
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,374
Once a week, no biggie.

175
00:11:50,457 --> 00:11:51,333
What?!

176
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:53,210
<i>Don't go solo on me now!</i>

177
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:55,379
<i>And he's even making physical contact!</i>

178
00:11:55,921 --> 00:11:58,173
<i>Talking about their hometown</i>
<i>brought them even closer?!</i>

179
00:11:58,257 --> 00:12:00,384
<i>They're in a world of their own!</i>

180
00:12:01,176 --> 00:12:06,473
<i>I wish I had Kencho's good looks</i>
<i>or his way with words!</i>

181
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,185
<i>Kencho?</i>

182
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:12,146
I love them!

183
00:12:13,605 --> 00:12:15,774
<i>No wonder you can't get a date.</i>

184
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:17,943
<i>I'll get one! You'll see!</i>

185
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,903
<i>I'll get one today!</i>

186
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:23,157
<i>I can't let it end like this.</i>

187
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,660
{\an8}<i>I wanna get cozy</i>
<i>with a flight attendant too!</i>

188
00:12:27,202 --> 00:12:33,042
<i>I'd rather be eaten by a zombie</i>
<i>than let this opportunity pass me by!</i>

189
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,251
I'm Akira Tendo!

190
00:12:34,334 --> 00:12:36,754
I worked for three years
at an exploitative corporation.

191
00:12:36,837 --> 00:12:39,089
I've got more spirit and guts than anyone!

192
00:12:39,173 --> 00:12:43,218
So now, I'm gonna chug this tequila
in one go!

193
00:12:45,012 --> 00:12:47,514
Come on… Chugging tequila?

194
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:57,733
Go for it, gofer boy! Keep on going!

195
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:00,402
I won't be outdone by him!

196
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:04,990
That's great!

197
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:08,452
Muscles! Gonna dance now!

198
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:16,043
<i>After that, we had</i>
<i>a surprisingly good time.</i>

199
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:17,294
The mysterious basket!

200
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:27,554
I probably shouldn't have tried
to slam it.

201
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:32,309
I failed, but Kencho, as your friend,
I hope you score with Maki…

202
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:38,816
Excuse me…

203
00:13:41,026 --> 00:13:43,320
Are you all right?

204
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:48,075
Huh?

205
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:51,578
-There's bedding upstairs!
<i>-Could it be…</i>

206
00:13:51,662 --> 00:13:53,580
<i>-Maybe…</i>
-Then, I want a king-sized bed!

207
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,334
<i>Maybe…</i>

208
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,169
<i>Maybe…</i>

209
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:04,341
<i>I still have a chance?!</i>

210
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,722
Damn it, shut up!

211
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:16,687
Anyway, the airline industry's
a shadow of its glory days!

212
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:19,857
Because of the pricing war,
our pay doesn't increase.

213
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,692
But our work hours do!

214
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:23,902
My back aches
from standing up all the time!

215
00:14:23,986 --> 00:14:26,363
And it's so dry in the plane,
my complexion is awful!

216
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:30,367
Thanks to that, I've had to postpone
any ideas of getting married!

217
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:34,872
Don't think you can get all handsy
with a flight attendant, you bastard!

218
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:38,542
I can only keep it together because I tell
myself I'm a part of an elite group.

219
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:39,877
Don't think I'll let you screw…

220
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,049
What was that scream?

221
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:47,384
Did it come from downstairs?

222
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,636
What are you talking about?

223
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,388
Something doesn't seem right.

224
00:14:51,472 --> 00:14:53,974
Who cares? Can we go again?

225
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:55,601
One more time!

226
00:14:55,684 --> 00:14:57,311
Look, this isn't the time for…

227
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:01,148
Thanks.

228
00:15:01,732 --> 00:15:03,901
I'm feeling much better now.

229
00:15:05,736 --> 00:15:06,987
Thank goodness.

230
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:11,783
Um!

231
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:18,332
Why were you so concerned about me?

232
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:22,961
Well, it's just…

233
00:15:24,213 --> 00:15:27,132
You clearly went overboard back there.

234
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:30,052
Seeing that got me worried.

235
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:31,178
<i>Right. Of course.</i>

236
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:34,890
<i>No one would ever fall</i>
<i>for the tequila chugger.</i>

237
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:40,062
And to answer your question,
I do have a boyfriend.

238
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:44,525
We lost contact, but I'm sure he's alive.
And we'll find each other soon.

239
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:46,860
<i>Thank you!</i>

240
00:15:46,944 --> 00:15:50,822
<i>Thank you for letting me dream,</i>
<i>even if it was brief.</i>

241
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:56,745
<i>But that means she was</i>
<i>genuinely worried and went looking for me.</i>

242
00:15:59,164 --> 00:16:00,832
<i>What a really sweet person.</i>

243
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:04,211
Reika?

244
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:10,467
Reika!

245
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:13,845
I heard you scream suddenly,
so I was wondering how you were…

246
00:16:18,934 --> 00:16:20,978
Seriously?

247
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,482
Reika!

248
00:16:30,404 --> 00:16:31,405
Seriously?! Maki!

249
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:49,965
I killed her!

250
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:52,884
She was a zombie, but I killed her!

251
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:55,887
I'm sorry!

252
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:57,306
I'm really sorry!

253
00:16:58,974 --> 00:17:00,183
Hold on…

254
00:17:00,726 --> 00:17:01,768
Where's the old guy?

255
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:05,981
Akira, you said that you worked
at an exploitative company

256
00:17:06,064 --> 00:17:07,441
for three years, right?

257
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,528
It's my third year as well,
so I know how you feel.

258
00:17:13,113 --> 00:17:17,326
The job is physically demanding
and mentally exhausting.

259
00:17:17,409 --> 00:17:20,203
But I continued to do it

260
00:17:20,287 --> 00:17:24,207
because I believed
the passengers' lives depend on us, but…

261
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:28,962
The other day, an older man
got so angry about the flight delay,

262
00:17:29,546 --> 00:17:33,091
that he called us
a bunch of flying waitresses.

263
00:17:35,469 --> 00:17:37,596
That's horrible.

264
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,310
Those words made me question
why I worked so hard in the first place.

265
00:17:45,062 --> 00:17:46,521
In the end,

266
00:17:46,605 --> 00:17:52,944
it's my mistake for thinking it would be
the glamorous job of my dreams.

267
00:17:58,325 --> 00:18:01,995
In my case,
I just felt I had to go job hunting

268
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:05,332
and that I needed that job.

269
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:10,337
<i>I aspired to work at a production company</i>
<i>because it seemed glamorous.</i>

270
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,507
<i>But the industry was completely different</i>
<i>from what I thought.</i>

271
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,176
<i>The exploitation was</i>
<i>just my excuse for quitting.</i>

272
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:21,348
But now that I think of it,
the things I aspired to do

273
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:24,685
were just things someone else wanted.

274
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:28,230
It was just a borrowed dream.

275
00:18:31,983 --> 00:18:34,986
Whose dream was it
to become a flight attendant?

276
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,904
What?

277
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:40,283
If it's yours
and you want to keep doing it,

278
00:18:40,367 --> 00:18:42,744
who cares what some angry old guy thinks?

279
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,918
I…

280
00:18:51,753 --> 00:18:52,963
I…

281
00:19:05,892 --> 00:19:07,018
Yukari!

282
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:17,988
Yukari! Get up!

283
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:28,749
Yukari…

284
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:30,584
It's fine.

285
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:33,587
Hurry. Get going.

286
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,131
No…

287
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:37,424
I can't do that, Yukari.

288
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:39,676
Not after everything that we talked about.

289
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,136
I want to do more of that!

290
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:42,929
Yukari!

291
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,686
Earlier, when I was rubbing your back,
I remembered…

292
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:53,774
I remembered my first flight as a kid.

293
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:56,067
I was so miserable from being airsick.

294
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:01,823
But a flight attendant
gently rubbed my back.

295
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:05,535
That made me so happy,

296
00:20:06,077 --> 00:20:11,124
that I wanted to become like her
when I grew up.

297
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:17,214
So, this was my dream.

298
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:20,717
And I really do love my job.

299
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,346
Your dream, huh?

300
00:20:25,847 --> 00:20:26,807
That's great!

301
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:30,727
I hope I find my dream job too!

302
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,068
You know…

303
00:20:39,236 --> 00:20:40,445
Today felt

304
00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:43,615
like a real party.

305
00:20:43,698 --> 00:20:45,033
It was fun, wasn't it?

306
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:56,878
Kencho…

307
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:58,463
I've been looking for you, Akira!

308
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:01,466
Maki's after me! We gotta get out of here!

309
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:04,177
But check this out!

310
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:07,055
{\an8}A widescreen TV!

311
00:21:08,807 --> 00:21:10,016
How's this?

312
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,726
Nabbed one for you!

313
00:21:17,816 --> 00:21:19,734
That's a great find, Kencho!

314
00:21:20,277 --> 00:21:22,737
All right! The zombies went off somewhere!

315
00:21:23,363 --> 00:21:25,282
Let's split!

316
00:21:34,457 --> 00:21:38,712
And after that, Maki went
and turned into a zombie, too.

317
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:42,215
I think I've been traumatized
by flight attendants.

318
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:44,426
9. WINE AND DINE

319
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:45,510
10. COOL BEARD
11. BIG TV

320
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:01,151
I've always wanted to be one someday.

321
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:03,528
It was my dream.

322
00:22:03,612 --> 00:22:06,197
So, this was my dream.

323
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:09,534
And I really do love my job.

324
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,920
35. REMEMBER MY CHILDHOOD DREAM

325
00:22:26,843 --> 00:22:27,677
All right!

326
00:24:01,312 --> 00:24:03,815
<i>Next time, Hero of the Dead.</i>
