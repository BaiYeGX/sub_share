1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,880
I think it's coming together.

2
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:08,008
Akira, since your hair is short,

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,427
we'll start by adding extensions
for volume

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:14,306
and sew them into your natural hair
with an extension hook.

5
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:19,811
Finally, we'll secure them by weaving in
any loose strands, and you're done!

6
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,402
Starting today, I'm…

7
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,655
Farmer Dreadlocks!

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,492
5. TRY OUT DREADLOCKS

9
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,294
I see. So you worked at a specialty salon
for over ten years?

10
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,963
Yes, I was totally devoted to dreadlocks.

11
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:14,426
So when I heard that Akira wanted
dreadlocks, I just had to help him out.

12
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,179
I taught at a college in Tokyo.

13
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,307
I was a makeup artist for films.

14
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,019
Wow! Films? What did you work on?

15
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,020
Let's see.

16
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,564
{\an8}I did this one. Do you know it?

17
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:32,069
I've seen this one! It was made in Japan?

18
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,445
That's right!

19
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,489
We were filming the sequel and…

20
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:45,457
We were filming the sequel until that day.

21
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:50,253
You'd never expect to be attacked
by real zombies

22
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,257
while filming a zombie movie.

23
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,927
<i>We took too long to notice.</i>

24
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,720
<i>And so…</i>

25
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,224
Mr. Nakayama, you're so convincing!

26
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:25,080
So much happened along the way here.

27
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:31,878
But everyone in the village
welcomed us with open arms.

28
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:36,508
I can't thank them enough
for their kindness.

29
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,888
And so, though it's just
wishful thinking for now,

30
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:46,309
I'd like to continue living
in this village.

31
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,354
That's how I truly feel.

32
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,943
You're right!

33
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,622
Thanks.

34
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,584
It must be tough doing work
you're unaccustomed to.

35
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,002
Not at all.

36
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,421
The key to keeping
this village safe from zombies

37
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,175
might come from using skills
from a time without electricity.

38
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,429
I'm very interested
in how people live here.

39
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:29,394
Well, I don't really get it,
but nothing beats rice cooked on a hearth.

40
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:34,691
Add plenty of water and place it
on a roaring fire for the perfect rice.

41
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,109
I see.

42
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,071
I guess all that extra effort
makes it taste even better.

43
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,573
Very interes--

44
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,576
-Akemi!
-No!

45
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,370
Cut it out, Old Man Hiko!

46
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,041
You left me all alone!
Where have you been all this time?

47
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,002
Sorry about that.

48
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,714
He's been that way
ever since his old lady passed away.

49
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,341
I see.

50
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,803
-Akemi! Is dinner ready yet?
-He may not look it,

51
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:06,264
but he used to be
the best hunter in this village.

52
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,349
Hey, Tome.

53
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,852
Have any rope or something you can spare?

54
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:14,481
I was haying and sliced myself
with the scythe.

55
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,734
How terrible!
I'll get you some right away.

56
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:22,656
Try not to bind it too tightly
or you'll risk necrosis of the tissue.

57
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:27,619
First, raise the injury above your heart
and after applying pressure to the area,

58
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,163
then try applying pressure to the artery.

59
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,376
You seem to know a lot about this.
Are you a doctor?

60
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,294
No.

61
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:40,423
When I was little, I was interested
in medicine, so I did some reading on it.

62
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,384
What's this? A doctor?

63
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:46,263
My back has been feeling worse
than usual since this morning.

64
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,597
Like I said--

65
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,891
What a young and beautiful doctor!

66
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:52,394
I stumbled and hurt my knee.

67
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,145
My stomach isn't feeling good.

68
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,398
-I can't control my bladder.
-I'm constipated.

69
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,900
Akemi!

70
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,485
No!

71
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,822
-I heard she's a doctor.
-How wonderful.

72
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,908
Is that what I think it is?

73
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,077
Is this a cesspit?

74
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,038
You don't see them
being used much nowadays,

75
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:14,416
but it's a great source
for natural fertilizer.

76
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,543
Fertilizer?

77
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,547
In Japan, the rain washes away
a lot of the minerals from our fields.

78
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,634
But if we recycle the food that we eat
by returning it to the soil,

79
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:27,304
we can replenish those minerals.

80
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,139
I see.

81
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,643
They say a dive in the cesspit
will get you ahead in life.

82
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,312
Want to give it a try, young man?

83
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:39,649
Who is that girl?

84
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,737
She escaped from the city.

85
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:50,452
She lost her parents and that dog
is the only family she has left.

86
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,997
I haven't seen her smile once
since she got here.

87
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,833
Such a young girl. Poor thing.

88
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,004
Hey there, beautiful lady.

89
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,134
I'm trying to become a comedian,
so I'm practicing my juggling.

90
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,720
Would you care to watch?

91
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,350
Why are you using <i>daruma?</i>

92
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,811
Why? Because Gunma is known
for their <i>daruma.</i>

93
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:19,397
Once I've perfected this,
I want to perform it naked.

94
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:22,859
I'll be juggling so fast that
you won't see my crotch. So don't worry!

95
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,114
Are you into little girls or something?

96
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,201
Why are you even talking to me?

97
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:34,871
It's common courtesy
to say hello to a lady,

98
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,124
whether they're a girl or an old woman.

99
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:39,876
Courtesy?

100
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,919
That's right!

101
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:44,255
In Italy, you never forget
to smile at women,

102
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,175
and it's considered rude
if you don't compliment women.

103
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,850
You're so strange, Mister.
You're not even Italian.

104
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,436
Looks like I finally got you to smile.

105
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:04,651
I'm Kencho!
What's your name, beautiful lady?

106
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,530
Anju. And this is Charo.

107
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,032
Then I'll call you Angie!

108
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,707
Hey, could you watch me practice
my other acts?

109
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,875
There's one where I eat udon with my butt!

110
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,544
-I'll pass.
-What?

111
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:24,796
<i>Wunderbar!</i>

112
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,257
What a magnificent water wheel!

113
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,300
It's one of those hydroelectric ones.

114
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,179
It produces the minimum amount
of electricity we need.

115
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,640
Renewable energy.

116
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:38,560
It's perfect for Nippon
with its abundant sources of water!

117
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,815
Zombie bears and zombie boars
have been showing up in this area,

118
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,651
so we've fortified our electrical fence
to keep them out.

119
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,279
That's also powered by this.

120
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,655
I see.

121
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,452
That said, this only gives you
a small shock if you touch it.

122
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,328
By the way…

123
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:02,417
Bea, make sure you don't touch this.

124
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,086
-What is it?
-It's an earth-leakage circuit breaker.

125
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,340
It shuts off the power
if there's an electric leak

126
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,093
from the voltage
being cranked up too high.

127
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,013
It's dangerous, so you mustn't touch it.

128
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,182
<i>Ja!</i> Understood!

129
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,351
Since living in this village,

130
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:24,230
I've started thinking
about connections between people.

131
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,984
Doing anything here takes time.

132
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,737
<i>You can't survive</i>
<i>unless you help one another</i>

133
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,447
<i>because things aren't convenient.</i>

134
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,823
<i>It helps connect people.</i>

135
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,078
<i>Here, you can see the work</i>
<i>that needs to be done,</i>

136
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,538
<i>and you see the people who do it.</i>

137
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:44,918
Unlike in the city,
things are limited here.

138
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:50,673
Because they are limited, I'm thankful
and happy for whatever I can get.

139
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,968
That's kinda what it feels like!

140
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,600
Hey, Akira!

141
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,728
-Good job!
-Kencho!

142
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,232
-You've been working the fields all day?
-Yeah. What about you?

143
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,608
I slaughtered a chicken!

144
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,361
I may never eat chicken again
because of the trauma.

145
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,737
I know, right?

146
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,366
Isn't that guy…

147
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,409
Higurashi?

148
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,579
Hey, Higurashi!

149
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,665
You're still alive too?

150
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,625
It's me! Ryuzaki!

151
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,377
It's been a while.

152
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,635
What? He left.

153
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,304
-Who's Higurashi?
-Don't you remember?

154
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,683
He was in our general education classes
at K University.

155
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,352
He stopped showing up
after about six months

156
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,313
Heard a rumor he became a NEET.

157
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,525
Didn't expect to run into him here.

158
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,906
Of all the damn people to run into…

159
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:02,704
Damn it.

160
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,083
It's been a while
since I've seen their annoying faces.

161
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,920
They always looked like they were
having so much fun by themselves.

162
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,679
Perfect. This is perfect.

163
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,647
Hey, Dad!

164
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,444
You wanna have a drink together?

165
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,739
Sure. Don't see why not.

166
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,953
<i>What better way to give back to your dad</i>
<i>than sharing a drink together!</i>

167
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,498
<i>Hold on.</i>

168
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,710
<i>Have Dad's hands always been so thin?</i>

169
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:55,131
<i>Looking closely, he's gotten more grey.</i>

170
00:11:56,174 --> 00:12:01,763
<i>After not seeing him for a while,</i>
<i>seems like he got smaller too.</i>

171
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,852
Hey, Dad.

172
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:09,771
What is it?

173
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,024
After coming back to the village,
I've been thinking…

174
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:20,239
When I was a kid, I idolized the big city,
but living here is not that bad.

175
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:25,119
Besides, it must be tough
working that big field all by yourself.

176
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:28,081
I'm sure Mom could use the extra help too.

177
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,334
So I…

178
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,713
What's the point in staying cooped up
in this small village?

179
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,761
A man follows his dream,
the biggest one he can dream of.

180
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,390
What the hell?

181
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,976
I was trying to repay you both.

182
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,231
You talk big,
but you're just a country farmer…

183
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,660
What was your dream as a kid?

184
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,124
Akira,

185
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:16,295
haven't you ever wanted to see Earth
from the far reaches of space?

186
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,047
Space?

187
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:26,222
Apparently, seeing our planet
from outer space is shocking to people.

188
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:32,520
<i>Once you leave school and become an adult,</i>
<i>you realize how small your world was.</i>

189
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:36,232
<i>Same as how you left</i>
<i>the village for Tokyo.</i>

190
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,526
<i>It made you realize</i>
<i>how small your world was.</i>

191
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,446
<i>Looking at the world from space,</i>

192
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,782
<i>you don't see the equator line</i>
<i>or the lines that divide countries.</i>

193
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,537
<i>You see how tiny your existence is</i>
<i>and that moves you.</i>

194
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,207
<i>Your existence on a tiny planet,</i>
<i>in the vastness of space…</i>

195
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,918
To tell you the truth,

196
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:01,424
ever since I was a kid,
I've wanted to be an astronaut!

197
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,677
What?

198
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:10,933
Well, I'm just too dumb, so there's no way
that will happen at this point!

199
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,191
What the hell?

200
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,944
I had no idea you were such a joker!

201
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,572
Yeah.

202
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,910
Compared to 13.8 billion years
in the history of space,

203
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,580
eighty years of life
isn't even a tenth of a second.

204
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,708
So don't sell yourself short.

205
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,546
Find your dream, Akira.
Biggest one you can.

206
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:44,842
A man without a dream
is nothing more than a jellyfish.

207
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,557
By the way Akira, not that it matters,

208
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,353
but that hair doesn't look good
on you at all.

209
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,105
Shut up!

210
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,108
I wanted them!

211
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,408
31. GO HOME AND SPEND TIME WITH MY PARENTS

212
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,142
Sorry to keep you zombies waiting.

213
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,114
Are you ready?

214
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,782
-Yes.
-Yeah.

215
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,452
The plan is simple.

216
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,494
35. F*CK UP SOCIETY

217
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,540
Turn everyone in the village
into zombie food!

218
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,002
Might as well get revenge
on those normies too.

219
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,796
Just you wait, Akira.

220
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,975
Hey, how many times
do I have to remind you?

221
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,393
That's not a bathroom…

222
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,522
What is it?

223
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,608
Over there.

224
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,162
What's the matter, Shizuka?

225
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,667
-Dad.
-Yeah.

226
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,550
What the hell is going on here?

227
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:03,940
Akira!

228
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,318
Leave your mother to me
and go to your friends.

229
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:09,153
What? Dad?!

230
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,157
Your friends have supported you
all the way here, right?

231
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,408
Keep them safe.

232
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,712
They're running so fast!
This is hilarious!

233
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,714
Get the sick ones inside first!

234
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,592
Lock the door and barricade it
the best you can!

235
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,977
Are you all right, Shizuka?

236
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,479
Yes.

237
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,857
Hunting Club! Forward!

238
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,693
Fire!

239
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:55,741
It's no good!

240
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,743
-There are too many!
-Let's fall back.

241
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:58,911
This way!

242
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,373
What's this? Going home already?

243
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,625
The night is still young, you know.

244
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:08,379
Let's play outside a little longer.

245
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,093
5. BLOW SOMETHING UP WITH DYNAMITE

246
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,348
3. FIRE A REAL GUN

247
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,309
This is so horrible.

248
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,769
I have to do something.

249
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,981
If this keeps up,
the village will be destroyed.

250
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,494
Thanks for the save, Bea!

251
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,747
No problem!

252
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,333
-Kencho!
-Beatrix!

253
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,836
Thank goodness! You're all okay!

254
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,463
We'll talk later!

255
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,049
We must get everyone
in the village out of here now.

256
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,967
Get everyone to the suspension bridge!

257
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:57,470
But there's an electric fence
around the village.

258
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,849
It's just meant to deter zombie boars,
so the voltage shouldn't be dangerous.

259
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,226
Really?

260
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,272
He's getting shocked pretty badly!

261
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,483
To save someone from electrocution,

262
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,985
we need a non-conductive material
like wood

263
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,780
to knock them away!

264
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,490
I knew you could do it, Shizuka!

265
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,158
That was a close one.

266
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,828
But why is the voltage so high?

267
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,997
Could it be?

268
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:26,832
Did someone increase the voltage

269
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,251
and disable
the earth-leakage circuit breaker?

270
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:30,544
Hold on a second!

271
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,798
So then the same electric fence
that protects the village

272
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,926
from zombies is trapping us in?

273
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,429
Hey!

274
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:44,725
Akira! Ryuzaki!

275
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,813
As expected, you guys sure are persistent!

276
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,731
Higurashi?

277
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,528
Hey! There are zombies behind you!

278
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,446
Hey, they're coming!

279
00:19:58,572 --> 00:19:59,782
That guy is an idiot.

280
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,201
I can't believe
he still hasn't figured it out.

281
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,788
No way.

282
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,709
You guys did this?

283
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,714
That's correct!

284
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,426
Why in the world would you do this?

285
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,683
Well, we're all gonna be zombies one day.

286
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:30,980
It'd be a shame if I didn't get to do
what I wanted before, right?

287
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:32,815
That notebook…

288
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:37,528
What? Were you making a list too?

289
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,238
35. F*CK UP SOCIETY

290
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,656
What a coincidence!

291
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,119
What should I do next?

292
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,455
Yeah, gotta be this one.

293
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:53,377
Akira, I'd love to see you become
a zombie with my own eyes.

294
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,590
Screw you!
What did Akira do to you anyway?

295
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:03,637
I've hated you
since the moment we met in college.

296
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,224
<i>You didn't have a care in the world.</i>

297
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:11,187
Enjoying life, each and every day.

298
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,273
I couldn't help but be disgusted.

299
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,275
That's your reason?

300
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,737
This is our last summer break ever.

301
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,282
What's wrong with enjoying it
like you guys?

302
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,410
-You bastard.
-You only live once.

303
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:29,705
So enjoy life the way you want to.

304
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,542
I get it because I'm doing that too.

305
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,254
Akira, what are you say--

306
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:43,427
If you're gonna put your freedom first,
you need to respect others' freedoms too.

307
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:47,556
Stealing freedom from the villagers
who are struggling to survive…

308
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,433
That's what you want to do?

309
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,687
I seriously don't understand
what you're saying.

310
00:21:56,524 --> 00:22:00,820
{\an8}Our bucket lists are nothing alike!

311
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,284
I still haven't repaid my parents
for raising me.

312
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,914
{\an8}If I have to live with the regret
of not giving back to my parents,

313
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,042
{\an8}I'd rather be eaten by zombies!

314
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,460
{\an8}Nice.

315
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,045
{\an8}That's what I want to hear!

316
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:24,343
{\an8}It'll be a competition between you and me
to see who finishes their list first.

317
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,975
{\an8}Akira, we'll be surrounded
by zombies at this rate!

318
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,977
{\an8}It's frustrating, but we must retreat!

319
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,729
{\an8}We need to evacuate
everyone in the village!

320
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:36,981
{\an8}Charo?

321
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,524
{\an8}I'll go to the water wheel shed!

322
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,193
{\an8}I'll shut the generator
powering the electrical fence!

323
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,654
{\an8}Then I'm going to give back to my parents!

324
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:47,491
{\an8}Your goal seems to be different
from everyone else, but whatever.

325
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,368
{\an8}We need to get everyone else.

326
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:52,746
{\an8}Once the fence shuts off,
let's meet at the mountain bridge.

327
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,747
Okay!

328
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:56,208
Angie, don't leave my side, okay?

329
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:57,960
Angie!

330
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,212
Kencho! Over there!

331
00:23:00,838 --> 00:23:02,214
{\an8}What is she doing over there?

332
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,133
{\an8}Leave her to me!

333
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,385
{\an8}You go to your mom!

334
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,053
{\an8}But…

335
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,641
{\an8}We're definitely going to make it out
of this alive.

336
00:23:15,686 --> 00:23:16,854
{\an8}Yeah!

337
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,108
{\an8}Is she going to stop the water wheel?

338
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,901
Not on my watch!

339
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,405
Go have fun, however you want.

340
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,910
Let's drag out the villagers
hiding in their homes

341
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,414
and turn every last one of them
into zombie food.

342
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:38,667
A game of tag and then hide-and-seek.

343
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:41,754
That's a pretty good start
to summer break!

344
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:49,720
<i>Next Time: Hometown of the Dead II.</i>
