1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:03,462
A college in Tokyo?

2
00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,798
That's fine and all,
but why do you want to go there?

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,427
A production company?

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,889
Is that really the kind of work
you want to do?

5
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:18,852
Find your dream, Akira.
Biggest one you can.

6
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:23,523
A man without a dream
is nothing more than a jellyfish.

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,859
<i>Like you know anything.</i>

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,445
<i>You're just…</i>

9
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,073
<i>a country farmer.</i>

10
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,876
Man! We're almost at Akira's hometown!

11
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,545
I sure hope your parents are all right.

12
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,796
They'll be fine!

13
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,382
My parents wouldn't go down that easily!

14
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,927
As your best friend,
I have to introduce myself to them!

15
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,138
I'll entertain them with a one-liner!

16
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,141
I'll draw them in by getting naked.

17
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,686
It's been three years
since you visited your parents, right?

18
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,522
You're not nervous, are you?

19
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,775
No! Not at all!

20
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,363
<i>Well, honestly,</i>
<i>it's gonna be kind of awkward.</i>

21
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,326
<i>Now that I've quit my job, I don't know</i>
<i>what I'm gonna say when I see him.</i>

22
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,243
Akira!

23
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,460
What's going on?

24
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:50,837
I'll go check it out!

25
00:02:58,512 --> 00:02:59,846
Zombies.

26
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,433
Your village is past this tunnel, right?

27
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,103
-You don't think…
-The villagers have…?

28
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:11,775
No. I don't recognize anyone in there.

29
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,284
Anyway, since we can't
get through the tunnel,

30
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,370
there's only one other way to continue.

31
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,957
We'll cut through the forest,
and go over the mountain.

32
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,886
Don't worry.

33
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,641
<i>The entrance and exit of the tunnel</i>
<i>were sealed.</i>

34
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,938
They probably managed to seal out
the zombies who came from the cities.

35
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,858
I'm sure the villagers are safe.

36
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,654
-A scream?
-Where is it coming from?

37
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,658
Out of the way!

38
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,285
A zombie boar?

39
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,202
Please get down!

40
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,705
<i>Oshite mairu!</i>

41
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,048
Are you all right?

42
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,887
Man, you really did me a solid back there!

43
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,307
My name is Masaru Kumano!
Nice to meet you!

44
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,854
Mr. Kumano, what are you doing
so deep in the forest?

45
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:34,608
What am I doing? The cities are overrun
with monsters, aren't they?

46
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:38,487
I was looking for a safe place
and ended up settling here!

47
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,114
That monster boar was unexpected, though!

48
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,910
Home is where you make it! I understand!

49
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,246
But you can't live
in the middle of the forest!

50
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,002
This is…

51
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,212
Could it be?

52
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,839
It's a treehouse, of course!

53
00:04:57,923 --> 00:05:01,092
Despite how things seem,
I'm a master carpenter!

54
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,804
No house?
No problem, I can just build one!

55
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,265
Based on how things have been going…

56
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,391
23. BUILD A TREEHOUSE

57
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,976
<i>Japanischer Tischler!</i>

58
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,145
This is an oak tree!

59
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:17,734
Oaks have large, thick branches
so they make perfect host trees.

60
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,736
Southern trees rot too easily!

61
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,864
But you can find
some northern trees in this area!

62
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,699
This is an amazing and rare forest

63
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,118
that's quite unusual
from a global perspective!

64
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:31,331
Mr. Kumano, another zombie boar
might attack before it's completed.

65
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,668
This is a race against time.
It'd be better if you had help, right?

66
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,503
Well, sure…

67
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,965
Aren't we racing against time
to see if your parents are safe?

68
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,343
I can't believe
you'd ignore someone in danger!

69
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,595
Have some heart, Shizuka!

70
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,975
Your own secret base where you can stretch
your wings and leave the world down below!

71
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,768
A building at one with nature,

72
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,145
where you can embrace
the power of the trees!

73
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:56,022
No limit to what you can design!

74
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,400
A treasure trove of imagination
and playfulness!

75
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,694
A dreamhouse suspended in mid-air!

76
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,153
A treehouse!

77
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:07,492
Can we?! We only live once.
Can we build a treehouse with our hands?

78
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,119
I think that's a great idea.

79
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,957
I don't understand what's going on,
but I'll be counting on you!

80
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,337
{\an8}ENTRUST - AFFECTION - REVEAL

81
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,131
Affection. Sympathy.

82
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,258
Honestly, why are men always so…

83
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,384
I did it!

84
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,803
A hose?

85
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,640
It's difficult to judge how level
things are between trees by eyeballing it.

86
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,852
You measure it by checking
the level of a hose filled with water!

87
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,271
Amazing!

88
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,106
I see. You're right!

89
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,443
Eyeballing it, I thought it was level,
but I was completely off!

90
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,821
If you place your nails and bolts
in the right locations,

91
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,489
you won't damage the tree.

92
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,366
-I see!
-I see!

93
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,869
It's best to leave a five cm gap
between boards,

94
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,996
so fallen leaves won't get stuck in them!

95
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,122
-I see!
-I see!

96
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:58,126
Treehouses are built differently
from tree to tree.

97
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:01,463
The tree itself
will tell you how to build it,

98
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,131
and what kind of house it'll be.

99
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:07,010
If you're not sure of something,
ask the forest.

100
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:07,969
The forest?

101
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:09,930
That's right!

102
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,350
The foundation of a treehouse
is the tree itself.

103
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,353
If the host tree dies,
the house is done for.

104
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,441
When you think of a tree, think about
the other trees and the earth around it.

105
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:26,279
By doing that, you'll become mindful
of the entire forest.

106
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,533
And that's how you'll hear
the voice of the forest.

107
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:42,587
<i>I feel like I just learned something</i>
<i>really profound.</i>

108
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:48,301
<i>When you think of a tree, think about</i>
<i>the other trees and the earth around it.</i>

109
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:52,055
<i>By doing that, you'll become mindful</i>
<i>of the entire forest.</i>

110
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:56,059
<i>And that's how you'll hear</i>
<i>the voice of the forest?</i>

111
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,188
<i>Does that mean…</i>

112
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,776
<i>if you think of yourself</i>
<i>and others around you,</i>

113
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,446
<i>you'll become mindful of the whole world?</i>

114
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,451
<i>So, when the day comes when I can hear</i>
<i>the voice of the world…</i>

115
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,623
<i>What will I write in my bucket list then?</i>

116
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,087
You know,
you've got quite a knack for this!

117
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,840
What? Really? Thank you very much!

118
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,552
I've always dreamed of having
a treehouse since I was little.

119
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,346
That's great to hear!

120
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:34,764
Come to think of it,

121
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:39,102
my son used to pester me to build
a treehouse for him when he was a kid.

122
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,020
I see!

123
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:42,105
Where is your son right now?

124
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,194
Mr. Kumano?

125
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:53,616
My son was bitten by my wife
right before my eyes.

126
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,579
So, I had to deal with them
with my own hands.

127
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,081
I thought I could take my time

128
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:05,378
and build a tree house with my son
when he was bigger and I had retired.

129
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:10,258
People say when you're ready to repay
your parent, it's already too late.

130
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,637
Turns out,
it works the other way around too.

131
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,891
Sorry.

132
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,900
You have my support.
Let's finish this together.

133
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,278
Thank you.

134
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,491
All right! Just a little more
until it's complete!

135
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,534
Let's give it our all!

136
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:46,753
The treehouse is complete!

137
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,173
This is the best house ever!

138
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,343
This canned food is very delicious!

139
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,929
It was the right call
to grab these from the store!

140
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,931
23. BUILD A TREEHOUSE

141
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,434
Mr. Kumano,
it's been great working with you.

142
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,020
I'll be in the forest.

143
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:07,107
If there's trouble, give me a holler,
and I'll give you a hand.

144
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,191
Okay!

145
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,068
How unusual.

146
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,571
I thought you would say,
"I got to spend the night in a treehouse."

147
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,572
Yeah, well…

148
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,747
I kinda got a strong urge
to see my mom and dad.

149
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,174
That was close!

150
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:36,344
Aren't there any other routes
we can take, Akira?

151
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,972
This place used to be called
the "Hungry Gorge"

152
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,807
because of how many people died here.

153
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,770
Until they opened the tunnel, this was
the route to and from the village!

154
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,524
They also say my village started out
as a penal colony.

155
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,778
Enclosed by steep mountains and valleys,
it's like a remote island on land!

156
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:55,780
Hey!

157
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,241
We somehow managed to cross it.

158
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,703
You sure grew up in a pretty wild place.

159
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,872
Would you believe
I was a wild child myself?

160
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:04,956
Yeah, I believe it.

161
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,084
But thanks to all this…

162
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,463
It's very likely that everyone
in the village is still safe!

163
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,466
We're here.

164
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,595
That's my home,
where I was born and raised!

165
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:27,896
<i>Have I given anything back to my parents</i>
<i>since becoming an adult?</i>

166
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,941
<i>Their birthdays and my first paycheck…</i>

167
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,485
<i>I had plenty of opportunities,</i>

168
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,822
<i>but I never really thought about it</i>
<i>until now.</i>

169
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,867
Dad… Mom…

170
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,245
I'll be home soon!

171
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,756
No way.

172
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,759
Where's everyone from the village?!

173
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:00,720
Dad. Mom!

174
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,347
Akira!

175
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,517
<i>This can't be happening.</i>
<i>This can't be happening, right?!</i>

176
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:10,271
<i>Please! I'm begging you! Please be safe!</i>

177
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,941
Dad! Mom!

178
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,529
Drink! Dance!

179
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:27,830
What's this?

180
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,042
Aren't you Akira, Tendo's kid?

181
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:35,129
Teruo! Akiko! Akira has come back!

182
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,047
What?

183
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,424
Akira? Akira, is that you?

184
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,181
Dad…

185
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,734
Dad! Thanks for working hard
everyday, non-stop,

186
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,363
to put me through college!

187
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:06,828
Mom! Thanks for packing me lunch everyday
and washing my rugby club uniforms!

188
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,707
I wouldn't be alive today
if it weren't for the both of you!

189
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,210
I've just given you nothing
but troubles and worries.

190
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:15,878
And…

191
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,048
I've never done anything for you!

192
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:23,344
I used work as an excuse to not visit you
for the past three years.

193
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,347
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry--

194
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,063
That hurts! What was that for?

195
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:38,234
You return just to spill that nonsense?

196
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:43,239
The world's a mess.
Think a little before you act.

197
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,283
Nonsense?

198
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,743
Are you all Akira's friends?

199
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,620
You must've had a tough time
crossing that dangerous path.

200
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:53,041
We've got plenty of empty rooms,
so get some rest for now.

201
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:56,252
-Yes, sir! Thank you!
-Thank you very much!

202
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,048
I leave the rest to you, dear.

203
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:02,091
I'm off to the fields.

204
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,763
Your dad's not the man I'd pictured.

205
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:11,309
-All right, we should get to work too!
-All right!

206
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,938
We forage wild plants in the
mountains and vegetables from our fields.

207
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:19,776
We're a small village with nothing fancy,
but please make yourself at home.

208
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,111
Thank you very much, ma'am!

209
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:23,821
Thanks for the food!

210
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:27,325
Wow! This is so good!

211
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,327
So this is tempura?

212
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,498
Have you been locked down here
sustaining yourselves

213
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,957
all this time in the village?

214
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,752
Yes, we're a remote village

215
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,339
that's pretty much sealed off
every winter, anyway, with all the snow.

216
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:46,552
<i>We've always survived the winter</i>
<i>by farming and hunting.</i>

217
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,138
<i>So, this spot of trouble</i>
<i>isn't trouble at all.</i>

218
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,223
<i>I see.</i>

219
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,642
If I may ask…

220
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,727
The zombies in the tunnel…

221
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,897
A lot of people from the city
tried to take shelter here

222
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,401
when they heard rumors
that this village was safe.

223
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:07,240
<i>But some of them were infected,</i>
<i>and they were spreading the infection.</i>

224
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,245
<i>We had no choice but to seal the tunnel.</i>

225
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,997
<i>That stopped the infection in its tracks.</i>

226
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:19,252
I'm really glad
you and the others are safe!

227
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:23,756
Anyway, a number of people from the city
managed to survive.

228
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:28,136
<i>The village has been losing residents</i>
<i>for a bit, so there are many empty houses.</i>

229
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:32,515
<i>We let them use those and live with us.</i>

230
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,142
<i>Wunderbar!</i>

231
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,476
Akira!

232
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,563
We should add historic home renovations
on your list!

233
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,648
That's a good one!

234
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,899
<i>Hold on now!</i>

235
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,652
<i>There was a reason why I came back</i>
<i>to my parents' place!</i>

236
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,030
<i>I haven't repaid Mom and Dad!</i>

237
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:49,657
<i>I have to be a good son!</i>

238
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,909
31. GO HOME AND SPEND TIME WITH MY PARENTS

239
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,163
This is truly a glimpse of old Japan.

240
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,376
I wasn't even born here, but I feel like
I've returned to my hometown.

241
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,086
What's this feeling of nostalgia?

242
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,171
-Right?
-Right?

243
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:05,173
You don't need to do that!

244
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,926
I'll wash the dishes for you.
You can just sit back.

245
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,052
Really?

246
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,932
Anyway, look, I got you a souvenir!
It's Biyoko Tweats, a Tokyo specialty!

247
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,767
Thank you.

248
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,187
Are you tired?
Want me to massage your shoulders?

249
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,229
I'm all right.

250
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,357
Then how about I take you on a trip?
How about a hot spring?

251
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:26,611
I found a really amazing spring
in the mountains recently.

252
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,907
Akira, thanks for worrying about me.

253
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,868
But aren't you exhausted
from your long journey?

254
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,455
I can do the dishes myself,
so get some rest.

255
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,542
Hey, Akira.

256
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,129
I could use your help if you're free.

257
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,725
How have you been lately?

258
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,560
Have your backaches gone away?

259
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:02,605
No. It's the same as always.

260
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,608
Dad, you've really been doing this
by yourself?

261
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,527
Working the fields sure is hard work!

262
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,112
It's not that bad.

263
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,449
But now that I'm here,
I can help you with anything!

264
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,742
You can count on me for--

265
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,704
Everyone in the village
must work together to do their part.

266
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,414
Everyone knows that.

267
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,876
That's true.

268
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:33,594
<i>I'm having trouble</i>
<i>making Mom and Dad happy.</i>

269
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,641
This is so difficult!

270
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:45,314
How do you repay your parents?

271
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:55,241
I don't expect I've got much time left.

272
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,409
Dad!

273
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,162
The green beans were ready to harvest.
This should be enough for dinner.

274
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,958
Dad?

275
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,086
-Is something--
-No. It's nothing.

276
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,945
I see. Those guys came from the city.

277
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,948
That guy… I've seen him before.

278
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,126
-Are we really doing this?
-Of course we are.

279
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:55,426
JOB SEARCH

280
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,680
Just 230,000 yen
for contract work? And no bonus?

281
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,770
Do they think I'm stupid?

282
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,106
I guess working really is for losers.

283
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,233
Damn it!

284
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:15,154
I should've had that old lady get me more.

285
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,448
What a pain!

286
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:24,622
<i>When and why did I start falling behind</i>
<i>those around me?</i>

287
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:30,461
<i>A life of being unwanted</i>
<i>by society and by others.</i>

288
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,341
<i>I wish I could go back to summer break</i>

289
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,136
<i>in grade school when I didn't have</i>
<i>to think about anything</i>

290
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:44,892
<i>and I could go to the pool with my friends</i>
<i>every day and do whatever I wanted.</i>

291
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,772
Help me!

292
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,526
Stop it!

293
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,284
<i>What the hell is that?</i>

294
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,300
Yes!

295
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,094
I'm free!

296
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:24,932
<i>I was unwanted by those guys and society!</i>

297
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,977
<i>And they've all…</i>
<i>They've all been destroyed!</i>

298
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,398
From now on, it's summer break every day!

299
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:24,158
{\an8}Going to the public pool by yourself
during summer break is pretty lame.

300
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,494
Hey, you three.

301
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,790
Do you wanna have some fun together?

302
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,878
TRY OUT DRUGS

303
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,756
Fire a real gun…

304
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,467
Blow something up with dynamite.

305
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,386
Burn down the company that insulted me.

306
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,015
I wanna force my tongue
down a girl's throat!

307
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,893
Slap my bitch of a wife!

308
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:58,192
<i>We've all been rejected by society.</i>

309
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,862
<i>It's our turn to have fun</i>
<i>and do whatever we want.</i>

310
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:04,949
<i>Our last summer break!</i>

311
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:12,790
We're all just waiting to become zombies.

312
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:16,043
{\an8}But while we're waiting…

313
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,089
{\an8}might as well do what we want.

314
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:21,966
{\an8}It'd be a shame not to.

315
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,845
<i>Next time: Hometown of the Dead I.</i>
