00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:07,424
{\an8}<i>When I was in elementary school,</i>
<i>I had friends just like everyone else.</i>

2
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:08,967
GROUNDS
PUBLIC POOL

3
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:14,473
<i>During summer break, we'd play</i>
<i>at the public pool every day until sunset.</i>

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:19,686
<i>Thinking back on it,</i>
<i>my life peaked back then.</i>

5
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:25,442
<i>When I got to middle school,</i>

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,071
<i>everyone began to notice</i>
<i>I was naturally an introvert.</i>

7
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:32,449
<i>Before I knew it,</i>
<i>I was on the outside looking in.</i>

8
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:38,247
<i>During my three years in high school,</i>
<i>I didn't talk to anyone</i>

9
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,291
<i>and spent my time reading</i>
<i>while listening to Rakugo stories.</i>

10
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,878
<i>In college, I tried to change myself.</i>

11
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,213
<i>I did an overseas internship.</i>

12
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,714
<i>I was a student volunteer.</i>

13
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:51,093
<i>And I even took</i>
<i>a personal development seminar.</i>

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:57,224
<i>But to everyone else, I was just an empty,</i>
<i>visionless, self-conscious idiot.</i>

15
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,017
<i>To be fair, I didn't know</i>

16
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:02,813
<i>-what I wanted to do with myself.</i>
-They'll upsize beef bowls for free!

17
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,982
What? For real?

18
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,067
We have to go! I could eat three bowls!

19
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,987
You're definitely going
to barf them up during practice.

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:13,198
It's fine! I'll be fine this time!

21
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,617
Didn't you say something like that before?

22
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:18,745
-That was five servings of pasta.
<i>-He should have been like me.</i>

23
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:22,249
<i>-Empty, visionless, lacking ambition.</i>
-No way. That would be six bowls!

24
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,792
<i>-But he…</i>
-Nope, I can do it today!

25
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:28,213
<i>…cruised through life</i>
<i>without a care in the world.</i>

26
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,132
<i>He's always enjoying himself!</i>

27
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,012
<i>And I just couldn't help but despise him.</i>

28
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:37,514
What's the matter?

29
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,766
Come on out already.

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,896
Your dad is weeping
over what a good son he has!

31
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,274
<i>I have to save Dad!</i>

32
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,110
<i>But that means I need to become a zombie?</i>

33
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:51,987
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

34
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,949
Don't you dare open that door, Akira.

35
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:04,166
If you put your mom in danger
and make me watch my own kid die,

36
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:09,046
we're no longer family.

37
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,215
But if I don't do anything,
you're going to…

38
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,677
Don't worry about me, Akira.

39
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:20,265
Either way, I don't have long left.

40
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,685
What?

41
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,106
Your father has got one of those
bad growths on his body.

42
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,318
With everything that's happening,
there are no doctors or medicine…

43
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,944
There's no way to treat it.

44
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,614
Sooner or later,
it'll be too late for him.

45
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,783
But you don't know that for sure.

46
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,370
If we search for a doctor,
we might find one right away.

47
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:45,791
And a vaccine to deal with the zombies
could be developed tomorrow!

48
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,253
At this rate, I'll never
have a chance to show you my gratitude.

49
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,631
Akira,

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,259
help humanity.

51
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,055
Do what you can for the world.

52
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,392
Don't lie for your own sake.

53
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,937
Show others empathy.

54
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,983
You can give back to us,
even if we're gone.

55
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:18,198
To see you living strong
from up in heaven…

56
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:23,078
There's nothing
that would make me prouder.

57
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:31,420
<i>Haven't you ever wanted to see Earth</i>
<i>from the far reaches of space?</i>

58
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:33,922
<i>Take care of your mom.</i>

59
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,257
<i>Thanks for worrying about me.</i>

60
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,634
<i>But aren't you exhausted</i>
<i>from your long journey?</i>

61
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,720
<i>I was a makeup artist for films.</i>

62
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,305
<i>You'd never expect to be attacked</i>
<i>by real zombies.</i>

63
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:52,649
It doesn't seem like he's coming out.

64
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:58,280
I guess some half-dead old guy
isn't much of a hostage.

65
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,732
You damned fool!

66
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,567
I did it!

67
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,985
Finally!

68
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:41,740
I turned the person I hate the most
into a zombie!

69
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,868
Look at you!

70
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,623
Now I'll never have to see
that dumbass smile of yours again!

71
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:55,504
The fun times are over for you,
and you can't do what you want anymore!

72
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,714
I win!

73
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,221
{\an8}100 THINGS WE WANT TO DO
BEFORE BECOMING ZOMBIES

74
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,142
What?

75
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,770
What is this?

76
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:18,610
What the hell is going on?

77
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:20,779
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:25,492
This is a risky plan, but I'd like to ask
everyone for their help.

79
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:32,290
We'll create dark recesses for your eyes,
hollow out your cheeks, make some bruises…

80
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:36,253
For the blood, we'll make it sticky
by adding laundry detergent.

81
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,506
For discolored teeth,
we'll use brown alcohol based ink.

82
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,175
Finally, we'll give you white contacts!

83
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,889
I totally look like a zombie!

84
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:49,015
22. ATTEMPT COSPLAY

85
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,783
It's all up to you, Akira!

86
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,451
I got this!

87
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,873
Are you all right, Dad?

88
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,794
Yeah. I can still move.

89
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,797
Damn it!

90
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,049
Damn it!

91
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:29,431
Higurashi, what did you
want to do, anyway?

92
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,266
The same thing as you!

93
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,352
{\an8}To do whatever I wanted!
Anything I wanted!

94
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:38,064
{\an8}Is it so wrong for me
to have some fun for once?

95
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:43,612
If this is really what you wanted to do…

96
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,950
then why didn't you look like
you were having any fun?

97
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,080
Of course I'm having fun!

98
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,707
This is exactly what I…

99
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,169
<i>wanted to do?</i>

100
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,963
Higurashi. Higurashi!

101
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:02,964
What is it?

102
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:09,971
What the hell have you done?

103
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,975
Damn it!

104
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,978
Damn it!

105
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,065
God damn it all!

106
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,235
Let's go, Akira.

107
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,237
The zombies are already coming this way.

108
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,874
What's on your real list?

109
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:43,797
What did you want to write down
on your real bucket list, Higurashi?

110
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,762
The thing I really wanted to do…

111
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,349
Whoa! Watch out for the water!

112
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,227
That was a huge dive.

113
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,395
I lost.

114
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,813
All right!

115
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,278
You went overboard, Higurashi!

116
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:20,458
All I wanted to do…

117
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:27,424
was have fun
at the public pool with my friends.

118
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,180
If that's all, then,
you were a fool, Higurashi.

119
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:39,686
Nope, I can do it today!
It's because I didn't have breakfast yet!

120
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,659
You're in the same Gen-Ed program
as me, aren't you?

121
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,870
If you're hungry, want to come with us?

122
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,919
What's with that guy?
He left without saying anything.

123
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,213
Let's get going already.
They might run out!

124
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,010
<i>You should have just told us…</i>

125
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,806
what you wanted back then.

126
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:24,230
If the time comes
when I really become a zombie,

127
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,276
let's go to the pool together, okay?

128
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,912
25. GIVE FREE HUGS

129
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,558
Let's go.

130
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,074
GROUNDS
PUBLIC POOL

131
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,069
Hey!

132
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,655
Akiko and everyone! Are you all right?

133
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,700
Is that you, Kencho?

134
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,536
Akira! Why are you a zombie?

135
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,912
Something stinks!

136
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,706
Everyone! You're all right!

137
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,750
This is everyone from the village.

138
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,212
This is bad.

139
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,922
We need to get out of here now!

140
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,675
But how can we get past this fence?

141
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:19,345
Everyone! Out of the way please!

142
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,723
Bea?

143
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:26,477
I can't seem to get down, so I must
crash this into the electrical fence!

144
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,982
Everyone! Get away from the fence
and open up a path!

145
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,193
All healthy bodies,
give the old folks a hand!

146
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,111
Leave it to us!

147
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,112
Here I go!

148
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,239
Now!

149
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,950
Everyone, run!

150
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,506
Just a little further
until the suspension bridge!

151
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,141
No way.

152
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,310
The suspension bridge…

153
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,812
It was our only way out.

154
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:17,820
Damn it!

155
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,364
Isn't there anything we can do?

156
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,158
Hey, guys!

157
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:25,787
Take this!

158
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,293
You're…

159
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,670
Mr. Kumano!

160
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,839
I came to see what the zombies
were up in arms about

161
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,300
only to see your bridge was out!

162
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:41,886
I built you a brand new one in a jiffy!

163
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:48,059
I told you I'd help you out
if you ran into any trouble!

164
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,815
They're already here!

165
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,568
We'll hold up the bridge!

166
00:12:57,652 --> 00:13:00,321
Get across now!

167
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,325
Hurry!

168
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,828
Hurry!

169
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,830
Everyone got across!

170
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,458
You ready for this, Kencho?

171
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,210
You bet, Akira!

172
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,803
This is super scary!

173
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,388
This is super scary!

174
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,613
-Ouch!
-Ouch!

175
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,337
He just wanted friends?

176
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:04,802
If that's really all Higurashi wanted,
then he's a god damned fool.

177
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,763
Yeah.

178
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,767
But when I was working
for that exploitative company,

179
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,518
I also lost sight of myself.

180
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:17,690
Every day was so painful
and I didn't know what I was living for.

181
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:25,031
If I had wanted to make my own
twisted list like that black notebook,

182
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,116
I could have.

183
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,660
Anyone could've become like Higurashi.

184
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:35,416
So despite everything, I can't hate him.

185
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,796
There we go.

186
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,177
Good job, Akira.

187
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:51,599
Without you, your mom and everyone
in the village wouldn't be here.

188
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,687
I'm proud of you, son!

189
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,403
So, does this mean I was able
to repay you just a little?

190
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,828
38. GIVE BACK TO MY PARENTS

191
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,957
Now! Seal it off!

192
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,751
Are those all the zombies?

193
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:21,045
We searched every inch of the village!

194
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,672
There's no mistaking!

195
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,636
You're planning on restarting here
in the village?

196
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,640
Well, we only have one hometown.

197
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:39,480
Now that Mr. Kumano has moved here
and is leading the rebuilding,

198
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,108
everyone is peppier than ever.

199
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,694
It seems like
they got a second shot at life.

200
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:49,699
I expect it won't be long before the
village is back to the way it was before.

201
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,578
It's all thanks to you.

202
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,165
You were our village doctor, remember?

203
00:15:57,248 --> 00:16:00,251
Not really! I'm not even a doctor!

204
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:05,006
You cured us old whiners
when we were ready to give in.

205
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,217
I can't thank you enough.

206
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,973
-Hold this.
-Okay.

207
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,937
Steadier! Otherwise,
we won't finish before dinner!

208
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,481
Okay!

209
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,486
Angie, you're like
an entirely different person.

210
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,114
Crying won't repair this fence!

211
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,743
And besides, I don't want
to keep crying over zombies.

212
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,455
I was able to move forward
because a funny guy got me to smile.

213
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,001
Thank you, Mr. Stand-Up Comic!

214
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,756
34. BECOME A STAND-UP COMIC

215
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:58,976
He's sleeping well.

216
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,649
He wore himself ragged up until now…

217
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,444
Everyday he'd ask me,

218
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:14,116
"Have we heard from Akira yet?"
"Is Akira doing all right?"

219
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:19,080
Well, in a world full of zombies,
even a curmudgeon like Dad would…

220
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,665
No, not that!

221
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,668
He started asking the day after
you left for Tokyo.

222
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,929
If…

223
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:39,559
I'm not saying that it will, but…

224
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,647
If anything happens to you, Dad,
I promise that I'll always

225
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,817
keep Mom and the village safe!

226
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:51,571
I'll do it for you, Dad!

227
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:01,038
By the way, what does Dad have?

228
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,293
Hemorrhoids?

229
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,005
-That's it? Hemorrhoids?
-That's right!

230
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,964
<i>Hemorrhoids?</i>

231
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,800
He hates hospitals,
so he didn't get them treated.

232
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,136
So now, the bleeding is really bad.

233
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,388
The pain is so terrible
that he can't stand.

234
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,723
It's awful.

235
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,976
So then why is he wheezing?

236
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,771
Lately, it's been considerably hot
in the countryside, even at night.

237
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,190
It makes it difficult
for old-timers to sleep.

238
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:30,860
But we can't ignore hemorrhoids!

239
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:36,240
If we leave them alone, they could lead
to a life-threatening infection!

240
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,622
I see. It's just hemorrhoids.

241
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,792
<i>Find your dream, Akira.</i>

242
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,462
<i>Biggest one you can.</i>

243
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:53,674
<i>A man without a dream</i>
<i>is nothing more than a jellyfish.</i>

244
00:18:56,469 --> 00:19:00,723
If that's the case, I think it's time
for me to leave the village.

245
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,851
What about the village?

246
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:08,230
Akira, what do you wish to do
outside of the village?

247
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:12,777
If the zombies are caused
by a virus like Shizuka says,

248
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,032
I'll travel the country and look for a way
to stop the infection.

249
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,744
Then I'll convince Dad
to get surgery for his hemorrhoids!

250
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:28,584
"Help humanity."
"Do what you can for the world."

251
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,753
Those were Dad's last wishes after all!

252
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,172
<i>-He's still alive though.</i>
<i>-He's still alive though.</i>

253
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,007
Saving the world.

254
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,343
That's wild.

255
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,721
It's a big dream.

256
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,348
I like it!

257
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,026
40. MAKE DAD GET SURGERY

258
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,695
What about all of you?

259
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,656
Is there anything you want to add?

260
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,371
In that case, I'm adding one.

261
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:10,668
I'm sure there are lots of people across
Japan who are crying like Angie!

262
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,921
This time,
I want to fulfill my childhood dream!

263
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:14,922
42. BECOME A DOCTOR

264
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:18,801
So far, I've only toured
the zombie infested parts of Nippon.

265
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,386
43. RESTORE NIPPON'S NATURAL BEAUTY

266
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,804
Very nice!

267
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,182
Let's keep it up and write all the things
we'd like to do across Japan!

268
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,934
I want to party on a cruise ship!

269
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,686
I want to swim with dolphins!

270
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,938
I want to live in a castle!

271
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,066
-How about a waterfall meditation?
-I want to ride an ostrich!

272
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,194
I've always wanted
to eat Yobuko squid served live!

273
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:40,030
I want to experience
<i>hatsumōde</i> at Ise Shrine.

274
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,658
-Me too!
-Nice one!

275
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,118
We can do that!

276
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,622
Got enough water?

277
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,249
Take some vegetables too!

278
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,460
It's going to get colder from here on.

279
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:54,670
Take whatever you need.

280
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,255
Thank you so much!

281
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,840
Akemi!

282
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,720
I'll always be waiting
for you to come back, you hear?

283
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:07,475
Old Man Hiko, I'm not Akemi.

284
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,226
I'm Shizuka.

285
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,858
It's going to get lonely, isn't it?

286
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:23,032
I think it's okay to cry in front of him
since you're saying goodbye.

287
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,378
Mr. Kencho!

288
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:42,676
When you come back, show me
how you slurp udon with your butt!

289
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:47,181
Enough already!

290
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,934
We don't need this much simmered seaweed!

291
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,310
It's fine. Just take it.

292
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,312
It'll keep!

293
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:58,567
I don't like the idea of you
going hungry somewhere.

294
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,902
Mom.

295
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,821
Akira!

296
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,864
Leave your mother to me!

297
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,330
Okay, everyone!

298
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,415
We're just going to go

299
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,752
{\an8}and save the world!

300
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,045
6. TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY

301
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,505
So, what's the plan, Akira?

302
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,383
Stopping a virus means
we'll need a vaccine, right?

303
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,428
Are we heading to an infectious disease
research lab? A U.S. military base?

304
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,514
-We'll go north!
-North?

305
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,100
Because all good travelers venture north!

306
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,561
{\an8}Isn't it exciting?

307
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:12,016
{\an8}Is it just me, or does it seem like
we're just sightseeing?

308
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,810
{\an8}Are we really searching for a solution?

309
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:16,729
{\an8}I think it's all good!

310
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,607
Hey, it's coming into view!

311
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,609
The Seikan Tunnel!

312
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,946
All right! Next up is Hokkaido!

313
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,824
Sounds good to me!
