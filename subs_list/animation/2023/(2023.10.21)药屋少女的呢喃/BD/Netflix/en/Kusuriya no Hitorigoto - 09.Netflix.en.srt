ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,386
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICTION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,805
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,309
{\an8}-Yeah.
-I think so.

5
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,560
{\an8}He's very suspicious!

6
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,021
{\an8}Then there's a new problem, right?

7
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,363
Alcohol… Bring me more alcohol…

8
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,616
He's changed so much.

9
00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:00,120
Looking at his face makes
alcohol taste bad.

10
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,038
I agree completely.

11
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,090
Huh? Thanks…

12
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,393
How long are you going to sulk like that?

13
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,686
I'm not sulking.

14
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,064
Please don't forget,
you're at work right now.

15
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,315
I get it.

16
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,402
<i>He doesn't get it.</i>

17
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:37,657
<i>A man like Sir Jinshi does not</i>
<i>respond like a child like that.</i>

18
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,370
<i>A man like Sir Jinshi does not</i>
<i>get attached to his toys like that.</i>

19
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,874
Here's more work for you.

20
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:54,799
<i>That day, I struggled in getting details</i>
<i>of what happened from Concubine Gyokuyou.</i>

21
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,554
<i>-She couldn't stop laughing.</i>
-A misunderstanding?

22
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:03,641
<i>She explained the payment for the surety</i>
<i>was a meeting with a popular courtesan.</i>

23
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,728
<i>To think that</i>
<i>that girl had such connections…</i>

24
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,148
<i>And what sorts of things</i>
<i>did my master imagine?</i>

25
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,817
<i>Youth is a scary thing.</i>

26
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:18,531
<i>But to think that he finished his work</i>
<i>so quickly so that</i>

27
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,742
<i>he could go meet the girl,</i>

28
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,996
<i>only to learn she had gone home</i>
<i>with another man…</i>

29
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,499
<i>It must've been quite the shock.</i>

30
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:38,843
<i>Why can't they use their heads</i>
<i>a little more?</i>

31
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:44,140
<i>Many bureaucrats try to propose laws</i>
<i>that only benefit them.</i>

32
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:49,103
<i>I do feel pity that his workload is</i>
<i>increasing from such nonsense.</i>

33
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,320
Sir Jinshi!

34
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,615
Work hours have ended. Can't this wait?

35
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:04,702
No, this isn't about work. The thing is…

36
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,541
Sir Kounen is…?

37
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,794
-Sir Jinshi.
-Let's go, quickly!

38
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,800
Oh, my. That's terrible news…

39
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,303
<i>Apparently, some high-up</i>
<i>bureaucrat has died.</i>

40
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,305
<i>This may be a bit harsh,</i>

41
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,434
<i>but I'm not so sentimental as to mourn</i>
<i>someone who's a complete stranger.</i>

42
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,104
<i>He was in his fifties,</i>
<i>and the cause of death</i>

43
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:33,231
<i>was over drinking.</i>

44
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,983
<i>He brought this onto himself.</i>

45
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,903
<i>But if this person</i>

46
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:43,491
<i>went out of his way to get</i>
<i>the head lady-in-waiting to leave, then…</i>

47
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:46,828
Apothecary. Do you really think
the cause of death was alcohol?

48
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,289
<i>I knew he would ask that.</i>

49
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,583
Anyone who enjoys alcohol

50
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,962
would know that drinking too much
is bad for your body.

51
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,340
Over-drinking for many years causes
your organs to deteriorate.

52
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,261
Drinking a large amount at once
could cause death in some cases.

53
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,931
I heard that he was at a banquet
and drank a large amount of alcohol.

54
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,558
In that case, he would die.

55
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,061
But Sir Kounen holds his liquor well.

56
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,646
I don't believe
he died from over drinking.

57
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,277
<i>The dead man's name was Kounen.</i>

58
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,031
<i>He was a vivacious soldier who could</i>
<i>chug an entire bottle,</i>

59
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,782
<i>and he was well-liked.</i>

60
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,868
-Gaoshun.
-Yes, sir.

61
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,371
This is the alcohol
he was drinking at the banquet.

62
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,167
<i>Alright, alcohol!</i>

63
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,669
The bottle containing Sir Kounen' drink.

64
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,213
It was knocked over
and all of it spilled out.

65
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:45,386
So we wouldn't know if that bottle
contained poison.

66
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,096
Exactly.

67
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,226
<i>He's lacking energy today. He probably</i>
<i>knows he's asking for a lot again.</i>

68
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,438
<i>He should be his usual glittering self.</i>

69
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,274
<i>These days, I can't help but see</i>
<i>Sir Jinshi</i>

70
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,526
<i>as much more child-like</i>
<i>than he used to be.</i>

71
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,951
<i>There's a mix of sweet and salty flavors.</i>

72
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,455
<i>It tastes like someone added salt</i>
<i>to an originally sweet alcohol…</i>

73
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,167
-What's wrong?
-It has a unique taste.

74
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,669
Yes. It's sweet, right?

75
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,089
It's what Sir Kounen liked.

76
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,507
He loved sweets more than anything.

77
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:27,261
He wouldn't touch even the most expensive
smoked meats or rock salts.

78
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,429
I see.

79
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,723
He used to like spicy things, but he said

80
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,392
he suddenly developed an appetite
for sweet things.

81
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,437
Even his meals were mostly sweet.

82
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,314
That would cause diabetes.

83
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,776
Don't bring my memory back to reality.

84
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,780
-You're still drinking?
<i>-Spice-lover turned sweet-lover, huh?</i>

85
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,283
Was there salt at this banquet?

86
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:54,539
Yes. They served rock salt,
moon cakes, and dried meats.

87
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,083
Should I prepare the same things?

88
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,211
No.
I'll finish drinking before it's ready.

89
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,838
That's not what I was….

90
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,883
Can we get our hands on the bottle
Sir Kounen was drinking from?

91
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,261
It's shattered into pieces.

92
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,178
It doesn't matter.

93
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,731
There's another thing
I want you to look into.

94
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,446
Excuse me.

95
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,870
-Here's the report.
-Thank you very much.

96
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,376
I knew it.

97
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,296
This is the bottle.

98
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,888
Is it okay to lick it?

99
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,348
There's no poison in here.

100
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,481
It's salt?

101
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,276
Precisely. You mentioned, Sir Jinshi,

102
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:09,238
that Sir Kounen suddenly developed
a liking for sweet things.

103
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,366
-And he only ate sweets after that.
-Yes.

104
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,370
But in this bottle has so much salt
that there are grains leftover

105
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,247
after it has dried.

106
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,919
Salt is a necessary ingredient
for the human body,

107
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,213
but too much, and it becomes poison.

108
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,006
So the cause of death was…

109
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,258
Considering how much he drank,

110
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,886
and how much salt was dissolved
in the drink,

111
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,514
this could very much be
the cause of death.

112
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,224
But if he drank

113
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,227
something this salty,
wouldn't he notice the taste…

114
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,230
He didn't notice.
Please take a look at this.

115
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:47,568
These are the records of
Sir Kounen's lifestyle habits.

116
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,614
Looking at this,
my guess is that Sir Kounen

117
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,492
lost the ability to taste salt.

118
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:55,409
There's no way…

119
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,246
<i>I learned that Kounen</i>

120
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,331
<i>was a diligent and talented bureaucrat,</i>

121
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,874
<i>who lived a monastic life.</i>

122
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,090
<i>And many years ago,</i>

123
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,551
<i>he lost his wife</i>
<i>and child to an epidemic disease.</i>

124
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,179
<i>After that, all he did was work.</i>

125
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,933
<i>His only place of joy was in</i>
<i>alcohol and sweets.</i>

126
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,436
There is an illness where one loses
their sense of taste.

127
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,357
Causes include an imbalanced diet
or stress.

128
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,985
Diligent people often suppress
their emotions.

129
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,195
and that burden can lead to illness.

130
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,283
So who placed the salt
in the alcohol bottle?

131
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,037
It's not my job to investigate that.

132
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:45,042
However, there was salt added
to yesterday's alcohol as well.

133
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,796
It could be someone who didn't like
sweet drinks

134
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,090
added the salt from the banquet.

135
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:56,178
<i>Or… There are many people</i>
<i>that dislike diligent and honest people.</i>

136
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,932
<i>Perhaps they played a prank on someone</i>
<i>they didn't like</i>

137
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,185
<i>by messing with their alcohol</i>
<i>at the party.</i>

138
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,940
<i>And if that person continues drinking</i>
<i>without noticing,</i>

139
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,694
<i>they might keep adding more salt</i>
<i>until they do notice.</i>

140
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,489
-Gaoshun.
-Yes.

141
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,658
Yes, sir.

142
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,454
<i>I'm such a coward.</i>

143
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:27,043
<i>At this point, I'm basically telling them</i>
<i>who the culprit is.</i>

144
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:32,256
<i>I don't want to be the direct cause</i>
<i>of anyone's punishment.</i>

145
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,342
Sorry about that.

146
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,093
-You helped a lot.
-Thank you.

147
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,305
<i>An obsidian tassel…</i>

148
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,766
<i>Is he in mourning?</i>

149
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,352
He must've been a great man.

150
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,855
Yes. He took care of me when I was young.

151
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,613
<i>He looks like a regular young man.</i>

152
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,617
<i>I guess he's human after all.</i>

153
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,371
Oh, I almost forgot.

154
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,043
-This is a gift of thanks.
-A gourd?

155
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,337
Yes, although it's different
from what you had yesterday.

156
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,631
It's alcohol?

157
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,384
-Yeah. Don't get caught, all right?
-Yes, sir.

158
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,886
Thank you!

159
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,394
You don't look that grateful to me.

160
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,354
You think so?

161
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,065
I think you should be
getting back to work.

162
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,777
<i>I knew it, he's slacking off from work.</i>

163
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,571
You should finish
before it starts piling up.

164
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:38,989
I have been working…

165
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:44,161
-What kind of work?
-For example, I'm working on a bill.

166
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,581
They say they should
prevent the youth from over-drinking,

167
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,084
and they should set an age limit.

168
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,043
Huh?

169
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,839
The law states that drinking is prohibited
until you're 20.

170
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,720
Sir Jinshi…

171
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,974
Make sure that never passes, all right?

172
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,565
That's out of my hands.

173
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,983
Sir Jinshi!

174
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,433
Doctor!

175
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,729
It's this way!

176
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,527
A ghost!

177
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,784
You're lucky it was winter.

178
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,454
The body is in a good state
considering that she drowned.

179
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,664
How can you stare?

180
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,251
-Where was the body found?
-She was floating in an outside moat.

181
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,879
From her clothes,
she must be a servant in the rear palace.

182
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,341
<i>I see.</i>
<i>That's why they called for the old man.</i>

183
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:24,595
<i>And the quack doctor.</i>
<i>The one doing the autopsy is like this…</i>

184
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:28,307
-Miss, can you look for me?
-No.

185
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,435
I've been told not to touch the body.

186
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,646
That's surprising.

187
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:37,024
-Sir Jinshi!
-How do you do, Sir Jinshi.

188
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,236
Looks like you're used to dead bodies.

189
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,279
I've seen them many times.

190
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,449
The back alleys of the pleasure district
are a lawless area.

191
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,118
Why can't you touch the body?

192
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,371
I've been instructed
by my apothecary master.

193
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:53,749
-Because it's bad luck?
-No…

194
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,628
Because humans can also become
"ingredients for medicine."

195
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,422
I'm sure with your curious nature,

196
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,717
you will start robbing graves
if you try it even once.

197
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,595
Never cross that line, okay?

198
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:07,763
Yes, sir.

199
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,431
I see. That makes sense.

200
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,642
<i>That's rude of them.</i>

201
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,145
Doctor, could you please take a look?

202
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,897
Yes, sir…

203
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,111
Geez…

204
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:27,908
<i>She's tall, wearing hard, wooden shoes.</i>

205
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,621
<i>Bandaged on one foot with red fingertips…</i>

206
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,627
<i>It must've been cold inside the water.</i>

207
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,551
The girl was a Food Service maid,

208
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,262
and had been working as usual yesterday.

209
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,348
The guard speculates she climbed
the fence last night

210
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,267
and jumped into the moat.

211
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,227
In other words, it was suicide by jumping.

212
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,688
Suicide by jumping…

213
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,984
-What do you think?
-I don't know if it's suicide or not.

214
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,904
But I think it was impossible
to accomplish on her own.

215
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,030
What do you mean?

216
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,283
<i>There were no ladders along the wall,</i>

217
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,911
<i>and there were no climbing tools either.</i>

218
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,289
<i>The castle walls of the rear palace</i>
<i>are four times my height.</i>

219
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,875
So you need a tool to climb.

220
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,919
Usually, yes.

221
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,588
Strictly speaking,

222
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,507
it's possible to climb the walls
without tools.

223
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,428
Do you remember the ghost incident
from before?

224
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:31,305
-The one with Concubine Fuyou?
-Yes.

225
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,809
<i>I wondered how Concubine Fuyou</i>
<i>climbed the outer walls,</i>

226
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,188
<i>so I performed a close investigation</i>
<i>of the castle walls.</i>

227
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:42,358
<i>There, I found a protrusion that</i>
<i>must've been used</i>

228
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,151
<i>by the carpenters.</i>

229
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,948
But it would be difficult for
most women to climb,

230
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,034
let alone a woman with bound feet
like that maid…

231
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:58,165
<i>Foot binding is based on the belief that</i>
<i>the smaller your feet, the more beautiful.</i>

232
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,251
<i>It's not performed on all women,</i>
<i>but I often see women</i>

233
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,089
<i>with a distinctive walking style</i>
<i>in the rear palace.</i>

234
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,716
So if it's not suicide,

235
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,718
you're saying it's murder?

236
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,804
I don't know about that.

237
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,100
But I am sure that she was alive
when she fell into the moat.

238
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,896
She must've kept scratching the fence
to climb up.

239
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,983
The fingertips on the body were red
from bleeding.

240
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:31,448
So, was it suicide or murder?

241
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:44,378
<i>I would never consider taking my own life.</i>

242
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,589
<i>I'd never want to get murdered either.</i>

243
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,427
<i>Once you die, you can't test</i>
<i>for any medicine or poison.</i>

244
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,225
<i>But if I were to die…</i>

245
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,687
What are you thinking?

246
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,897
About what poison I'd use
if I were to die.

247
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:07,985
-What? You mean to die?
-Not at all.

248
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,738
But you never know when
you could die, right?

249
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,702
Even if you don't wish it,
someone's ill wishes could

250
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,747
lead to an unwanted death.

251
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,831
Like Sir Kounen.

252
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,629
You never know when death will visit you.

253
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,674
You cannot defeat fate, no matter what…

254
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,834
-Sir Jinshi.
-What is it?

255
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,672
If you are ever going to execute me,

256
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:53,549
can you kill me with poison?

257
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,300
Why would that happen?

258
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,679
If I ever make a mistake
and offend anyone,

259
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,889
I'm sure you will be the one to punish me.

260
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,153
<i>Have I already offended him?</i>

261
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,865
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

262
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,576
I won't complain even if it's death
by hanging or beheading.

263
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,870
I'm saying, why would that happen?

264
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,874
Because I'm a peasant.

265
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,585
My life could be taken away
by any small mistake.

266
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,211
I'd never do that.

267
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,422
No matter what you will or won't do.

268
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,424
It could happen.

269
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,303
<i>Looks like I shouldn't have said that.</i>

270
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:44,183
If we're finished here, I'll be off.

271
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:05,412
<i>Later, I heard rumors that the dead maid</i>
<i>was present</i>

272
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:09,958
<i>at the poisoning incident</i>
<i>at the garden party.</i>

273
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,128
<i>They even found a suicide note,</i>

274
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,340
<i>and thus, the case was ruled a suicide</i>
<i>and closed.</i>

275
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,099
The reports from the other day
are finally here.

276
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:30,354
Two months since I ordered a search
for a person with a burn on their arm.

277
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,856
You took too much time.

278
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,733
I'm sorry, sir.

279
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,069
So, who was it?

280
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:40,155
It was someone higher-ranked
than we expected.

281
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,408
Fengming, from The Garnet Pavilion.

282
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,167
She's the head lady-in-waiting
for the Pure Concubine, Lady Ah-Duo.

283
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,170
I see.

284
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,756
You may leave.

285
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,930
Concubine Ah-Duo…
