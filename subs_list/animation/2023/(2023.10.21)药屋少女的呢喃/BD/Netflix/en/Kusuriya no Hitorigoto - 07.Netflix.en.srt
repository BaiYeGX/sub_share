4
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,264
Old man!

5
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,185
Old man!

6
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,283
I hope old man's doing well…

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,790
Oh, right.
Yesterday, after the garden party….

8
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,250
What are you saying?

9
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,128
The minister who ate the poison
needed a lot of treatment!

10
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,587
A patient should rest!

11
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,467
Thanks to them, I slept well.

12
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,594
But I shouldn't have slept until noon.

13
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,686
I'd feel weird not wearing my freckles…

14
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,861
You should've taken the day off today.

15
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:37,365
That's not acceptable.
If you need anything from me, just ask.

16
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,367
Oh? Your freckles…

17
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,621
I feel weird without them.
Can I keep my face like this?

18
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,665
Of course. You're right.

19
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,835
Everyone rushed in demanding to know
who my lady-in-waiting was.

20
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:50,295
It was hard!

21
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,506
-I'm so sorry about that.
-It's fine.

22
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,801
Oh, Gaoshun's been here since
this morning. Do you want to talk to him?

23
00:02:57,385 --> 00:03:01,431
He looked bored, so I asked him
to weed the garden.

24
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,808
Weeding the garden…

25
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,770
<i>He was seated in a high position</i>
<i>at the garden party…</i>

26
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,314
<i>He's such a diligent man…</i>

27
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,900
<i>I'm sure that man is also</i>

28
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:15,653
<i>collecting his own group</i>
<i>of lady-in-waiting fans.</i>

29
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:20,033
May we borrow the drawing room?

30
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,910
Certainly.

31
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,661
-Hongniang?
-Yes, my lady.

32
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,665
<i>I feel like Hongniang's eyes</i>
<i>are glistening too…</i>

33
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,335
This is for you, from Sir Jinshi.

34
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:36,090
This is the soup that Lady Gyokuyou
was meant to drink.

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,427
-Yes.
-How thoughtful of you.

36
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,972
-Don't eat it, all right?
-I won't.

37
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:48,019
Silver corrodes quickly.
The soup is oxidized.

38
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:51,105
-It won't taste good.
-It's about the taste…?

39
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,358
Did you carry this with your bare hands?

40
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,985
No. I didn't touch the bowl.

41
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,529
I just dipped in a spoon
to see if it was poison.

42
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,950
After that, I wrapped it quickly
with cloth.

43
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,703
Please wait a minute.

44
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,872
Snip, snip, snip.
Clatter, clatter, clatter.

45
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:13,086
-Cotton, powder, and a brush?
-Yes.

46
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,379
What will you do with these?

47
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,966
At the apothecary I worked at,
to prevent pranks,

48
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,344
we applied dye to containers
you weren't supposed to touch.

49
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,179
I'm doing a version of that now.

50
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:27,684
It's easy. Add some powder
to a rolled up cotton ball,

51
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,687
and apply it on the container.

52
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,107
After that, I'll take off the extra powder
using this brush.

53
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,821
-Here it is.
-I see a white mark.

54
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,283
This is the spot where someone
touched the surface.

55
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,370
Any spot touched by a fingertip
leaves some sort of mark.

56
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:51,249
This is especially true for
silverware that corrodes easily.

57
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,711
Silverware is always wiped down
with a cloth before being used.

58
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,631
In that case, the fingerprint
left on this bowl now belongs to

59
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,718
the person who held this bowl
after it was cleaned?

60
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,428
Exactly.

61
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,222
The size and the location of
the fingerprint

62
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,267
is enough to tell us how they held it.

63
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,436
The person who held this bowl…

64
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,188
What's wrong?

65
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,278
It's nothing.

66
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:24,240
My guess is there were a total of
four people that held this bowl.

67
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,408
Four people, you say?

68
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,495
<i>First are the three that touched</i>
<i>around the bowl.</i>

69
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:33,708
<i>The person who served the soup,</i>
<i>the person who carried the bowl,</i>

70
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,544
<i>the food taster for Lady Lishu,</i>

71
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:42,800
<i>and finally, one more. A third party</i>
<i>who touched the rim of the bowl…</i>

72
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:47,555
I think it's safe to assume that
the poison was placed by this third party.

73
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,516
If that's true, why is the fingerprint

74
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,936
of the food taster found
on a high-ranking concubine's bowl?

75
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,522
It's simple.

76
00:05:56,606 --> 00:06:01,152
The food taster for Lady Lishu
swapped it on purpose to trouble her.

77
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,821
-Not knowing it was poison.
-She swapped it?

78
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,282
It's bullying.

79
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,576
A lady-in-waiting bullying.

80
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,162
-To a high-ranking concubine?
-So you don't believe it?

81
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,289
Please tell me.

82
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:19,378
I want to warn you in advance
that this is my personal speculation.

83
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,838
That's no problem.

84
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,926
Do you remember Lady Lishu's outfit
at the garden party?

85
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:27,804
Yes. It was a flashy, pink costume.

86
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,139
<i>Normally, if a concubine</i>

87
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,101
<i>chooses an outfit that is too similar</i>
<i>to Lady Gyokuyou's,</i>

88
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,562
the attendants would recommend
a different outfit.

89
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,900
If not, the attendants would wear outfits
that match their lady.

90
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:45,613
However, all her ladies-in-waiting
were wearing white.

91
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,827
<i>That made it seem as if</i>
<i>Lady Lishu, who was wearing pink,</i>

92
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,579
<i>was a clown who couldn't read the room.</i>

93
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,498
<i>Attendants are meant to</i>
<i>support their lady.</i>

94
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,751
If so, that day…

95
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,004
You can't even understand
your own position as an attendant?

96
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,257
To think you recommended
a pink outfit for her!

97
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,469
<i>Lady Ah-Duo's attendants were reprimanding</i>

98
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,055
<i>the incompetence</i>
<i>of Lady Lishu's attendants.</i>

99
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,975
<i>In the rear palace,</i>

100
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,436
surrounded by enemies,
the only people concubines can trust

101
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,729
are her own ladies-in-waiting.

102
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:22,608
The young Lady Lishu merely followed
the recommendation of her attendants

103
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,734
and wore that outfit

104
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,321
<i>and was shamed publicly on purpose.</i>

105
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,906
<i>She had no idea.</i>

106
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,369
Not only that, but they also swapped meals

107
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,289
to trouble Lady Lishu even more?

108
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:41,377
Yes, without knowing it was poison.
Though it ended up saving her life.

109
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,256
Their methods are dirty.

110
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,177
Why would they do such a thing?

111
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,389
<i>Lady Lishu is in the unique position</i>
<i>of being the former emperor's concubine,</i>

112
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,933
<i>then entering monkhood soon after.</i>

113
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,979
<i>She had been educated since childhood</i>

114
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,607
<i>that a wife serves her husband.</i>

115
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,319
<i>People must think that it is</i>
<i>extremely immoral of her</i>

116
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,696
<i>to marry her late husband's son.</i>

117
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,492
I think the print left on the rim

118
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,120
belongs to the culprit
who added the poison.

119
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:20,875
-She held the rim to mix in the poison.
-I see.

120
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,462
You must not dirty the area
where a high-class person's lips touch

121
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,422
with your fingers.

122
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,882
Hongniang taught me that.

123
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,052
Those are my speculations.

124
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,098
-Can I ask you one thing?
-What is it?

125
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:41,896
Why did you try to cover for
the food taster attendant yesterday?

126
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,152
I'm just curious.
I won't pursue this any further.

127
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,324
The life of an attendant

128
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,661
is worth much less
than that of a concubine.

129
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:02,792
Especially the life of a food taster…

130
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,884
I'll think of a good excuse
for Sir Jinshi.

131
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,136
Thank you very much.

132
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:21,352
I have to thank her in some way

133
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:22,687
for swapping the bowls.

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,607
I did get to taste the poison, after all.

135
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,488
I really should've swallowed that soup…

136
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,995
-That's all.
-I see.

137
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,498
You're clever at wording things, as usual.

138
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:47,712
-Is that so?
-It's clearly an inside job, right?

139
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:50,006
Yes, looking at the circumstances.

140
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,259
You put it so simply.

141
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:58,431
Because of this, I haven't slept
since yesterday. I haven't even changed.

142
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,890
I want to stop thinking.

143
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,977
Your true nature is coming out.

144
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,397
-No one's here. It's fine.
-I'm here.

145
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,942
-That doesn't count.
-Yes sir, it does.

146
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:14,447
-There's no way to trick you, is there?
-I've known you too long for that.

147
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,367
It's troublesome to be taken care of
by someone since you were born…

148
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,747
Sir Jinshi.
Your hair clip is still in your hair.

149
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,750
Oh, shit. I totally forgot.

150
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,752
It was hidden in your hair.

151
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,047
I don't think
anyone figured out your true status.

152
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,715
Keep this, will you?

153
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:36,260
Don't treat it so roughly.

154
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:42,266
This can only be worn by those
with special status. Be careful.

155
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,645
-I know, I know.
-No, you don't.

156
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,106
All right, then. I'll be off.

157
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,072
Time for work…

158
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,371
-So, did you receive any hair clips?
-Yeah.

159
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,125
I see. That means…

160
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,087
You can leave the rear palace!

161
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,551
-What did you say?
-You can leave the rear palace?

162
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,970
Give me the details!

163
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:22,973
Yes, ma'am…

164
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,145
In the rear palace, you can't meet men
from the outside,

165
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:33,442
but with special permission,
men could take palace women outside.

166
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,443
I see.

167
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,030
So that's what the hair clips
being given out in the garden party mean.

168
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,740
Exactly!

169
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,412
Alternately, you can use hair clips
to ask to be let out of the rear palace.

170
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,916
I see. Thanks, Xiaolan.
I'll give it a try.

171
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,502
You're very welcome!

172
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,713
Maomao, thanks for the hawthorn fruit!

173
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,757
It was delicious!

174
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:06,350
<i>I've received four hair clips in total.</i>
<i>Out of those, two were from men.</i>

175
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:12,189
Wait. If they lost their "male parts,"
are they not called men…?

176
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,233
<i>Apothecary!</i>

177
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,569
Okay.

178
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,910
Sir Lihaku, a palace woman
from the rear palace is here.

179
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,454
What? All right.

180
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:32,168
<i>What should I do? An obligatory hair clip</i>
<i>was taken seriously…</i>

181
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,087
<i>But I'd hate to turn down</i>
<i>a beauty's invitation…</i>

182
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,089
{\an8}THE JADE PAVILION: MAOMAO

183
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,968
I only gave a clip to one attendant
from the Jade Pavilion.

184
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,595
That means…

185
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,598
It's her!

186
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,852
So, how should I refuse her?

187
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,064
Excuse me.

188
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:57,943
Sorry for the wait.

189
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,279
Wait, who are you?

190
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:05,868
-I hear that a lot.
-Makeup really changes your looks.

191
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,328
I hear that a lot too.

192
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:12,291
And to call on me, of all people?

193
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,085
I'd like to visit home.

194
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:19,465
Home? Do you even know what this means?

195
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,259
I hear that it's possible to
visit home temporarily

196
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,428
if you can be my guarantor.

197
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,472
You've got some nerve.

198
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:30,392
An attendant like you, asking
a soldier like me to be a guarantor?

199
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,394
Exactly.

200
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:37,316
And you called me all the way here
just for that?

201
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,234
Yes.

202
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,029
Shall I call you bold or reckless?

203
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,032
So what?

204
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:49,453
You're asking me to be used as a tool
so you can visit home?

205
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,916
Not at all. I have something in mind
to gift you for the favor.

206
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,087
THE VERDIGRIS HOUSE REFERRAL: MEIMEI

207
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,423
How about a flower-watching party
at the Verdigris House?

208
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,427
The Verdigris House?

209
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:09,265
You're joking! That brothel is worth
a year's salary!

210
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,894
No need to worry. You'll understand
once you see this referral.

211
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,147
Pairin. Joka. Meimei.

212
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,234
I can't believe this even more now!

213
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:23,612
Even high-ranking officials can barely
afford those Three Princesses!

214
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,907
If you can't believe me,
it can't be helped.

215
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,119
I'm sorry for taking your time.

216
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,830
-Wait…
-This is extremely unfortunate.

217
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,542
I'll ask elsewhere.
Please pretend I never asked…

218
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,255
<i>Does this woman have other offers?</i>

219
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,258
<i>And they're rose quartz</i>
<i>and silver hair clips?</i>

220
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,052
<i>They're both of higher statuses than me!</i>

221
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,762
<i>Who is this girl?</i>

222
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,765
<i>Does this mean that</i>
<i>this offer is legitimate…?</i>

223
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,018
<i>No, it's too suspicious!</i>

224
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:58,981
<i>But if it's really true,</i>
<i>I'd never have the chance to meet</i>

225
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,524
<i>the Three Princesses again…</i>

226
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,818
<i>What should I do?</i>

227
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,697
So, what will you do?

228
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,624
I accept my loss.

229
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,918
Congrats, Maomao!

230
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,670
To think that Maomao would beat us…

231
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,132
-I'm so glad!
-You must've met someone wonderful!

232
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,384
Thank you.

233
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,845
Why are you so carefree?

234
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,389
It's okay. I'll bring back souvenirs.

235
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,434
-How did you meet this man?
-I just went with the flow…

236
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:40,022
From the looks of it, she doesn't know
the meaning of hair clips at all.

237
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,483
Yes. I'm certain.

238
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,277
Geez. I feel the worst for him…

239
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,448
This is so fun.

240
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,535
What face would he make?

241
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,414
Oh, gosh. Looks like there's going to be
another drama…

242
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,375
<i>Jinshi, having finished his work,</i>

243
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,211
<i>got bored and came to visit</i>

244
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:05,798
<i>the day after Maomao's departure.</i>

245
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:10,135
Maomao left with some mysterious man…

246
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,602
To visit home for three days!

247
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,357
<i>My home, the pleasure district,</i>
<i>is not so far away.</i>

248
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,069
<i>After crossing the fence and moat</i>
<i>of the rear palace,</i>

249
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,113
<i>it's within walking distance.</i>

250
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,867
<i>How extravagant, riding a carriage</i>
<i>for this distance…</i>

251
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,745
<i>But the Three Princesses</i>
<i>at the Verdigris House</i>

252
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,666
<i>are almost a god-like idol admired</i>
<i>even by regular people, after all…</i>

253
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,628
<i>It's an honor to be able to</i>
<i>witness them even once.</i>

254
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,880
We're almost there!

255
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,842
It's the pleasure district!

256
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:57,558
<i>There are girls that come to the district</i>
<i>wanting to become like their idols,</i>

257
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,351
<i>but it's not so easy.</i>

258
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,855
<i>Even for apprentices,</i>
<i>or courtesans-in-training,</i>

259
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>there's no guarantee she'd sell.</i>

260
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,070
-So this is the Verdigris House…
-Yes.

261
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:10,988
VERDIGRIS HOUSE

262
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,407
It's very dignified.

263
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,369
It's a historical brothel
with a full lineup from middle-ranking to

264
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,787
the highest ranking courtesan.

265
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,041
Long time no see, Granny!

266
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,293
How's everyone doing…

267
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,633
What do you mean, "Long time no see"?

268
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,718
You idiot!

269
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,721
Are you okay?
What's wrong with this old woman?

270
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,100
That's Grams,
the owner of the Verdigris House.

271
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,393
Brings me back.

272
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,146
This is how I used to
vomit poison back in the day.

273
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,774
What? So this is the very rich patron?

274
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:51,320
He has a handsome face,
and a good body too.

275
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,239
I hear you got promoted young.

276
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:57,785
Granny, that's not something to say
to someone's face.

277
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,162
Hey, go get Pairin.

278
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,081
-She should be taking tea today.
-Yes!

279
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:07,377
-Pairin…
-Are you confident in your arm muscles?

280
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,421
I do train daily.

281
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,883
<i>Oh? Maybe this could work…</i>

282
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,593
Right this way!

283
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,470
I'm nervous.

284
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,057
-Good luck out there!
-Thanks!

285
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,312
Maomao. I can't deal with you.

286
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,398
Disappearing for ten months
without contacting us…

287
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,361
I had no other choice.
You didn't read the wood tablet I sent?

288
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:36,323
Of course I did! Why else
would I entertain a first-timer?

289
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,617
I know.

290
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,954
This is half of all I earned
at the rear palace so far.

291
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:44,039
I asked them to pay in advance.

292
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,333
This is Pairin we're talking about!

293
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,293
This isn't enough at all.

294
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,463
-Come on. It's just tea!
-Idiot!

295
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,967
You don't really think nothing's happening
with those arms?

296
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,051
You think?

297
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,680
-But that's out of my control…
-Of course not!

298
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,015
I'll add it to your receipt.

299
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,559
I can't pay…

300
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,978
Then give me all your best customers!

301
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,982
Like that one, someone young
who I can keep squeezing out of!

302
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,110
<i>Could a eunuch be a customer?</i>

303
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,739
<i>Not him. The courtesans would fall</i>
<i>head over heels and run out of business.</i>

304
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,743
<i>I'd feel bad about offering Gaoshun</i>
<i>or the quack doctor…</i>

305
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:27,207
Maomao. Old man should be at home.
Go to him.

306
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,463
<i>Just crossing a street</i>
<i>from the pleasure district</i>

307
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,716
<i>changes the scenery completely.</i>

308
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,470
<i>The dilapidated houses, beggars,</i>
<i>and the syphilitic streetwalkers.</i>

309
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,474
It hasn't changed at all.

310
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,866
I'm home, old man.

311
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,870
Oh, welcome home. You're late.

312
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,874
<i>I finally arrived home.</i>

313
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,712
I was out getting dye
for my freckles that day.

314
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,047
But then…

315
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,310
I still have my term of service.

316
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,938
-I'm going back in two days.
-I see.

317
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:34,441
I'm sleepy, but I want a bath.

318
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:38,362
Go borrow the bath
at the Verdigris House tomorrow.

319
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,448
I'll do that.

320
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,802
The rear palace, huh?

321
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,429
Some trick of fate, huh?

322
