ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:35,512
{\an8}About today's plans,

3
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,514
{\an8}we'll have the Mid Festival
in the afternoon.

4
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,724
Sure.

5
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,276
I have a general idea
of what you're thinking about,

6
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,445
but don't forget about work.

7
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,281
I know.

8
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,706
Sir Lihaku. What's wrong?

9
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,625
Something bad has happened.

10
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,002
Something bad?

11
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,589
Remember the fire in the warehouse?

12
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,508
-Yes.
-On the same day, also this.

13
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,594
There was a theft
at a different warehouse.

14
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,765
They must've taken advantage of
all the commotion that night.

15
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,309
A looter at a fire, huh?

16
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,145
What was stolen?

17
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,442
<i>I guess this is</i>
<i>a behind-closed-doors discussion.</i>

18
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,575
We lost some ritual items.

19
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,660
Multiples of them, in fact.

20
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:43,037
Were they stored that carelessly?

21
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,874
I'm not entirely sure myself, but…

22
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,460
We don't have any knowledgeable managers
at the moment.

23
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,546
We had one that passed away last year.

24
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,548
What about the current manager?

25
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm sure he has general knowledge.

26
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,804
Apparently, he got food poisoning
a while back.

27
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,598
Food poisoning?

28
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,183
He got it from his favorite type
of seaweed.

29
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,187
He's unconscious,
and can't go back to work.

30
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,898
So we're in a bind.

31
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,609
<i>This sounds familiar.</i>

32
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:17,071
Could that be the bureaucrat
who loves delicacies?

33
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,948
How do you know?

34
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,783
It's a long story.

35
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,162
<i>A theft that occurred</i>
<i>at the same time as a fire.</i>

36
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:28,499
<i>The manager of the warehouse,</i>
<i>who was absent due to food poisoning.</i>

37
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,085
<i>It's too strange to be a coincidence.</i>

38
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,798
What kind of person was the manager
who passed away last year?

39
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,262
I know he was famous
for being straight-laced.

40
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,805
I can't think of the name.

41
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:46,226
I know that he loved sweets.

42
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,396
Could it be Sir Kounen?

43
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,690
Right, that's it!

44
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,276
Hey, how do you know these things?

45
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,945
It's a long story.

46
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,948
<i>This must be</i>
<i>the sweet-toothed high official</i>

47
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:02,533
<i>that I heard about from Sir Jinshi,</i>

48
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,911
<i>who died from overconsumption of salt.</i>

49
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,248
<i>Could this all be just coincidence?</i>

50
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,042
<i>Each incident looks like an accident,</i>

51
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,253
<i>but what if they were all orchestrated</i>

52
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,130
<i>by someone with some kind of purpose?</i>

53
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,300
So, did you need me for something?

54
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,302
Oh, right!

55
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,596
This thing that you gave me…

56
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,724
Oh, from the fire.

57
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,434
I tried to return it,

58
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,980
but the owner returned it to me,
saying he didn't want it.

59
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,776
I thought it was precious,
since it's a high-quality item.

60
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,904
Apparently, he got it
from some court lady.

61
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,739
A court lady?

62
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,866
Isn't it strange?

63
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,203
Why would someone give
a warehouse guard something like this?

64
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,332
<i>Apparently,</i>

65
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,584
<i>this guard escorted a court lady</i>

66
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,838
<i>outside the palace since she was</i>
<i>walking alone in the dark.</i>

67
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,633
<i>This smoking pipe was given to him then</i>
<i>to thank him.</i>

68
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,303
If you received something this nice,

69
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,139
you'd want to use it right away.

70
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,976
<i>Start a fire, and sneak</i>
<i>into a different warehouse</i>

71
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,228
<i>when the security is sparse.</i>

72
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,813
<i>If the court lady</i>

73
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,150
<i>gifted the guard with the smoking pipe</i>
<i>to accomplish this…</i>

74
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:20,361
Sir Lihaku, who was this court lady?

75
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,448
I asked for details,

76
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,826
but she was wearing a scarf,
so her face was hidden.

77
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,873
<i>Perhaps she was</i>
<i>hiding her face on purpose.</i>

78
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:32,832
<i>Could be.</i>

79
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,585
Apparently, she was tall for a woman,

80
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,504
and smelled of medicine.

81
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:43,092
You're not tall, so I know it wasn't you.

82
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,594
But do you have any ideas?

83
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,930
<i>The scent of medicine,</i>

84
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:50,224
<i>a tall court lady…</i>

85
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,644
Don't speak on speculation alone.

86
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,232
Other than the incidents
and accidents you listed,

87
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,526
did anything else strange happen?

88
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,280
That's easy for you to say, but…

89
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,450
Would looking into that dig anything up?

90
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,660
Maybe.

91
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,706
-Maybe not.
-Which is it?

92
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,879
Two coincidences could happen at once.

93
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,091
Maybe even three.

94
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,886
But if these coincidences keep adding up,

95
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,722
making it not so coincidental,

96
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,185
and if the tall court lady was
at the center of all this,

97
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,394
<i>what would that mean?</i>

98
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:41,234
<i>Even if the court lady named Suirei</i>
<i>becomes the central figure,</i>

99
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,652
<i>it has nothing to do with me.</i>

100
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:48,241
I see! You're smarter than you look!

101
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,411
You're as strong as you look, Sir Lihaku.

102
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,664
Please go easy on me.

103
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,544
You look like you're having fun.

104
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,797
You look like you're having fun.

105
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,342
We're not having fun.

106
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:08,553
I'll be on my way then.

107
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,518
You seem very close to that
military officer.

108
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:16,853
Do I?

109
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,355
Some things were bothering him

110
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,941
so he wanted to ask me
some questions about it.

111
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,153
<i>These incidents</i>

112
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,864
<i>could possibly be related to Sir Jinshi.</i>

113
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,994
Could I bother you with the details?

114
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,082
Those are some
strange connections, indeed.

115
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,167
Yes.

116
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,711
So, what do you think it means?

117
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,421
I don't know.

118
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,257
It seems as if they're trying
to set several traps,

119
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,552
hoping one might work,
rather than planning for

120
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,471
one big incident.

121
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,349
I see. So they might have
set up other traps.

122
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,311
Though it's hard to say for certain.

123
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,607
With all of the incidents, it's hard
to say whether they were planned or not.

124
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,611
It's still entirely possible that
they were all coincidences.

125
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,574
You're not interested?

126
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,576
Interested?

127
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,040
I'm a mere maidservant.

128
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,083
I only do as I'm told.

129
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,088
Then, what about this?

130
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,052
The other day, when I visited
some trading merchants,

131
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:34,013
I heard of an interesting item
going around.

132
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,684
This is what it's called.

133
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,522
Calculus bovis <i>are cow gallstones,</i>
<i>a type of medicine!</i>

134
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,484
<i>It's a top quality product that can only</i>
<i>be obtained from one in 1,000 cows!</i>

135
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,195
Could it be, he would give it to me?

136
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,489
Is it true? He's not bluffing?

137
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,702
-Do you want it?
-Please!

138
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,954
Xiaomao.

139
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:05,962
Excuse me, sir.

140
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,048
Looks like you're all in.

141
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,008
You'll really give this to me?

142
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,679
Depends on how well you do.

143
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,013
I understand.

144
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,016
As you wish, Sir Jinshi!

145
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,436
All right then, Gaoshun. Get right to it!

146
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,860
<i>This is the incident from the other day.</i>

147
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,739
<i>The official who got food poisoning was</i>
<i>from the Board of Rites.</i>

148
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,034
<i>If I remember correctly,</i>
<i>the Board of Rites</i>

149
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,704
<i>manages education and foreign affairs.</i>

150
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,251
<i>Only if I actually studied to become</i>
<i>a court lady.</i>

151
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,295
I'll leave these here.

152
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,089
Thank you.

153
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,009
Not a problem. Ask me anything

154
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,385
you don't know.

155
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,138
What kind of position is this?

156
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,767
This position works with festivities.

157
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,894
Festivities, huh?

158
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,567
Do you have anything to write with?

159
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,943
Oh, yes.

160
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,696
<i>Festivities, festivities…</i>

161
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,991
<i>The food-poisoned official and Sir Kounen</i>

162
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,076
<i>both worked with festivities.</i>

163
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,287
<i>And if the smoke pipe incident</i>

164
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,165
<i>was a way to ensure</i>
<i>that the ritual items were stolen…</i>

165
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,502
<i>There must be a place where these</i>
<i>"coincidental" events meet</i>

166
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,921
<i>to create an "inevitable."</i>

167
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,551
<i>If the ritual items were stolen</i>
<i>with this much planning,</i>

168
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,012
<i>it means they're used for big festivities.</i>

169
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,514
<i>Larger than Mid Festival.</i>

170
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,685
<i>I should look into when that will</i>
<i>take place.</i>

171
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:49,774
<i>Now that I think of it, Sir Jinshi did</i>
<i>purification ceremonies often.</i>

172
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,692
If you're interested in festivities,

173
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,569
this should be useful.

174
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,493
Is this a drawing
of where the ritual takes place?

175
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:03,204
Yes. It's on the western edge
of the outer court.

176
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,122
It's called the Altar of the Sapphire Sky.

177
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,249
It's a very strange design, right?

178
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,712
There's a large beam hanging
from the roof.

179
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,675
There's a large drape
over the central ritual altar.

180
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,263
<i>They lower the beam each time</i>
<i>to add ceremonial texts.</i>

181
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,933
You're very knowledgeable.

182
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,353
Yes. I'm not proud of this,
but before working at the archives,

183
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,189
I had a more proper position
at the Ministry of Rites.

184
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,817
I said something

185
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,444
to upset the higher-ups,
and I was sent here.

186
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:39,156
At first, I was afraid of its strength
or lack thereof,

187
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,867
but I'm glad there weren't any problems.

188
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,160
What do you mean?

189
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,540
<i>Because they hang the pole</i>
<i>from the ceiling, like this.</i>

190
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:49,166
<i>It's a very large pole,</i>

191
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,128
<i>so I was afraid that</i>
<i>it could potentially fall.</i>

192
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,171
<i>When I asked about its strength,</i>

193
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,258
I was demoted to work here.

194
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,678
<i>That could be very terrifying.</i>

195
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:03,931
<i>If the metal fittings</i>
<i>that fix the pole broke,</i>

196
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,976
<i>and the pole fell from the ceiling,</i>
<i>then the person</i>

197
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:12,231
<i>most at risk would be the performer of</i>
<i>the ritual, who would be right underneath.</i>

198
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,984
<i>Someone of nobility.</i>

199
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:19,905
An issue with strength and stability…

200
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:24,160
<i>But which ritual item was stolen?</i>

201
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:27,955
<i>If such a valuable item was stolen,</i>
<i>surely they'd make a new one…</i>

202
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,542
<i>Make a new one…</i>

203
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,503
Excuse me.

204
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,548
When will they hold a ceremony
in this hall next?

205
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,300
When?

206
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,011
Right. That would be today.

207
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,438
<i>If my speculation is correct,</i>

208
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,441
<i>this has been planned</i>
<i>for a very long time.</i>

209
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,904
<i>There's no certainty</i>
<i>that every part will work.</i>

210
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,532
<i>But by setting several traps,</i>
<i>a few of them will overlap.</i>

211
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,076
<i>That is how they led up to this moment.</i>

212
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,209
<i>It's just speculation, nothing more.</i>

213
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,046
<i>But what if that speculation was right?</i>

214
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,383
Here it is!

215
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,512
ALTAR OF THE SAPPHIRE SKY

216
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,937
Hey! What are you doing?

217
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,314
Please let me through!

218
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,442
-I can't allow that.
-It's an emergency!

219
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,946
A maidservant like you cannot
intervene in festivities!

220
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,575
<i>He's right. I'm just a maid.</i>

221
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,619
<i>I have no power.</i>

222
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,413
<i>But once something happens, it's too late.</i>

223
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,917
<i>That's how irreparable things</i>
<i>always happen!</i>

224
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,254
Someone's life is at risk.

225
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,464
Please cancel the festivities!

226
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,341
That's not something for you to decide.

227
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,884
If you want to say something,

228
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,762
write a comment in the suggestion box.

229
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,848
-It'll be too late then!
-I won't allow it!

230
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:14,144
There is a major fault
with the ritual altar.

231
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:17,064
Someone could have tampered with it.

232
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,857
If you don't let me in right now,

233
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,360
you'll regret it!

234
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,363
I'm telling you that there's danger.

235
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,490
And yet, you refuse to hear of it.

236
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,494
Right. I see what's going on.

237
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:34,039
It makes sense. You intend to
get in my way to make sure

238
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:36,750
that the scheme plays out.

239
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:41,005
{\an8}Perhaps you're connected to
whoever plotted all this.

240
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,026
<i>I'm about to lose consciousness…</i>

241
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:07,031
<i>It must be infuriating to be talked to</i>
<i>that way by a little girl.</i>

242
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,492
<i>I taunted him on purpose.</i>
<i>This was bound to happen.</i>

243
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,079
<i>But this incident isn't enough.</i>

244
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,040
<i>A small fight like this</i>

245
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,875
<i>couldn't stop the festivities.</i>

246
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,502
<i>I'm all right.</i>

247
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,213
<i>I can't afford to lose consciousness now.</i>

248
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,344
Are you done?

249
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,848
Please let me through.

250
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:39,438
There's someone of
noble blood inside, correct?

251
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:44,318
If something happens, wouldn't it
be all of you who are beheaded?

252
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,947
I'm not asking you
to stop the festivities.

253
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,700
Just let me go.

254
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,703
Just say a rat sneaked in by accident.

255
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,792
In that case, I'd be the only one
being beheaded!

256
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,796
You're saying I should believe
a little girl like you?

257
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,966
How about my word then?

258
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,517
You are…

259
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,897
And anyways,

260
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,442
what are you doing,
beating up a little girl like that?

261
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,613
She's hurt.

262
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,826
Anyways,

263
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,371
what if you listen to the girl
this one time?

264
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,581
I'll take full responsibility for this.

265
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,210
<i>I don't want to see who's behind me.</i>

266
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,088
<i>And he came at such</i>
<i>perfect timing, like he calculated it…</i>

267
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,216
<i>Now's not the time to think</i>
<i>about these things.</i>

268
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,094
<i>I don't care who's behind me.</i>

269
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,687
<i>I probably look terrible.</i>

270
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,106
<i>I'll ask Sir Gaoshun,</i>

271
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,067
<i>and once everything is over,</i>
<i>I'll take a nice, long bath.</i>

272
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,445
<i>I have to make sure</i>

273
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,656
<i>not to get beheaded before that.</i>

274
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,119
I made it…

275
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,003
I should stitch that up.

276
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,380
Hey.

277
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,222
How did this happen?

278
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,266
Sir Jinshi.

279
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,604
Could I have the <i>calculus bovis?</i>

280
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,441
Now's not the time for that.

281
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,486
What happened

282
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,405
to your face?

283
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:41,411
<i>Why is Sir Jinshi here?</i>

284
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,292
<i>Why does he look so sad?</i>

285
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:55,467
I'm sorry. Let me stitch up my leg…

286
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,095
Hey!

287
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,723
Hey! Hang in there!

288
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,267
Wake up!

289
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,187
Hey! Hang in there!

290
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,857
Hey!
