ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,468
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,844
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,357
-Are you serious?
-Of course.

5
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:15,028
Maomao came back,
so now's our chance, right?

6
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,785
<i>All done. Unlike the rear palace,</i>

7
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:26,122
<i>there are no good medicinal herbs</i>
<i>in the outer palace.</i>

8
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:28,207
<i>I have to keep growing more bit by bit.</i>

9
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,792
Xiaomao.

10
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,922
Didn't I ask you to clean the office?

11
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,840
Right away, ma'am!

12
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,469
Go easy on the gardening, alright?

13
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,471
<i>She's a tough opponent.</i>

14
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,641
-What does this mean?
-I don't know…

15
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,602
CRYSTAL PAVILION, LIHUA
JADE PAVILION, GYOKUYOU

16
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,271
Excuse me, sir.

17
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,241
You know about the new Pure Concubine
in the Garnet Pavilion, yes?

18
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,158
Yes…

19
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,411
<i>The successor for Concubine Ah-Duo,</i>
<i>who left?</i>

20
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:12,418
The rear palace wants to educate
this new concubine.

21
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,713
They want you to be the instructor.

22
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,215
{\an8}INSTRUCTOR - MAOMAO

23
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,718
You must be joking.

24
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,387
Why would I make such a joke?

25
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,889
Here's the name of the person
who recommended you.

26
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:25,932
Recommended me?

27
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,393
THE PRECIOUS CONCUBINE: GYOKUYOU

28
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,061
And there's another one.

29
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,939
THE WISE CONCUBINE: LIHUA

30
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,024
Lady Lihua…

31
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,989
<i>It must be that…</i>

32
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,032
So, I'm counting on you.

33
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:53,042
<i>I can't ignore the request of</i>
<i>two concubines…</i>

34
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:57,046
<i>They even listed how much I would</i>
<i>get paid.</i>

35
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,217
<i>Grams really ripped them off, huh?</i>

36
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,099
<i>Now's the chance…</i>

37
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:12,270
Are these teaching supplies you'll use
for your lessons?

38
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,398
Yes. And here's the bill.

39
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,443
Just this?

40
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:23,197
The color of the ink is different here.

41
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,450
<i>She's really tough!</i>

42
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,953
<i>With her around, I can't be ripping</i>
<i>off Young Master.</i>

43
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,039
What's inside?

44
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,043
<i>I can't have him seeing my</i>
<i>precious teaching supplies!</i>

45
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,294
Hiss!

46
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,337
Fine, I won't look.

47
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,216
Should I help you carry these?

48
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,509
No thank you.

49
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,679
<i>If I have to do this, I'll go all in!</i>

50
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,351
<i>It's been a while being in</i>
<i>this environment.</i>

51
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,520
<i>The feminine atmosphere calms me.</i>

52
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:58,524
-It's Sir Jinshi!
-He's as beautiful as always.

53
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,363
There are a lot of spectators today.

54
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,325
They probably heard rumors about
the lessons.

55
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,579
Listen up.

56
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,665
The classes are only open
to high-ranking concubines.

57
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,417
If that's not you, step back.

58
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,675
<i>Is this eunuch some kind of</i>
<i>supernatural figure?</i>

59
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,648
You mustn't!

60
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,233
Why?

61
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,195
You said yourself that the lessons are for
high-ranking concubines only.

62
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,030
But…

63
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,157
<i>He's stronger than he looks!</i>

64
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,912
Beyond this point is a top-confidential
secret art only for women!

65
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:04,006
<i>Lady Gyokuyou is as beautiful as ever.</i>

66
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,592
<i>Looks like Ms. Hongniang is</i>
<i>doing well, too.</i>

67
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,012
<i>Lady Lishu seems to be nervous.</i>

68
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:14,434
<i>Well, it can't be helped, with</i>
<i>three other high-ranking concubines here.</i>

69
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,354
<i>As long as the food taster attendant</i>
<i>is there, she should be alright.</i>

70
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,897
<i>Lady Lihua, too.</i>

71
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:24,569
<i>Her rich figure has returned,</i>
<i>and she seems to be doing well.</i>

72
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,989
<i>That attendant is from the</i>
<i>face powder incident…</i>

73
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,366
<i>She doesn't need to be that scared!</i>

74
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,703
<i>Finally, the successor to</i>
<i>Concubine Ah-Duo.</i>

75
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,998
<i>The new Pure Concubine, Concubine Loulan.</i>

76
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,293
<i>Does she prefer those</i>
<i>southern-style flashy clothes?</i>

77
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,421
<i>Her facial features seem more northern,</i>

78
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,548
<i>but I can't really tell…</i>

79
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:52,054
<i>Based on her age, the Emperor will</i>
<i>probably visit her at night.</i>

80
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,933
<i>Looks like the rear palace's balance</i>
<i>will be maintained for now, but…</i>

81
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,979
<i>Whatever. That's not my business.</i>

82
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,734
I'll be your instructor for today.

83
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,861
My name is Maomao.

84
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,406
What I'll be teaching you today

85
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,950
is a secret art to be used
in the garden of women.

86
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,454
Please keep it confidential.

87
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,875
Now, I'll hand out the teaching supplies.

88
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,511
What do you think is going on?

89
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,637
I can't tell…

90
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,598
All done… Huh?

91
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,060
Good work. You took a while.

92
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,146
<i>He must've been eavesdropping.</i>

93
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,691
What's going on?

94
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,570
What happened here?

95
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,030
You gotta change things up, you know?

96
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,199
Touch this like this…

97
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,703
I can't. I can't do it.

98
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,079
Lady Lishu!

99
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,627
I just gave my lesson, like you asked.

100
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,090
<i>Looks like the two recommenders</i>
<i>were satisfied with my lesson.</i>

101
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:03,686
<i>I couldn't tell what she was thinking</i>
<i>to the very end.</i>

102
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,359
<i>Use that any way you'd like.</i>

103
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,778
What kind of lesson was it?

104
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:16,157
You can ask the Emperor
for his opinion later.

105
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,491
Hey!

106
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,468
I'm so tired…

107
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,474
I'm so excited to get paid!

108
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,568
This way!

109
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,537
I'd better not. So cold!

110
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,962
Sir Lakan? Sir Lakan!

111
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,975
Sir Lakan, I looked all over for you!

112
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,606
Does something bother you?

113
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,734
No. It's nothing.

114
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:47,081
<i>What was the commotion last night?</i>

115
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,335
<i>He's a eunuch, but he also has work</i>

116
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,170
<i>for the outer palace, too?</i>

117
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:59,301
<i>Seems like he can't ignore proposed laws,</i>
<i>no matter how silly they are.</i>

118
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,683
<i>It's good paper.</i>
<i>Selling it would make some money.</i>

119
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,351
<i>What a waste to burn these.</i>

120
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:12,314
<i>The garbage incinerator is near</i>
<i>the military base…</i>

121
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,399
Xiaomao.

122
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,360
It's cold outside.

123
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,031
Thank you, sir.

124
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,453
<i>He's watchful, as always.</i>
<i>What a waste that he's just a eunuch.</i>

125
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,626
This is from Sir Jinshi!

126
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,921
I merely handed it to you!

127
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:36,839
I see.

128
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,343
<i>He even needs permission to hand over</i>
<i>one padded gown to a maid?</i>

129
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,803
<i>Must be tough.</i>

130
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,890
Thank you, Sir Jinshi.

131
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,808
Don't worry about it.

132
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,235
<i>The outer palace is several times bigger</i>
<i>than the rear palace,</i>

133
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,446
<i>but I can't find many medicinal herbs.</i>

134
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,700
<i>Looks like the only usable herbs are</i>
<i>dandelions and mugworts,</i>

135
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,161
<i>which I can find anywhere…</i>

136
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,664
<i>It's winter, so plants are hard to find,</i>
<i>but still…</i>

137
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,417
<i>I should plant some seeds around here.</i>

138
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,795
Red spider lily!

139
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,547
Here, and here!

140
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:22,301
The bulbs taste so good when you
soak them in water!

141
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,136
If you mess up removing the poison,

142
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,139
you'll suffer from a stomach ache, but…

143
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,645
Sir Lihaku? His ribbon is a different
color than before…

144
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,271
Did he get promoted?

145
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,650
Oh, hey, miss!

146
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,860
Sir Lihaku.

147
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,112
Are you here with a concubine?

148
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,281
It must be unusual,
leaving the rear palace.

149
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,285
<i>He doesn't know I was fired?</i>

150
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,831
<i>This is Sir Lihaku. He's in love</i>
<i>with Big Sis Pairin, one of the</i>

151
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,750
<i>Three Princesses of the Verdigris House.</i>

152
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,127
<i>He's a loveable idiot,</i>

153
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,089
<i>trying to get promoted for a woman.</i>

154
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,759
<i>To call for Big Sis Pairin,</i>

155
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:07,054
<i>you need about half a year worth of salary</i>
<i>for the common man.</i>

156
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,182
<i>She's too expensive</i>
<i>to call upon frequently.</i>

157
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:14,562
<i>I hear he comes to the Verdigris House</i>
<i>often to have tea with apprentice girls.</i>

158
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,273
<i>But he never ran into her.</i>

159
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,191
<i>Now that he tasted the heavenly syrup,</i>

160
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:22,820
<i>he visits frequently to get</i>
<i>at least one look at her.</i>

161
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,406
<i>He's a hard worker, huh?</i>

162
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,158
-Huh? What's wrong?
-Nothing.

163
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,536
I don't work in the rear palace anymore.

164
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:33,205
I work as an assigned
live-in servant for someone.

165
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,459
An assigned servant?
That person has some strange taste!

166
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,378
I agree with you.

167
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,798
You must be on some business.

168
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,924
Yeah, that's right.

169
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,386
It's a small fire.
Not rare at this time of year.

170
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,431
They don't know the source,
so I'm here to investigate.

171
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,267
<i>A mysterious fire, huh?</i>

172
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,436
<i>The commotion last night</i>
<i>must be from this.</i>

173
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,563
Anyone injured?

174
00:14:57,646 --> 00:15:01,233
Just the warehouse guard.
His life isn't in danger…

175
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,360
Hey, don't get too close.

176
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,486
Got it!

177
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,448
<i>He tells me all that,</i>

178
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,992
<i>and then he tells me not to get involved?</i>

179
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:14,371
<i>The coal reached all the way</i>
<i>to the next room.</i>

180
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,625
<i>The debris</i>
<i>scattered all around the building.</i>

181
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,253
<i>This isn't a fire. It's an explosion.</i>

182
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,506
<i>I see.</i>

183
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,135
<i>So they suspect it might be arson, huh?</i>

184
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,638
<i>Now I know why Sir Lihaku,</i>
<i>and not just some</i>

185
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,265
<i>lowly official, is here to investigate.</i>

186
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,894
<i>If it's just some warehouse,</i>
<i>they may not care.</i>

187
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,146
<i>But this happened in the Emperor's Court.</i>

188
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,984
<i>This country is relatively peaceful,</i>

189
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:48,155
<i>but not everyone is satisfied</i>
<i>with the current state of things.</i>

190
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,742
<i>Foreign troops sometimes attack us,</i>

191
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:55,412
<i>and there have been</i>
<i>some famines and droughts.</i>

192
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,333
<i>We don't know for how long</i>
<i>peace with other nations will continue.</i>

193
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,170
<i>There must be foreign countries</i>
<i>dissatisfied with the status quo.</i>

194
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,343
<i>Is this charcoal? No, it's a burnt potato.</i>
<i>How wasteful.</i>

195
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:14,306
<i>This must be a food storage space, then.</i>

196
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,445
<i>Is this ivory work? Looks like a pipe.</i>

197
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,407
Don't just wander around!

198
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,076
A smoking pipe…

199
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,830
<i>Explosion, food storage warehouse,</i>

200
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,081
<i>a smoking pipe…</i>

201
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,417
Oh…

202
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,544
Hey!

203
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,889
Are you listening?

204
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,142
I can hear you.

205
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,893
<i>But not listening.</i>

206
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,148
Was the burned warehouse
arranged like this room?

207
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,110
Yeah. Looks like the old stuff
goes in the back.

208
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,239
Can I have this?

209
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,324
That's probably fine.

210
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:17,494
Also this. And I'd need a hammer, a saw,

211
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,705
and some nails.

212
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,790
What are you planning on doing?

213
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,251
Just a little experiment.

214
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,466
All set.

215
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,551
You're weirdly good at this.

216
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,972
I grew up a peasant.
I'm good at making things we don't have.

217
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,979
That's flour, right?

218
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,939
Yes. It was in the storage.

219
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,904
Is this good?

220
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,656
And the kindling coal I asked for?

221
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,660
-It's right here.
-Thank you, sir.

222
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,666
What the heck is going on?

223
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,670
We're all ready to go.
It's dangerous, so please step back.

224
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,923
Oh, alright.

225
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,261
Be careful, Sir Lihaku.

226
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,721
What's so dangerous?

227
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,058
No matter what you do, miss,
I'm a soldier. I'll be fine.

228
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,811
Fine. Do what you'd like.

229
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,396
It's dangerous, so be careful.

230
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,941
Run away quickly, alright?

231
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:32,069
What? What do you mean, run?

232
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,033
Erase it right now!

233
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,164
Didn't I tell you?

234
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,587
So, what did what to cause an explosion?

235
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,589
This is the cause.

236
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,842
Flour?

237
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,804
Yes. Powder like flour and buckwheat
is highly flammable,

238
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,099
and when it scatters in the air,
it can catch fire.

239
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,477
And this started the fire.

240
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,396
A smoking pipe?

241
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,567
If you sneak inside for a smoke,

242
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:16,196
<i>the outside air flows inside,</i>
<i>causing the flour to scatter.</i>

243
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,199
<i>If you light the smoking pipe in that</i>
<i>environment…</i>

244
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,746
<i>The flour that filled the entire</i>
<i>warehouse will ignite,</i>

245
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,416
<i>causing an explosion.</i>

246
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:33,463
You should tell the guards
not to smoke inside the warehouse.

247
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,592
How did you even know that?

248
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,721
I've accidentally blown up a room
I was renting in the Verdigris House.

249
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,973
You…

250
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,102
You stupid girl!

251
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,897
<i>Grams was so scary then…</i>

252
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,566
But it's strange to think

253
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,026
that powder can explode.

254
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,279
<i>There are very few strange things</i>
<i>in this world.</i>

255
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,657
<i>If you think it's strange,</i>
<i>it just means you didn't know.</i>

256
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,579
Be careful not to catch a cold.

257
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:09,666
If you do, Luomen's medicines
in the pleasure district will work well.

258
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,961
<i>Old Man is bad at selling.</i>

259
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,505
<i>I have to contribute sometimes.</i>

260
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,010
<i>He can stop by</i>
<i>when he visits Big Sis Pairin.</i>

261
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:24,306
-I'll be going back to work, then.
-Okay.

262
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,604
I brought this by accident.

263
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:35,484
If I clean this up and add a new
mouthpiece, would it work?

264
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,611
It could sell for a good amount of money.

265
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:42,491
<i>This is too nice</i>
<i>for a warehouse guard to own.</i>

266
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,743
<i>Maybe it's something precious.</i>

267
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,205
<i>I should polish this and return it to him.</i>

268
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,338
Shit!

269
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,300
I can do it too… Shit…

270
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:38,982
