ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,718
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,094
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,515
{\an8}No… My Lady is being bestowed?

5
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,145
I understand.

6
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,566
-Lady Fuyou!
-Please wait!

7
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,688
Oh! So cold…

8
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,065
It's been a while
since we came to the capital,

9
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,943
but it's hard to get used to
the chilly mornings.

10
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:34,404
I miss our homeland's sand and sunshine.

11
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,323
The Western Capital was also chilly
in the mornings and evenings.

12
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,033
The Western Capital, huh?

13
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,244
It feels so nostalgic now.

14
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,329
It feels like we arrived just yesterday

15
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,623
for Lady Gyokuyou to enter the court.

16
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:49,419
That reminds me.
Father was pleased in his letter.

17
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,423
Commerce between the Western Capital
and the central area is increasing.

18
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,384
It's because Lady Gyokuyou is loved!

19
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,971
It's the homeland of
the Emperor's favorite.

20
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,640
Even the central area can't ignore that.

21
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,642
Are you cleaning the kitchen?

22
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,977
We'll help too.

23
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,731
We'll never finish unless we split tasks.

24
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,733
We can't ask the other palace women.

25
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,694
Remember when we found
poisoned needles in her clothes?

26
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,780
It was especially bad
when she was pregnant.

27
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:21,284
Part of that may be
because she's a foreign princess.

28
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,996
It'll be okay.
We have a new attendant, remember?

29
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,543
Maomao, what are you making?

30
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,961
Cold medicine.

31
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,838
You can make that?

32
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,799
Our new attendant is talented.

33
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,307
Hey, do you need my help with anything?

34
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,725
Are you eating well?

35
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,227
I am, thank you.

36
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,978
You can always talk to me, all right?

37
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,730
Yes…

38
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,442
Hey, have you heard?

39
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,528
There's a new rumor going around recently.

40
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,613
No.

41
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,199
There's a ghost in the rear palace.

42
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:03,910
A ghost?

43
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,746
I know! It's the white lady ghost!

44
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,082
So it's famous?

45
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,460
All the palace women, eunuchs,
and concubines are talking about it.

46
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,546
It's been about two weeks.

47
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,215
They say a ghost of a white lady

48
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,759
has been seen dancing
in midair under the moon.

49
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,138
It's every night by the castle walls
at the Eastern Gate!

50
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,643
I see.

51
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,814
The castle walls surround
the entire rear palace.

52
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,359
<i>You can only enter and leave</i>
<i>through the gates</i>

53
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,945
of the four directions,
East, West, South and North.

54
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,029
Yeah, right.

55
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,700
<i>There's always guards at the castle gates,</i>

56
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,785
<i>and there's a deep moat outside.</i>

57
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,121
<i>It's impossible to escape or sneak in.</i>

58
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,625
<i>It's said that</i>
<i>buried deep inside the moat are</i>

59
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:00,591
the remains of a concubine
who tried to escape the rear palace…

60
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,970
In other words, a typical ghost story.

61
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,639
What should I do if I see a real ghost?

62
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,225
It's just a rumor.

63
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,064
Excuse me. Will you look at my medicine?

64
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:19,068
Oh, it's you, miss! Give me a second.

65
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,697
<i>It's almost like he was wasn't</i>
<i>suspicious of me just the other day.</i>

66
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,659
<i>Ever since he realized</i>
<i>I can make medicine,</i>

67
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,620
<i>he lets me prepare it.</i>

68
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,248
<i>He even shares with me</i>
<i>the ingredients I need.</i>

69
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,125
<i>He even gives me tea.</i>

70
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,712
<i>Is he allowed to be this laid back?</i>

71
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,089
Sorry for the wait.

72
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,301
Wow!

73
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:46,304
You like salty things more than
sweet things, right?

74
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,264
I'd like some of those too.

75
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,141
Right away!

76
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,355
Thank you for your hard work.

77
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,149
It's not that bad.

78
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,277
<i>Does this guy have nothing to do?</i>

79
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,697
<i>A eunuch should be</i>
<i>at the Domestic Service Department!</i>

80
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,365
<i>Instead, he just wanders around</i>

81
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,868
<i>as if he's keeping watch</i>
<i>over the entire rear palace….</i>

82
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,330
<i>In that case, he's higher up</i>

83
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,624
<i>than the Matron of the Serving Women!</i>

84
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,628
<i>He could be the guardian of the Emperor,</i>

85
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:21,130
<i>but he's too young for that.</i>

86
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,636
<i>He must be the Emperor's lover!</i>

87
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,556
I feel like you're thinking about
something very rude.

88
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,725
You must be imagining it.

89
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:37,605
Doctor, I'm very sorry.
Can you get these for me?

90
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,196
So, what do you want to discuss?

91
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,699
Do you know about the ghost incidents?

92
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,618
I've heard the rumors.

93
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,995
And what about somnambulance?

94
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:56,499
<i>Somnambulance?</i>

95
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,210
So you are interested.

96
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,007
How does one heal that?

97
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,510
I don't know.

98
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,512
It's not something to heal with medicine.

99
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,014
So you can heal it without medicine?

100
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,434
I only work with medicine.

101
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:17,895
I'm at a loss.

102
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,401
I'm truly at a loss.

103
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,906
<i>So annoying! What a stubborn man!</i>

104
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,785
I'll try my best.

105
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,801
<i>He's different from the other eunuchs.</i>

106
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,679
Miss Maomao.

107
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,140
No need for honorifics.

108
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,351
Your position is much higher than mine,
Sir Gaoshun.

109
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,146
In that case, Xiaomao.

110
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,524
<i>Xiao? So now I'm a little girl?</i>

111
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,778
Will you stop regarding Sir Jinshi

112
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,322
as if he's a caterpillar?

113
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,157
<i>Shit! He knows!</i>

114
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,493
Just today, he came back

115
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,204
<i>and told me in a happy state</i>
<i>that you regarded him</i>

116
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,498
<i>as if he were a caterpillar.</i>

117
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,168
I'll be careful from now on.

118
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,965
Anyone without enough practice

119
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,800
could get dizzy and collapse.

120
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,137
<i>People have all kinds of kinks, huh?</i>

121
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,271
Here we are.

122
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,283
A Chinese hibiscus under the moon…

123
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,827
You have a keen eye.

124
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,581
That is Concubine Fuyou,

125
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,042
a mid-ranking concubine

126
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,212
who will be bestowed
to a soldier as a reward next month.

127
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,890
I think it's been two years.

128
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,226
She's a very timid princess.

129
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,852
She's a good dancer,

130
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,272
but made a mistake
performing in front of the Emperor.

131
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,525
She's had no visits from the Emperor
since entering the court,

132
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,610
and stayed shut inside her room.

133
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,906
It's no one's fault, but even so…

134
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,368
<i>-To be bestowed… The poor girl.</i>
-Lady Fuyou!

135
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,915
<i>So the somnambulance is caused by</i>
<i>her agony over being bestowed?</i>

136
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,294
<i>The illness is said to be caused</i>
<i>by a loss of balance in the mind…</i>

137
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,840
<i>No, I need more information.</i>

138
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,717
<i>I'll go see her one more time.</i>

139
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,636
Where is Concubine Fuyou's room?

140
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,389
Her outbuilding is to the north.

141
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,393
Thank you very much.
And for the tea, also.

142
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,520
You're already going?

143
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,400
I hope she cheers up.

144
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:12,028
She's a princess
from a small vassal state.

145
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,946
She may not want to go back.

146
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,407
Go back?

147
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,826
Oh, the thing is…

148
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,913
Poor Concubine Fuyou.

149
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,791
Yes. To be bestowed to a soldier.

150
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,002
Just thinking about it scares me!

151
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,513
She has a very different impression than

152
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,224
when she was dancing on the castle walls.

153
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,267
Yes.

154
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,312
I was surprised myself
when I saw her dance for the first time.

155
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,773
She's usually more simple-looking.

156
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,777
She's really like
a Chinese hibiscus flower.

157
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,905
-A flower?
-Yes.

158
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,449
<i>Chinese hibiscus flowers</i>

159
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:01,327
<i>blossom into a large white flower</i>
<i>in the morning.</i>

160
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,288
<i>However, in the evening,</i>

161
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,500
<i>the color changes into a dark pink color.</i>

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,546
So it's a flower that has many faces
in a single day?

163
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,672
Exactly.

164
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,430
The ghost story?

165
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,683
Yes. I wanted to hear more about it.

166
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,143
Do you know anything?

167
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,063
Now that I think about it,

168
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,525
I heard the ghost appeared first
on the northern side.

169
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,570
-The north?
-Xiaolan? Here's your laundry!

170
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,824
-Coming!
-She moved from the north to the east?

171
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,660
Oh, the thing is…

172
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,580
I see, I thought so.
So Concubine Fuyou is…

173
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:56,173
Old man would tell me
not to act on speculation.

174
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,304
Somnambulance is a mysterious illness.

175
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,807
It's said to be caused by
an unbalanced heart.

176
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,727
A patient acts as if they're awake
even when they're asleep.

177
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,772
Back at the brothel,

178
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,567
there was a courtesan afflicted
by the same illness.

179
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,530
<i>She was a cheerful courtesan</i>
<i>talented at poetry.</i>

180
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:21,657
<i>There were talks of her being bought out.</i>

181
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,953
This offer was eventually rescinded.

182
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,331
She started wandering around the brothel
every night,

183
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,376
as if she were possessed by
a ghost or demon.

184
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,262
Oh. What's wrong, everyone?

185
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,766
The courtesan in question
had no memory of the night at all.

186
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,478
So, what happened?

187
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:54,273
Nothing. She stopped wandering around

188
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,983
when her offer was rescinded.

189
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,694
So you mean that the courtesan didn't

190
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,446
want to get bought out?

191
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,741
Most likely.

192
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,410
The man was a large store owner.

193
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,164
He not only had a wife and kids,
but even grandchildren.

194
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,669
And she only had a year left
in her term of service.

195
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,176
Maybe it's the same with Concubine Fuyou.

196
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,514
Is that really all?

197
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,268
Yes.

198
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,021
Really?

199
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,025
Calm down!

200
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,027
I'm going back to work.

201
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:52,456
<i>After that, Concubine Fuyou</i>
<i>was prohibited from going outdoors.</i>

202
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,251
<i>She was to be guarded by an eunuch</i>

203
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,545
<i>until the day of her bestowment arrived.</i>

204
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,884
I hope this goes well.

205
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,560
Isn't Maomao acting a bit strange
these days?

206
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,687
Is she?

207
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:26,323
I knew it. There's something else to this.

208
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:37,167
Is today Concubine Fuyou's
day of departure?

209
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,837
That's what I heard.

210
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,397
-Hey.
-Huh?

211
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,902
Don't you think you could at least tell me

212
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,361
what the real story is?

213
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,824
I'm the one asking you. I won't get angry.

214
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,663
These are just speculations.

215
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,625
Please don't tell anyone about this.

216
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,418
I'm very tight-lipped.

217
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,883
Do you remember the story of
the courtesan I told everyone?

218
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,219
-The one with the somnambulance?
-Yes.

219
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,933
There was one other courtesan
whose proposal was rescinded

220
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,851
due to the same illness.

221
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,227
That courtesan ended up

222
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:40,856
receiving a new proposal to be bought out,

223
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,359
but because she was a courtesan
with an illness,

224
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,111
the total sum was half the silver
of the original proposal.

225
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,658
But this was all an act.

226
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,493
An act?

227
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,162
The two men who proposed to buy out
the same woman

228
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,705
knew each other.

229
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,708
The woman pretended to be ill

230
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,670
so that the first proposal
would be rescinded.

231
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,422
Later, the man who was truly interested
bought her out

232
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,549
at half the original price.

233
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:12,721
For them to be together,
he didn't have enough silver,

234
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,015
and she still had a long term of service.

235
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:20,062
You're saying Concubine Fuyou is the same
as that courtesan?

236
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,982
The soldier who'll be with Concubine Fuyou

237
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,109
is her childhood friend who grew up

238
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,860
in the same homeland.

239
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,699
I heard that this childhood friend
was praised for his valor

240
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,076
for defeating foreign troops
in the recent battle.

241
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,734
He was offered a reward

242
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,903
and strongly wished for the bestowment
of Concubine Fuyou.

243
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,451
He was probably hoping for this

244
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,870
since he was living in his homeland.

245
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,332
A soldier doesn't have the social
standing to propose to a princess.

246
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:27,296
Even so, she ended up
entering the rear palace…

247
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,341
The princess loved her childhood friend
as well.

248
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,845
<i>That's why she purposefully messed up</i>
<i>her dance</i>

249
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,849
<i>so that the Emperor wouldn't be</i>
<i>interested in her.</i>

250
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,061
<i>As planned, she had no night visits</i>
<i>from the Emperor,</i>

251
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,104
<i>and she remains chaste.</i>

252
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,612
But there was no guarantee that the
Emperor wouldn't prevent Concubine Fuyou

253
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,198
from falling into
the hands of another man.

254
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:57,701
So she pretended to have somnambulance…

255
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,455
That was a possibility with the Emperor.

256
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:02,873
You never know with Him.

257
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,543
The battlegrounds with the foreign troops
are to the east.

258
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,505
And Concubine Fuyou was dancing
every night at…

259
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,007
The Eastern Gate?

260
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,136
She was probably praying
for his safe return.

261
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,347
Though this is just speculation.

262
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,383
-Hey, Maomao.
-Yes.

263
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,886
<i>If I said I feel jealous of</i>
<i>Concubine Fuyou,</i>

264
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,181
would I be a terrible woman?

265
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,026
<i>Concubine Fuyou was beautiful that night.</i>

266
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,033
<i>Almost as if she was a different woman</i>

267
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,703
<i>than the simple princess I saw</i>
<i>during the day.</i>

268
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,877
I don't think that at all.

269
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,989
-Let's go.
-Yes, ma'am.

270
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,847
If love makes a woman beautiful,

271
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,852
what kind of medicine would it be?

272
00:20:56,421 --> 00:21:00,133
We would like to request something
from the rumored apothecary.

273
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:39,191
