ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,301
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,886
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,639
She has no understanding of chastity.

5
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,809
She's a picky eater too!

6
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,646
It's not like she'd die.

7
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,570
{\an8}-So cold!
-The warming stones help a little, but…

8
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:57,575
To have nothing to do
in this cold is torture.

9
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,370
The wind is so chilly!

10
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:05,583
<i>At least have some sort of tent…</i>

11
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,791
<i>This seating is made to foster hostility</i>
<i>among the four concubines.</i>

12
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,550
Look. That lady is the Empress Dowager.

13
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,052
She's very youthful.

14
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,637
She's quite young, actually.

15
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,099
Because she gave birth to the Lord at…

16
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,728
<i>She must've worked hard</i>
<i>to give birth to him!</i>

17
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,899
The Empress Dowager has two children,

18
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,234
the Lord and his younger brother.

19
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,736
But it's rumored that

20
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:19,365
the brother is very ill and can't leave
the house often.

21
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,869
It seems like he was here
until recently, but…

22
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:23,912
I see.

23
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,456
What? You call this plain?

24
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,334
An attendant is to serve her master.

25
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,252
What's the point of dressing up?

26
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,631
Did you hear that?

27
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,716
It's the master who suffers

28
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,427
when her attendant looks poor.

29
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,221
I'm so pissed!

30
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,767
<i>Those attendants are Lady Lihua's…</i>

31
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,813
Oh no, Yinghua's at it.
They started a battle by proxy.

32
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,440
Let's go, Maomao.

33
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,736
She even hired that ugly duckling,
that's to be expected.

34
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,697
<i>Ugly duckling? Is she talking about me?</i>

35
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,242
That is so embarrassing!

36
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,203
What did you say?

37
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,289
-Yinghua!
-Calm down!

38
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,750
<i>They haven't realized?</i>

39
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,045
<i>We were so close at the Crystal Pavilion!</i>

40
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,341
<i>If you get too carried away,</i>
<i>I'll tell Father!</i>

41
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:26,057
<i>Then I'll make sure</i>
<i>you physically can't tell on anyone.</i>

42
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,063
Huh?

43
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,858
<i>It was just a courtesan joke…</i>

44
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:42,031
Apologize to Maomao!

45
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,584
Why are you suddenly all quiet?

46
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,713
I'll leave you alone for now!

47
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,047
-Huh?
-You…

48
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,675
You better be grateful!

49
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,636
What's up with them?

50
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,139
Hey, are you okay, Maomao?

51
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,350
They don't know you're really this cute.

52
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,060
It doesn't bother me.

53
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,771
Do you want to switch warming stones?

54
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,275
<i>Not only did she suffer misfortune,</i>

55
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,778
<i>she even mistrusts men so much</i>
<i>that she dirties her face…</i>

56
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,740
<i>She desperately suffered horrible bullying</i>

57
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,659
<i>at the Crystal Pavilion for two months…</i>

58
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,578
<i>She didn't complain once,</i>

59
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,289
<i>and she doesn't want to worry us…</i>

60
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,502
<i>It makes sense that the kind-hearted</i>
<i>Sir Jinshi watches out for her!</i>

61
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,964
<i>They're making up stories again.</i>

62
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,471
Doesn't she even know her position?

63
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,431
Look at that red clothing!

64
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,225
<i>Another battle by proxy.</i>

65
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,186
It's the Virtuous versus the Pure.

66
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,397
Those two groups don't get along well,
either.

67
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:59,734
<i>The Virtuous Concubine</i>
<i>is very young at 14,</i>

68
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,779
<i>while the Pure Concubine</i>
<i>is a veteran at 35.</i>

69
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,739
<i>Of course they don't get along!</i>

70
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,408
<i>And, they were formerly mother</i>
<i>and daughter-in-law.</i>

71
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,410
Mother and daughter-in-law?

72
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,497
So… This is a bit complicated,

73
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,875
but the two Ladies were originally
the former Emperor's concubine

74
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:19,253
and the current Lord's concubine.

75
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,548
But then, the former Emperor passed away.

76
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,384
The former Emperor's concubine
became a monk,

77
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,180
then came back as
the current Emperor's concubine.

78
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,891
The former Emperor passed away
five years ago.

79
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,645
Concubine Ah-Duo, who was a Lady
at the time, was 30-years-old.

80
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,981
The Virtuous Concubine, Lishu,
was nine at the time.

81
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,235
<i>I know it's politics,</i>
<i>but to be married at nine…</i>

82
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:46,781
Can you believe it?
A nine-year-old mother-in-law.

83
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,617
A nine-year-old mother-in-law…

84
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,829
A mother-in-law?

85
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,665
<i>So…</i>

86
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,917
<i>The one who was concubine</i>
<i>to the former Emperor was…</i>

87
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,128
<i>Lady Lishu?</i>

88
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,772
<i>So that is the young mother-in-law?</i>

89
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,525
I think you've noticed,

90
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,154
but the Virtuous Concubine, Lady Lishu,
is still quite young.

91
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,530
It seems like it.

92
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,951
<i>Traditionally, the Virtuous Concubine</i>
<i>should be wearing white.</i>

93
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,953
<i>But that dark pink color…</i>

94
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:36,998
It clearly overlaps with Lady Gyokuyou,
The Precious Concubine.

95
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:40,084
Maybe she doesn't notice things like that.

96
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,799
The warming stones were a big help.
Please make them again.

97
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,134
Yes, ma'am.

98
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,888
So cold…

99
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,021
If you're cold, you should have these.

100
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,693
Here.

101
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,445
Here.

102
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,079
You're too nice.

103
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:21,125
Asking whether you can share with
the attendants in the Crystal Pavilion.

104
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,212
You even asked for permission
from Lady Gyokuyou.

105
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,463
It's nothing.

106
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,218
A hair clip?

107
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:35,306
That's how they recruit talented people
hidden in the flower garden.

108
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,516
I see.

109
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,185
It can have other meanings though.

110
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,437
I see.

111
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,356
I said, it can have other meanings!

112
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,944
Meanings, huh?

113
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,410
This is for you, miss.

114
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,252
<i>I guess he's giving them out to everyone</i>

115
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,420
<i>so that no attendants are embarrassed.</i>

116
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:10,466
Thanks.

117
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,261
I'm Lihaku.

118
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,679
Nice to meet you!

119
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,932
He's like a big dog.

120
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,225
Woof, woof!

121
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,227
You got that? Show me.

122
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,604
It's a participation prize.

123
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,190
That's not enough, don't you think?

124
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,321
Long time no see.

125
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,323
Long time no see, My Lady.

126
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,207
That's all for now.

127
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,792
Lady Lihua?

128
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,671
Let's go. Goodbye, all.

129
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,260
Lady Gyokuyou…

130
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,346
Might get a little more than upset.

131
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,558
What are you going to do?

132
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,155
Wow.

133
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,868
This is quite impressive.

134
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,080
<i>He must be more higher-up than I imagined.</i>

135
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,958
<i>He fits right in with all the soldiers.</i>

136
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,171
<i>That soldier from before is there too.</i>

137
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:33,716
<i>He's in the last seat. He's young,</i>
<i>so he might have been promoted.</i>

138
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,387
<i>That glittery eunuch isn't here.</i>

139
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,056
<i>But that doesn't matter.</i>

140
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,813
<i>Now, time for poison testing!</i>

141
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,569
<i>No cloudiness to the contact areas.</i>

142
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,698
<i>No strange scents, either.</i>

143
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,412
<i>But a poison tester's job isn't over</i>
<i>until she swallows…</i>

144
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,251
<i>Now rinse my mouth with fresh water…</i>

145
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:25,393
<i>A poison tester's life is expendable.</i>

146
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,188
<i>I'm the only one who tastes poison</i>
<i>for fun.</i>

147
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,690
<i>If possible, I'd love some puffer fish!</i>

148
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:34,443
<i>Sneaking its organs into soup….</i>

149
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,156
<i>The way it tingles my tongue</i>
<i>is irresistible!</i>

150
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,871
<i>Concentrate!</i>

151
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,125
<i>Raw fish and vegetables.</i>
<i>The Emperor's favorite.</i>

152
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,710
<i>It was served at the rear palace</i>
<i>sometimes.</i>

153
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,630
<i>It usually contains blue fish,</i>

154
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,632
<i>but today it's jellyfish.</i>

155
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:59,552
<i>The Food Service in charge of</i>
<i>the Emperor's meals</i>

156
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,138
<i>would never mistake his favorite</i>
<i>ingredient.</i>

157
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,724
<i>Lady Gyokuyou doesn't have any foods</i>
<i>she can't eat.</i>

158
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,145
<i>They must've messed up</i>
<i>the food distribution.</i>

159
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,247
<i>She doesn't like fish?</i>

160
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,668
<i>I guess she can't leave anything uneaten</i>
<i>in front of the Emperor.</i>

161
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,135
<i>I wish I hadn't seen that.</i>

162
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,681
Did you see, Lihaku?

163
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:48,350
That poison tester looks determined.

164
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,895
What's so fun about watching people eat

165
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,230
while fearing for their lives?

166
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,274
Just look!

167
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,652
That poison tester…

168
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,946
It's the girl from before.

169
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,014
How delicious is it?

170
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,692
This is poison.

171
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:48,035
-Poison in the Precious Concubine's soup?
-Is it really poisonous?

172
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,287
The poison tester drank it!

173
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,665
Minister! What are you…?

174
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,668
Formal wear is so uncomfortable…

175
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,422
The Minister drank the soup and collapsed!

176
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,095
Apothecary…

177
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,518
Apothecary!

178
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,896
How do you do, Sir Jinshi?

179
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,232
You're in a great mood.

180
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,903
<i>Oh no, I was excited by the poison.</i>
<i>It's like I smiled at him!</i>

181
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,284
Where are you taking me?

182
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,451
To the medical room.

183
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,206
I spit out the poison.
There's nothing wrong with my body.

184
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,919
<i>I actually wanted to</i>
<i>swallow it right there.</i>

185
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,965
<i>If I had, the poison would be</i>
<i>circulating all around me…</i>

186
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,467
Sir Jinshi, um…

187
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:46,969
What is it?

188
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,471
Please give me the leftover soup!

189
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,183
You're stupid, aren't you?

190
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,061
I'm ambitious, you mean.

191
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,648
After you left,

192
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,027
someone doubted that it was poison,
drank it, and collapsed.

193
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,571
What idiot did such a thing?

194
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,033
The Minister.
Now, people are panicking even more.

195
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:13,120
In that case, use this.

196
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:18,125
It's an antiemetic drug. You can vomit
so much that your stomach turns around.

197
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:19,543
That's a poison on its own.

198
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,670
Hey!

199
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,304
<i>A new hair clip?</i>

200
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,515
<i>So eunuchs get hair clips too?</i>

201
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,936
<i>Now that I think about it,</i>
<i>his collar is disheveled.</i>

202
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,730
<i>He's not as glittery as usual.</i>

203
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:44,234
<i>Is this why I didn't see him</i>
<i>at the banquet?</i>

204
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,739
<i>But now, he looks like</i>
<i>any young man his age…</i>

205
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,327
<i>Actually, he looks quite young.</i>

206
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,082
<i>He looks better this way.</i>

207
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,634
<i>It works! As expected of medicine</i>
<i>from the court doctor!</i>

208
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,178
Are you all right?

209
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,016
Yes. I'm all finished.

210
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,896
Now, tell me what happened.

211
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,441
Who put poison
in Concubine Gyokuyou's food?

212
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,361
I have someone I want you to bring
about that.

213
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,863
Who is it?

214
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:34,034
Will you call Lady Lishu for me?

215
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,455
Sir Jinshi. What did you need from me?

216
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,917
I apologize for calling you
to such an unrefined place.

217
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,587
Who we really wanted was
that attendant there.

218
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,552
The attendant?

219
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,431
Excuse me.

220
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,936
I knew it.

221
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,981
Is it seafood you can't eat?

222
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,111
What is this about?

223
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,906
There are some who can't
eat particular foods.

224
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,326
For me, it's soba noodles.

225
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,662
Even though you eat poison happily?

226
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,456
Leave me alone.

227
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,708
I've tried hard to eat them.

228
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:27,921
<i>But my throat closes up,</i>
<i>and I can't breathe.</i>

229
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,008
<i>Even a little bit gives me a rash.</i>

230
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,803
<i>It's hard to adjust the amount,</i>
<i>and recovery is slow.</i>

231
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,931
That's what "not being able to eat" means.

232
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,810
Lady Lishu. Is your stomach all right?

233
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,104
I can offer you a laxative.

234
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,777
How did you know?

235
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,029
The meal at the garden party was clearly

236
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,157
prepared by the rear palace.

237
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,994
The fish and vegetable dish had
different ingredients than usual.

238
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,996
I think there was an error

239
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,125
and Lady Gyokuyou
and Lady Lishu's meals got mixed up.

240
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,794
I see…

241
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,296
Is it mackerel you can't eat?

242
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,264
This has nothing to do with
being a picky eater.

243
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,142
This time, hives were the only symptom,

244
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,646
but it could cause difficulty breathing.

245
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,816
If you knew this and served it…

246
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,653
It's the same as poisoning someone.

247
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,288
You. You're the poison tester, right?

248
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,166
Yes.

249
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,377
I've gathered things to look out for

250
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,088
in case of emergencies.

251
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,009
Of course, the best bet is
to not eat it at all.

252
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,139
Please look over this.

253
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,310
There's nothing hard about it.

254
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,438
But if you mess up once,

255
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,024
even a physician can't resolve the issue.

256
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,529
This is a life-or-death problem.

257
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,742
Please don't forget that.

258
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,789
<i>That's enough blackmailing.</i>

259
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,675
What is this about?

260
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:42,139
I'm of low class.
Please refrain from touching me.

261
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,017
You're the only one
who says such things to me.

262
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,561
They just don't want you
to feel hurt, that's all.

263
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,192
Now, I must report to Lady Gyokuyou…

264
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,030
Wait. Why did you have the poison tester
be present for that?

265
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,867
What do you mean?

266
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,411
Don't play dumb. You said to call her.

267
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,331
Just so I could inform her of everything.

268
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,834
So you're saying that the servers
simply made a mistake?

269
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,255
That's not for a mere attendant to know.

270
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,928
At least tell me this, all right?

271
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:26,391
The target was the Virtuous Concubine,
Concubine Lishu, right?

272
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,229
If there was no poison in any other plate.

273
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,022
I see…

274
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,582
I'm so tired.

275
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:57,047
Does this have something to do
with the wood tablet incident?

276
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,968
There were no burns
on that attendant just now.

277
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,305
Who could it be…?

278
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,440
