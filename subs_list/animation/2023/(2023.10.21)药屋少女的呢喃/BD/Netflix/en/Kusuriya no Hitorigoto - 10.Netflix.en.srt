ORIGINAL STORY BY: NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,510
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,928
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:57,450
{\an8}I heard that the palace woman
who drowned and died killed herself,

5
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,744
she was the maid for the Garnet Pavilion.

6
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,621
She was the one

7
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:04,874
who poisoned Lady Lishu
at the garden party.

8
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,628
Maybe she did it for her master,
Concubine Ah-Duo.

9
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,588
The Pure Concubine?

10
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,840
Yes.

11
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,675
It was rumored that she'd be removed

12
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,636
from the four ladies
and replaced by a younger concubine.

13
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:22,267
<i>Concubine Ah-Duo, at age 35,</i>
<i>is a year older than the Emperor.</i>

14
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,020
<i>She lost a boy that she had</i>
<i>when the Emperor was still</i>

15
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,438
<i>the Eastern Palace.</i>

16
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:32,652
<i>The rear palace exists to have as many</i>
<i>children as possible. It can't be helped…</i>

17
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,365
<i>A mother of a dead baby boy, huh?</i>

18
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:43,288
<i>If Lady Lihua continues to not have</i>
<i>children, will she have the same fate?</i>

19
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,248
<i>Same with Lady Gyokuyou.</i>

20
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:48,543
<i>You never know for how long</i>
<i>she will be the Emperor's favorite.</i>

21
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,297
<i>Even beautiful flowers will wilt one day.</i>

22
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,800
<i>Flowers of the rear palace</i>
<i>must bear fruit to have value.</i>

23
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,303
I have to go back soon.

24
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,054
Take this, too.

25
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,599
It's leftovers
from the tea party yesterday.

26
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,516
Thank you!

27
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,269
You have so many snacks
that you have leftovers?

28
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,688
Tea parties are amazing!

29
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,857
You think?

30
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,861
<i>Tea parties are duties</i>
<i>that concubines must fulfill.</i>

31
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,946
Maomao, you get ready, too!

32
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,823
<i>There's another one?</i>

33
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,368
Everyone seems to be especially energized.

34
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:24,412
Of course we are.

35
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,581
The Virtuous Concubine,
Lady Lishu, is coming!

36
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,085
<i>The microcosm of the rear palace</i>
<i>can be found in this one room.</i>

37
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,339
Welcome, Concubine Lishu.

38
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,300
Thank you.

39
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,053
<i>Poking at each other's hidden motives.</i>

40
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,723
<i>Is it the fate of all women to be on edge</i>

41
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,059
<i>when facing other women?</i>

42
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,393
<i>Honestly,</i>

43
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:50,021
<i>it's more tense</i>
<i>than when the Emperor comes to visit.</i>

44
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:55,485
<i>Lady Gyokuyou is gathering information</i>
<i>even in a friendly conversation.</i>

45
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,112
<i>She may look gentle,</i>
<i>but she's still a concubine.</i>

46
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,908
<i>She apparently sends</i>
<i>the information she collects back home.</i>

47
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,202
<i>Her home is a resting point for trade,</i>

48
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,371
<i>so it must be important to understand</i>

49
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,997
<i>the flow of people and the times.</i>

50
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,632
<i>The food taster at the garden party?</i>

51
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:20,468
<i>I'm glad she hadn't been punished</i>
<i>that harshly.</i>

52
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,180
<i>I won't bite, you know.</i>

53
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,643
<i>The other attendants aren't</i>
<i>paying attention to their lady at all.</i>

54
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:32,522
<i>But it doesn't seem</i>
<i>that they're bullying her for now.</i>

55
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:37,318
<i>If my report to Sir Gaoshun was a mistake,</i>
<i>then that's great news.</i>

56
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,281
You don't dislike sweets, do you?

57
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:43,199
I love sweets.

58
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,701
I'm glad.

59
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,580
It's cold, so I thought
something like this would be nice.

60
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,001
I brewed citrus peels with honey.

61
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,545
It'll warm you up.

62
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,507
I hope you like it.

63
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,181
<i>Oh? She can't have honey, either?</i>

64
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,350
She's being picky again?

65
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,477
She won't even have what's offered to her?

66
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,187
<i>Twitch, twitch.</i>

67
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:24,907
Lady Gyokuyou.

68
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,785
Oh, my mistake.

69
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,912
I'm sorry, Ailan.

70
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,540
It looks like we need to soak it
a little longer.

71
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,667
I'll offer something else.

72
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,753
Can you have ginger tea?

73
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,214
Yes, I can.

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,842
<i>Unfortunately, it looks like</i>

75
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,511
<i>the bullying rumors were true.</i>

76
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,140
Oh.

77
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,976
Leave the cleaning up to us.

78
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,020
You go rest, Maomao.

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,440
<i>I can clean up, you know.</i>

80
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,443
How was the tea party
with Concubines Gyokuyou and Lishu?

81
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,197
<i>I thought it was weird</i>
<i>to suddenly invite Lady Lishu</i>

82
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,157
<i>for a tea party.</i>

83
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,202
<i>It was his plan all along.</i>

84
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,705
They seemed to enjoy themselves.

85
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,084
We're not finished talking.

86
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,794
Will you let me go?

87
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,965
About the poisoning incident
at the garden party.

88
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:27,095
Did you know that it was done by the
Garnet Pavilion maid that killed herself?

89
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,971
I have heard rumors.

90
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,975
Do you really think she killed herself?

91
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,605
That's not for me to decide.

92
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,857
Why would a mere maid want to

93
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,319
put poison on Lady Lishu
the Virtuous Concubine's plate?

94
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,780
I have no idea.

95
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:56,374
Then, could you go help
at the Garnet Pavilion starting tomorrow?

96
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,001
<i>"Could you?"</i>

97
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,463
<i>He says that,</i>
<i>as if I have any other choice.</i>

98
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,633
Yes, sir.

99
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,262
<i>A pavilion's atmosphere</i>

100
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,264
<i>is determined by its master.</i>

101
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,684
<i>Lady Gyokuyou's Jade Pavilion is homey,</i>
<i>and Lady Lihua's</i>

102
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,310
<i>Crystal Pavilion was</i>

103
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,396
<i>noble and refined.</i>

104
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,899
<i>And the Garnet Pavilion</i>
<i>where Lady Ah-Duo lives is</i>

105
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,819
<i>efficient, elegant, and practical.</i>

106
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,780
Sorry for making you come so suddenly.

107
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,950
I look forward to working with you
for the next three days.

108
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:34,787
<i>I haven't been instructed by Sir Jinshi</i>
<i>to do anything.</i>

109
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,539
<i>Might as well work, then.</i>

110
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,082
I haven't seen you around.

111
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,002
Who are those girls, Fengming?

112
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,171
They're here to help
with the spring cleaning.

113
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,799
I see. Thank you for your work.

114
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,552
<i>The Pure Concubine, Lady Ah-Duo.</i>

115
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,513
<i>She's neither flashy nor plump,</i>

116
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:55,725
<i>but she's both feminine, masculine,</i>
<i>and dignified. She's beautiful.</i>

117
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,060
<i>So she's 35, huh?</i>

118
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,314
<i>If she wore the robe, one could</i>
<i>mistake her for a young civil servant.</i>

119
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,318
<i>She might look better in hufu,</i>

120
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,653
<i>rather than the robe and skirt</i>
<i>for concubines.</i>

121
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,290
<i>Looks like they're into her.</i>

122
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:29,759
<i>She reminds me of someone.</i>

123
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,890
<i>Ms. Fengming, the head lady-in-waiting.</i>

124
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,853
<i>She must come from a good family</i>
<i>based on her position,</i>

125
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,396
<i>but she's very friendly.</i>

126
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,651
First, can you hang these books
out to dry?

127
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,698
If anything is too heavy,
just give it to a eunuch.

128
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,329
<i>As expected of a veteran</i>
<i>high-ranking concubine.</i>

129
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,081
<i>Though the mansion is clean,</i>

130
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,083
<i>it's packed with things.</i>

131
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,921
<i>Similar to the Jade Pavilion,</i>

132
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,549
<i>the Garnet Pavilion attendants</i>
<i>are hard workers.</i>

133
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,301
<i>I'd like to show this to the ladies</i>
<i>who are all talk, no work.</i>

134
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,236
We're finished here.

135
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,613
You already got this much done?

136
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,157
And everything is so neat.
You're a big help.

137
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,160
Can you help at the reception room, too?

138
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,453
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:42,456
<i>She's friendly, observant,</i>
<i>and praises others well.</i>

140
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:47,461
<i>She's skilled in employing others</i>
<i>as the head lady-in-waiting.</i>

141
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:57,722
<i>I haven't done physical labor in a while.</i>
<i>I'm tired.</i>

142
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,312
-Good work. Thank you for helping today.
-Not at all.

143
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:08,024
You're spending the night
at the Garnet Pavilion, right?

144
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,066
Come with me.

145
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,327
<i>A sweet scent?</i>

146
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,205
Use this. It'll be cold tonight.

147
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,624
Thank you, ma'am.

148
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,084
Rest well.

149
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,432
<i>I haven't been told by Sir Jinshi</i>
<i>to do anything,</i>

150
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:42,892
<i>but…</i>

151
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,540
<i>Would I really find the mastermind</i>
<i>behind the poisoning here?</i>

152
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,043
<i>Everyone truly works hard.</i>

153
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,545
<i>Not just the attendants, but…</i>

154
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:12,546
Ms. Fengming!

155
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,257
We can do the wiping down there.

156
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,884
It's all right, it's nothing.

157
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,636
I just noticed it, that's all.

158
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,555
<i>Ms. Fengming is the leader of the pack.</i>

159
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,641
<i>She's past the age to get married,</i>

160
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,851
<i>but if she had,</i>
<i>she would've been a good wife.</i>

161
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,854
<i>Did she not consider getting married?</i>

162
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:33,359
<i>Maybe she chose to dedicate</i>
<i>her whole life to Concubine Ah-Duo.</i>

163
00:11:34,443 --> 00:11:36,278
<i>A strong sense of loyalty</i>

164
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,115
<i>could very well be the motive</i>
<i>for the poisoning.</i>

165
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,743
<i>Now that a new concubine may be coming,</i>

166
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,413
<i>Lady Ah-Duo's position is at the</i>

167
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,414
<i>highest risk.</i>

168
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,417
<i>But what if another seat opens up</i>
<i>before that?</i>

169
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,337
<i>The Emperor only reacts positively</i>
<i>to ripened fruits.</i>

170
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,965
<i>As such, he does not visit Lady Lishu.</i>

171
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,927
<i>This is great news,</i>
<i>considering her age of 14,</i>

172
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,930
<i>but she's also not fulfilling her duties</i>
<i>as a concubine.</i>

173
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,434
<i>If the poison attempt was done</i>
<i>for Concubine Ah-Duo,</i>

174
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,187
<i>Lady Lishu is a reasonable target.</i>

175
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,523
Can someone help here?

176
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:15,901
Honey?

177
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,155
Ms. Fengming's home runs a bee farm.

178
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,909
That's why you have so much
high-quality honey.

179
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,746
<i>So the sweet scent yesterday was honey.</i>

180
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,712
<i>Lady Lishu?</i>

181
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,465
<i>She's only here with the food taster?</i>

182
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>Why is she at the Garnet Pavilion?</i>

183
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,469
<i>Oh, right. At the tea party…</i>

184
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,480
That's all that happened
at the Garnet Pavilion.

185
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:54,940
I see.

186
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:56,859
So?

187
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,862
There's nothing else for me to say.

188
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,032
<i>I don't know what he's looking for,</i>

189
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,867
<i>but I'm just a regular apothecary.</i>

190
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,120
<i>It's not my job to be a spy.</i>

191
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,540
<i>Anyways, isn't he a little too laid back</i>
<i>these days?</i>

192
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,172
Let me rephrase my question.

193
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:22,551
If anyone were to use special methods
to contact the outside,

194
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,511
who would it be?

195
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:26,514
<i>What a mean question.</i>

196
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,808
Someone who could possibly do that is

197
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,770
the head lady-in-waiting, Ms. Fengming.

198
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:33,979
Why do you say that?

199
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,941
She had bandages
wrapped around her left wrist.

200
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,443
<i>The colored wood tablet from before</i>

201
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,947
<i>was wrapped around a woman's robe</i>
<i>with burnt sleeves.</i>

202
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,992
<i>Someone made the effort</i>
<i>to burn different colored flames.</i>

203
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,953
<i>If the flames meant anything,</i>

204
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,120
<i>it would be code.</i>

205
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,914
<i>Honestly, I can't imagine</i>

206
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,375
<i>a calm head lady-in-waiting like that</i>

207
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,544
<i>scheming anything like that, but…</i>

208
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,547
<i>That's only my personal speculation.</i>

209
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,552
I guess you pass.

210
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,721
<i>He took the chance to eat some honey.</i>

211
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,266
<i>I'm sure he knew this much.</i>

212
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,646
I have to give treats to good girls.

213
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,567
-No thank you!
-No need for that.

214
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,282
I don't need it. Do that for someone else.

215
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,244
<i>Just because he's good-looking,</i>
<i>he thinks he'd get away with anything!</i>

216
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,746
<i>That's the kind of pervert he was!</i>

217
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,625
Sir Gaoshun!

218
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,920
<i>I'll poison you with laxatives!</i>

219
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,340
-You don't like sweets?
-I like salt and spice.

220
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,467
But you can eat it, right?

221
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,220
<i>Shit. I can't get through to him.</i>

222
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,806
<i>If he wasn't a higher-up,</i>
<i>I would kick him in the crotch.</i>

223
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,975
<i>No. I can't kick what's not there.</i>

224
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,227
<i>Should I just obey his orders,</i>

225
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,937
<i>or run away and keep my dignity?</i>

226
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,530
<i>Only if this was an aconite syrup…</i>

227
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,036
<i>You don't dislike sweets, do you?</i>

228
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,662
<i>I hope you like it.</i>

229
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,683
<i>Honey?</i>

230
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,644
Ms. Fengming's home

231
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,229
-runs a bee farm.
<i>-Lady Lishu?</i>

232
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,815
Syrup…

233
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:46,612
Honey.

234
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,740
Apothecary?

235
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,910
What are you doing to my lady-in-waiting?

236
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,248
Concubine Gyokuyou, this is…

237
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,709
Whose permission do you have to do that?

238
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,465
Xiaomao,

239
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,635
he just got carried away.

240
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:12,221
Will you forgive Sir Jinshi?

241
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,767
In that case, you should lick him
next time, Sir Gaoshun.

242
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,980
Lick? Well, that's…

243
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,732
Do you get it now?

244
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,570
I have a few things I need to confirm.

245
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,367
Excuse us.

246
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,869
Welcome… Oh?

247
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,789
Sir Jinshi isn't here?

248
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,083
No. Sorry for barging in like this.

249
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:46,046
So? What does a Jade Pavilion attendant
need from me?

250
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,173
I need to ask you something.

251
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,932
<i>You're from the garden party…</i>

252
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,476
What is it?

253
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,604
Do you dislike honey?

254
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,649
How do you know?

255
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,067
It's pretty obvious.

256
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,364
Have you ever had an upset stomach
from consuming honey?

257
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,825
It's common to dislike
a certain food after

258
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,452
experiencing food poisoning.

259
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,038
That's not what happened.

260
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,832
I don't remember. I was just a baby.

261
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,627
<i>I hear my life was at risk at one point.</i>

262
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,631
<i>My wet nurse told me never to eat it.</i>

263
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,218
You're being quite rude.
These are intrusive questions.

264
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,600
<i>You didn't even protect your lady</i>
<i>at the tea party. You're one to talk.</i>

265
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,768
What are those eyes?

266
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,604
You don't need to listen
to an attendant like that.

267
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,899
Yes. It's rude to you, Lady Lishu,
the Pure Concubine.

268
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,233
You should kick her out!

269
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,403
<i>They must make outsiders</i>
<i>out to be the villain this way</i>

270
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,239
<i>to make her think</i>
<i>they're her only friends.</i>

271
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:57,576
-Lady Lishu…
-<i>A sheltered rich girl like her</i>

272
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,578
<i>would easily get tricked.</i>

273
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,372
<i>An isolated concubine</i>

274
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,792
<i>must rely on her attendants.</i>

275
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,586
<i>She doesn't even realize</i>
<i>she's being bullied.</i>

276
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,005
<i>It's a vicious cycle.</i>

277
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,384
I was ordered to come here. If you have

278
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,636
any complaints,

279
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,514
say them directly to Sir Jinshi.

280
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:20,557
To Sir Jinshi?

281
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,184
Directly?

282
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,270
<i>I should be able to get away</i>
<i>with this much.</i>

283
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:30,234
<i>I'm excited to think how these attendants</i>
<i>would approach that pervert eunuch.</i>

284
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,153
Another question for you.

285
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,657
Have you ever met Ms. Fegming,

286
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,452
the head lady-in-waiting
at the Garnet Pavilion?

287
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,470
-Xiaomao?
-Sir Gaoshun,

288
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,557
is there a way to learn about past events
in the rear palace?

289
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,812
I'll look in the court archives.

290
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,816
Thank you, sir.

291
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,824
<i>What did she find out this time?</i>

292
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,951
<i>She's a clever girl.</i>

293
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,287
<i>I can't believe that she's just 17.</i>

294
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,080
<i>She's knowledgeable and calm.</i>

295
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,334
<i>She thinks things through rationally,</i>
<i>and can process information well.</i>

296
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,882
<i>She can be a bit strange,</i>
<i>but also somewhat impressive.</i>

297
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,595
Seventeen years ago,

298
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,431
when the current Emperor was still
the Eastern Palace,

299
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,683
<i>he had a baby boy</i>

300
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,518
<i>with Concubine Ah-Duo.</i>

301
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,604
<i>The boy has since died.</i>

302
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,482
<i>The boy was born around the same time</i>
<i>as the Emperor's brother,</i>

303
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,611
<i>the child of the former Emperor</i>
<i>and the Empress Dowager.</i>

304
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,989
<i>He only had that one child</i>
<i>as the Eastern Palace.</i>

305
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,450
<i>His only concubine was Lady Ah-Duo.</i>

306
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,829
The current Emperor and Lady Ah-Duo
are foster siblings,

307
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:08,832
so I get that he's attached
to Lady Ah-Duo, but…

308
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:13,253
I can't believe that lustful old man
only had one concubine.

309
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:19,968
The baby boy died 16 years ago.
It was investigated by…

310
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,428
LUOMEN

311
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,183
<i>I had imagined</i>

00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,935
<i>that this might be the case.</i>

313
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:31,647
<i>The medicinal herbs growing</i>
<i>in the rear palace</i>

314
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,775
<i>are ones I've been using for a long time.</i>

315
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,694
<i>Someone must have transported them here.</i>

316
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,700
<i>A man who drags his foot</i>
<i>like an old woman.</i>

317
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,912
<i>A man so skilled in medicine</i>
<i>that it's a waste</i>

318
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,956
<i>he's an apothecary</i>
<i>in the pleasure district.</i>

319
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,585
<i>A man with one of his knee bones removed.</i>

320
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,128
<i>A former eunuch.</i>
