ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,676
{\an8}You mean to make Lady Lihua

3
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,720
{\an8}eat such low-class food?

4
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,680
{\an8}It needs to be more luxurious.

5
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,141
{\an8}Otherwise, it won't suit
Lady Lihua's taste.

6
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,853
{\an8}It'd be a disgrace to even
show Lady Lihua this food!

7
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:46,773
{\an8}Does she really think Lady Lihua
would approve of this?

8
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>Oh, god.</i>

9
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,568
<i>So annoying.</i>

10
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,697
<i>I didn't want to come to</i>
<i>the Crystal Pavilion if I could help it…</i>

11
00:01:56,324 --> 00:02:00,787
<i>It was the night that the Emperor</i>
<i>visited the Jade Pavilion…</i>

12
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,770
There is no poison.

13
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,567
I'll be taking my leave.

14
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,027
Wait.

15
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,282
<i>The Emperor spoke to me</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

16
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,660
We would like to request something
from the rumored apothecary.

17
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,330
<i>"Rumored?"</i>
<i>I have a bad feeling about this.</i>

18
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,248
Yes, my lord.

19
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,750
Concubine Lihua's condition is not good.

20
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,919
Can you look after her for a while?

21
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:54,465
<i>By "look after," He means "heal her."</i>

22
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,678
<i>The Emperor's words are words from heaven.</i>

23
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,097
<i>If I refuse, I could be beheaded.</i>

24
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,640
Yes, my lord.

25
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,019
<i>Even so,</i>

26
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:09,355
<i>he doesn't need to say this</i>
<i>in front of another concubine.</i>

27
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,274
<i>It's a reminder that the Emperor</i>

28
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:14,402
<i>is a whole different being than us.</i>

29
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,737
<i>Even so,</i>

30
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,282
<i>to treat someone who arrived here</i>
<i>by the Emperor's orders this poorly…</i>

31
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:21,200
<i>I guess that Lady Lihua's attendants</i>

32
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,703
<i>hate me for working for Lady Gyokuyou</i>

33
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,830
<i>that much.</i>

34
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,167
If you're done cleaning,
hurry up and get out!

35
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:31,753
<i>Boing!</i>

36
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,548
<i>Whatever. I'll remake it again.</i>

37
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,261
Maomao, you're at the Crystal Pavilion?

38
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,889
Yes. I'm looking after Lady Lihua.

39
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:44,015
I see.

40
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,018
She's still not getting any better, huh?

41
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,813
The poison from the face powder
is probably still in her system.

42
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,982
The poisonous powder, right?

43
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:55,526
That powder is now forbidden.

44
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,904
All the remaining powder

45
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,032
in the rear palace was removed
by the eunuchs.

46
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,992
I see. That's good.

47
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:08,081
But a direct request from the Emperor!
You're so amazing, Maomao!

48
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,540
I was really surprised!

49
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,585
<i>Requesting something from a girl like me…</i>

50
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,546
<i>The palace physician must be</i>
<i>that incompetent.</i>

51
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,968
-You're going to the kitchen, right?
-Yeah.

52
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,054
-Good luck on your cooking!
-Thanks.

53
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,059
All right!

54
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,646
<i>After studying Lady Lihua's condition,</i>

55
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,023
<i>I decided to improve upon her diet first.</i>

56
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,318
<i>First, we must remove the remaining poison</i>
<i>in her system.</i>

57
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,196
<i>To do that, we need porridge</i>
<i>with plenty of fiber,</i>

58
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,699
<i>and tea with a diuretic effect.</i>

59
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:45,034
Not this. Nor this.

60
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,746
This one, this one, and this.

61
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,831
Not that one, either.

62
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,294
Cut it out, all right?

63
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,422
This isn't a place where low-class people
can just come and go.

64
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,924
Boing!

65
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,051
This will take a while.

66
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,305
All right, next up…

67
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,140
This one, this one, that and this…

68
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,688
Didn't I tell you?

69
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,566
First, we have to give her
something easy to digest.

70
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,276
She doesn't need peasant food.

71
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:22,405
A patient needs
plenty of nutrients to recover.

72
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,533
<i>So that's what she's always eating?</i>

73
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,161
<i>Yes, it's rich in nutrients,</i>

74
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,539
<i>but it's too heavy for a patient</i>
<i>with a weak stomach.</i>

75
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,167
<i>If they used their head even a little,</i>
<i>they would know.</i>

76
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,169
<i>No one's stopping them?</i>

77
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,590
Lady Lihua, we have your food.

78
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,760
These are all your favorite foods.

79
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,970
Please have even a little bit.

80
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,811
-Lady Lihua?
-What should we do?

81
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,146
Water, quickly!

82
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,606
Are you all right, Lady Lihua?

83
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,734
Lady Lihua, here's some water.
Please drink this.

84
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,862
Huh?

85
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,032
Because a low-class person like you
is in the room…

86
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,701
-The room has bad air!
-Get out!

87
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,288
Boing…

88
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,793
<i>I can't even get close to her like this.</i>

89
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,379
<i>All right, what should I do?</i>

90
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,428
Could I at least examine her?

91
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,888
No need.

92
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,391
What if you worsen her condition?

93
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:37,355
<i>In this state, she'll</i>
<i>definitely get weaker and die.</i>

94
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,732
<i>Humans have to eat to live.</i>

95
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:45,363
<i>She probably lost the will to live</i>
<i>after losing her son.</i>

96
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,496
<i>How long until my neck says goodbye</i>
<i>to my body</i>

97
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,792
<i>for going against</i>
<i>the Emperor's divine orders?</i>

98
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,670
You look like you need help.

99
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,091
Do I look like I need help?

100
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,759
You do, indeed.

101
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,345
Sir Jinshi?

102
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,515
What's up with that woman?

103
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,891
Why her and Sir Jinshi…

104
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,018
Now they've got the wrong idea!

105
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,691
Let's go inside, shall we?

106
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,194
Sir Jinshi!

107
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,781
Going against the Emperor's wishes

108
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,534
goes against intelligent,
beautiful women like you.

109
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,621
Oh my!
We weren't doing anything of the sort…

110
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,082
Exactly. We weren't doing such things…

111
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,586
Women are terrifying.

112
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,845
Now, go.

113
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,211
<i>She has the will to eat.</i>

114
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,673
<i>But she's weaker than I thought.</i>

115
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,300
<i>Maybe rice gruel will work…</i>

116
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,556
Excuse me.

117
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,060
<i>Her skin is the same color as before…</i>

118
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,541
Are you the one applying makeup
to Concubine Lihua?

119
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,543
Yes, I am.

120
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,254
I want her to stay beautiful.

121
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,090
That's the duty of a lady-in-waiting.

122
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,717
It's all for Lady Lihua.

123
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,803
-It's to be expected.
-I see.

124
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:16,931
What are you doing?

125
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,809
Huh? I'm just chastising an idiot.

126
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,105
Ouch! Stop it! It hurts!

127
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,575
The poison will go through your
whole body soon.

128
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,076
Good for you.

129
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,328
Now, you can be just as beautiful.

130
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,748
Just like the Lady Lihua
you admire so much.

131
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,919
Her blood-drained skin, her sunken eyes,

132
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,505
and a body that can't even eat…

133
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,550
Do you even know why this was forbidden?

134
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,551
Do you?

135
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,437
But, I thought…

136
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,565
Lady Lihua would appreciate it…

137
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,775
I'm saying it's poison, damn it!

138
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,611
You don't think at all.

139
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,238
You always think you know best, do you?

140
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:18,034
Who would appreciate poison that
killed their own brat, huh?

141
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,924
Rinse your mouth and wash your face!

142
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,596
You! This is no environment for the ill!

143
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,807
-Hurry up and clean the floor!
-Yes, ma'am!

144
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,436
Wow.

145
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,773
Women really are terrifying, huh?

146
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,946
<i>Did I… really do that?</i>

147
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,531
Let's go.

148
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,871
<i>Lady Lihua's state</i>
<i>was worse than imagined.</i>

149
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,124
<i>First, remake the multigrain porridge</i>
<i>into a gruel,</i>

150
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,502
<i>force her mouth open and pour it in.</i>

151
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,837
<i>Let her swallow slowly, then repeat.</i>

152
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,842
<i>Now's not the time to think about</i>
<i>manners or class.</i>

153
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,721
<i>Ventilating the room</i>
<i>dissipated the scent of incense,</i>

154
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,099
<i>and the room started smelling of illness.</i>

155
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,936
Those useless attendants can't even
wipe down their lady properly?

156
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:29,146
And they call themselves attendants?

157
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,109
If they have time to burn incense,
there are other things to prioritize!

158
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,864
Hey. Bring a tub of hot water and cloth.

159
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,074
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,995
-You help too.
-Yes, ma'am!

161
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,629
<i>Any chance I got, I made her drink tea.</i>

162
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,339
<i>This increased her urination and</i>

163
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,716
<i>got rid of the poison in her body.</i>

164
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,387
I think Lady Lihua doesn't want to…

165
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,097
No. She has to drink.

166
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,517
<i>Once she could eat more in one sitting,</i>

167
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,103
<i>I slowly increased the amount of</i>
<i>rice grains.</i>

168
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,272
<i>Once she could swallow that,</i>

169
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,941
<i>I added soup and grated fruits</i>
<i>to her diet.</i>

170
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,445
<i>I heard later that</i>

171
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,572
<i>the attendant was</i>
<i>placed under house arrest.</i>

172
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,533
<i>The face powder was</i>

173
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,702
<i>something she hid and kept for Lady Lihua.</i>

174
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,372
<i>The eunuch who failed to collect</i>
<i>the powder</i>

175
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,499
<i>was punished by whipping.</i>

176
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,477
You look tired.

177
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,439
Yes. Unlike some people, I'm very busy.

178
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,483
These are for you.

179
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,654
Thank you very much.

180
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,743
<i>He's observant, as always!</i>

181
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,121
<i>People like that will make a good husband.</i>

182
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,498
<i>Even though he's a eunuch.</i>

183
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,918
<i>Compared to him…</i>

184
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:21,050
Do you need help with anything?

185
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,722
What is it? Tell me anything!

186
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,228
We need more people over there.
Can we get someone?

187
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,522
Please complete this
as quickly as possible!

188
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:35,689
Yes, sir!

189
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,734
A steam bath?

190
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,028
She says it's important
to get her to sweat.

191
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,821
Will it work?

192
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,406
I'm sure it will.

193
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,285
We have to use what we can, right?

194
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,260
What is it, ma'am?

195
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,306
Why didn't you…

196
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,061
just let me die like that…?

197
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:19,024
If that's what you want,
you don't have to eat.

198
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,904
You ate the porridge
because you don't want to die.

199
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,842
<i>I see…</i>

200
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,150
You're right…

201
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,532
You are…

202
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,952
My suspension was lifted.

203
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:57,122
I was permitted to serve under Lady Lihua
once again.

204
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:02,544
I'll never make the same mistakes
I made last time.

205
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,631
I'll take over for now.

206
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,549
Please rest for a while.

207
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,260
I see.

208
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,477
Lady Lihua.

209
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,316
Lady Lihua.

210
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:38,163
Will you fetch me some water?

211
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,585
Yes, my lady.

212
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,091
Yes!

213
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,348
<i>After about two months,</i>

214
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,561
<i>Lady Lihua recovered enough</i>
<i>that she could walk on her own.</i>

215
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:07,276
<i>She is proud, but not conceited.</i>
<i>Because of the incidents with</i>

216
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,238
<i>the Eastern Palace, I had thought</i>
<i>that she was a spoiled princess,</i>

217
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,326
<i>but she possessed the qualifying traits</i>
<i>of a concubine.</i>

218
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,948
I'll be taking my leave
early tomorrow morning.

219
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,825
I see.

220
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,036
I have informed

221
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,456
the attendants of what to eat
and what to watch out for.

222
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:09,546
Hey. Do you think that
I can no longer have children?

223
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,591
I don't know.

224
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,302
It would be good to try.

225
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,597
Even if the Emperor no longer visits me?

226
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,559
I came here on the orders of the Emperor.

227
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,687
Once I return to the Jade Pavilion,

228
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:29,191
I think that the Emperor will visit you.

229
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,153
Will a woman who let her own child die

230
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:37,699
without listening to the warnings
win against Concubine Gyokuyou?

231
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:41,745
It's not a matter of winning or losing.

232
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:46,667
The world is filled with hundreds
and thousands of flowers.

233
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,586
It's not right to judge whether

234
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,172
the peony or the balloon flower
is more beautiful.

235
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:57,261
I don't have those jade eyes
or her pale-colored hair.

236
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,809
You can make up for it with other things.

237
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,063
It's not just the size that's impressive.

238
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,357
The tension and the shape are exquisite.

239
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,859
What?

240
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,654
Will you lend me your ear?

241
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,072
Of course.

242
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,298
All right, then. I'll be off.

243
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,387
<i>The "gift" I left for Lady Lihua</i>

244
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,223
<i>is a secret method</i>
<i>that my Big Sisters taught me</i>

245
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,433
<i>back at the brothel.</i>

246
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,437
You remember too, Maomao. It'll help you!

247
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,438
Okay.

248
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:51,648
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

249
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:55,736
<i>I don't have the double fruit required</i>
<i>to pull off such a thing.</i>

250
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,280
<i>But it's the perfect method</i>
<i>for Lady Lihua.</i>

251
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,701
<i>I hope it helps her.</i>

252
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,417
I've returned.

253
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,753
Welcome back.

254
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,255
Are you okay, Maomao?

255
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,549
You've gotten so thin!

256
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,718
It must've been hard work.

257
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,679
<i>Pulling off the Emperor's divine orders</i>
<i>all on her own…</i>

258
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,264
<i>She's impressive, that one.</i>

259
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,771
<i>Later, there was a time when the frequency</i>
<i>of the Emperor's visits</i>

260
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,774
<i>to the Jade Pavilion dropped dramatically.</i>

261
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:39,404
Finally, I can get some sleep!

262
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:45,827
<i>It's not worth mentioning that</i>
<i>Maomao's eyes glazed over.</i>

263
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,970
It's a curse!

264
