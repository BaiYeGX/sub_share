ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,052
<i>Fengxian…</i>

3
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,263
{\an8}<i>I want to be with the daughter</i>
<i>she left behind.</i>

4
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:40,058
{\an8}<i>That was all I wished for.</i>

5
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,145
<i>It can't be helped if she hates me.</i>

6
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:47,482
<i>Even so, I wanted her near me.</i>

7
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:56,574
<i>But I lost the game this time.</i>

8
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,326
<i>I'll let it go for now.</i>

9
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,704
Speaking of, that man…

10
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,956
<i>I can't forgive him.</i>

11
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:06,960
<i>He placed his hand on my daughter's</i>
<i>shoulder three times during the match!</i>

12
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,838
What should I do to get back at him?

13
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,340
So you're finally awake?

14
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,760
You're buying out one of our courtesans.

15
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,179
I'm sure you know that
a couple of thousand silvers

16
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,722
just won't cut it.

17
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,641
Of course I do.

18
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:25,478
If 10,000 silvers aren't enough,
I'll pay 20 or 30.

19
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,814
A hundred thousand may be too much.

20
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,566
I see. In that case,

21
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,153
hurry up and follow me.

22
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,115
Geez.

23
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,516
Even the Three Princesses are taking part?

24
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,227
I said pick whoever you like.

25
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,771
But they won't be cheap.

26
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,566
What should I do?

27
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,736
<i>No matter how well-dressed the courtesan,</i>

28
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,487
<i>they only look like go pieces.</i>

29
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,032
<i>In that case, perhaps I should</i>

30
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:22,911
<i>pay back my debts to Meimei,</i>
<i>who helped me out a lot.</i>

31
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,630
Sir Lakan.

32
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:39,219
I have my pride as a courtesan.

33
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,845
If you desire me,

34
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,014
I will not hesitate to leave with you.

35
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,353
However,

36
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,652
I do hope you're choosing properly.

37
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,293
Meimei! Don't open that
without my permission!

38
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,546
What are you doing!

39
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,676
Wait!

40
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,516
<i>A flower that's beautiful even after</i>
<i>it has wilted.</i>

41
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,938
<i>If that had any sort of message…</i>

42
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,440
Could it be…?

43
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,444
<i>Kitty cat, kitty cat</i>

44
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,449
<i>Cries out wondering where that child is</i>

45
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,953
<i>Where that child is</i>

46
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,790
<i>The little birds</i>

47
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,711
<i>Without knowing anything</i>

48
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,841
<i>Flew away far</i>

49
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,677
<i>Far up the sky</i>

50
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:07,473
<i>Kitty cat, kitty cat</i>

51
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,060
<i>Kitty cat, kitty cat</i>

52
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,898
<i>Good night for now</i>

53
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,068
<i>Until tomorrow</i>

54
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:24,365
What are you doing?
This room is for sick patients!

55
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,908
Get out now!

56
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,369
Go choose a courtesan over there!

57
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,580
Yes.

58
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,832
I have to choose.

59
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,459
Listen to me!

60
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,179
I want this woman.

61
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,223
Don't be stupid!

62
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,769
You're the one who said
that I could pick whoever I want.

63
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,854
I'll pay any price you say.

64
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,899
Be it 100,000, 200,000. Anything.

65
00:05:57,982 --> 00:06:00,026
Don't be stupid!

66
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,977
Let's play go.

67
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,161
I see, that's your move?

68
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,873
Your moves are always so unexpected.

69
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,668
Now I know where Maomao gets it.

70
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,259
Big Sister!

71
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,846
If only you had been honest
from the beginning…

72
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,599
Why didn't you tell him sooner?

73
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:22,108
I'll buy out this courtesan right here.

74
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,280
<i>This woman,</i>

75
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,492
<i>who's as beautiful as balsam.</i>

76
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,712
{\an8}<i>Basen was the one</i>

77
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,381
<i>who accompanied me in taking that man</i>

78
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,757
<i>to the Verdigris House.</i>

79
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,802
I'm tired.

80
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,140
That conniving family…

81
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,769
<i>That's Concubine Loulan.</i>

82
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,190
<i>She must have stayed behind</i>
<i>after the garden party.</i>

83
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,819
<i>That man must be Concubine Loulan's father</i>
<i>who pushed to get his daughter</i>

84
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,362
<i>into the rear palace.</i>

85
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,073
{\an8}<i>But even so,</i>

86
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:16,037
<i>I wish he wouldn't make comments</i>
<i>about a high official right here.</i>

87
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,539
<i>If anyone heard,</i>

88
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,125
<i>they would think I was a part of it.</i>

89
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,753
<i>He's still young, that one.</i>

90
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,712
Hey.

91
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,632
Sir Jinshi is calling for you.

92
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,887
Good work today.

93
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,306
No, it was nothing.

94
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:41,521
-Oh no, you got so skinny!
-I'm all right.

95
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,359
Here, Xiaomao. Eat up!

96
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,779
I'll bring you more!

97
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,870
I thought that you hated the Sir General.

98
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,373
Sir Jinshi.

99
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,209
I don't hate him.

100
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,377
From my end,

101
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,089
it's because of his great aim
that I'm here today.

102
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,258
You had no other way of phrasing that?

103
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,134
I mean, it's true.

104
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,470
I don't know what you thought
had happened,

105
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,765
but a courtesan can't get pregnant
without consenting to it.

106
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,686
They have contraceptives
and abortion pills,

107
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,272
and in the early stages,
they can get abortions.

108
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,525
She gave birth to me
because she wanted to.

109
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,821
I think he was the one who got tricked.

110
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,864
The Sir General was?

111
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,784
Women are cunning creatures.

112
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:40,621
If they can read the cycle of
their blood flow, they can predict

113
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,832
generally when they're most likely
to get pregnant.

114
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,458
If they're courtesans,

115
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,211
they can write letters to adjust
the dates of the visit.

116
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,797
<i>That's why she lost her mind</i>

117
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,384
<i>when her plot did not work out…</i>

118
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:58,431
<i>So much that she did not care</i>
<i>about hurting herself.</i>

119
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,975
<i>And not only that,</i>

120
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,312
<i>she even sent the baby's pinky</i>
<i>along with the letter.</i>

121
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,982
Sir Jinshi.

122
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,442
That man

123
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,695
only spoke to you at your office,
isn't that right?

124
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,614
Now that you mention it…

125
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,908
That man can't recognize people
by their faces.

126
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,077
What do you mean?

127
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,164
He can recognize eye and mouth shapes,

128
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,499
but not all of them together.

129
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,960
He sees all faces as the same.

130
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,839
-That must be difficult for him.
-Yes.

131
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:35,551
My adoptive father who told me
about this said the same thing.

132
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,763
He's had a difficult time.

133
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,641
He has suffered for a long time
because of his condition.

134
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:43,142
I see.

135
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,895
<i>But, for some reason,</i>

136
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,899
he can recognize me
and my adoptive father by our faces.

137
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:54,028
<i>Apparently, he's strangely obsessed</i>
<i>with me for that reason.</i>

138
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:58,199
Sir Jinshi, if that monocled face said,

139
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,702
"Call me Papa," what would you think?

140
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,624
-I'd want to shatter his glasses.
-Right?

141
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,462
He wants to call himself a father,

142
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,298
but he's just a sperm donor.

143
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:20,638
<i>Did that man realize the meaning</i>
<i>of the dead rose?</i>

144
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,100
<i>If he didn't, that's none of my business.</i>

145
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,146
I may dislike him,
but I don't wish him ill will.

146
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:34,026
The only thing I thank him for,
is me becoming Luomen's daughter.

147
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,154
You say that, but you looked like
you hated him a lot.

148
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,908
You don't get it, do you, Sir Jinshi?

149
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,661
When I tried to stop the festivities,

150
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,288
I was helped by that man.

151
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,834
I'm sure he sensed that something
was about to happen.

152
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,627
The Sir General did?

153
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,547
But he didn't know anything at the time.

154
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,884
He doesn't collect proof
and build theories like me.

155
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,429
He senses fishy things
when they're happening

156
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,556
and his senses are rarely wrong.

157
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:11,105
Frustratingly, he's very lazy
and doesn't act on his own.

158
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,569
<i>If that man had openly acted</i>
<i>on his suspicions,</i>

159
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,238
<i>the elixir of immortality</i>
<i>may have been in my hands</i>

160
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,074
<i>at this very moment!</i>

161
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,788
<i>I know that this is only jealousy.</i>

162
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,499
<i>That man is so talented</i>
<i>that Old Man praises him so openly,</i>

163
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,625
<i>and yet,</i>

164
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,587
<i>he doesn't understand the talent</i>
<i>he was blessed with!</i>

165
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,425
We can't make him our friend,

166
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,677
but we shouldn't make him our enemy.

167
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,929
I understand.

168
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,099
What's wrong, sir?

169
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,685
Well… In this world,

170
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,939
there are no fathers who want
to be hated by their children.

171
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,824
<i>A few days after returning</i>
<i>to the rear palace,</i>

172
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,243
<i>I received a small package</i>
<i>from Big Sis Meimei.</i>

173
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,329
<i>Inside was a letter</i>

174
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,624
<i>explaining who bought out who,</i>

175
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,001
<i>and a beautiful piece of fabric.</i>

176
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,878
<i>Listen up, Maomao.</i>

177
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,591
The day I'm bought out,
you'll dance for me, won't you?

178
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,895
<i>I wanted to see Big Sis Meimei off.</i>

179
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,440
<i>That courtesan who is</i>

180
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,109
<i>more beautiful than anyone.</i>

181
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,788
I didn't know I still remembered
all the steps.

182
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,165
Hey!

183
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,804
-What are you doing?
-Sir Jinshi.

184
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:14,056
Why are you here?

185
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,352
I received a report that a strange woman
was climbing the outer walls.

186
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,853
Of course I had to do something!

187
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,523
I thought no one could see me…

188
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,066
That was naive of me.

189
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,152
Don't make me work too hard.

190
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,197
You didn't need to come, Sir Jinshi.

191
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,449
You could've sent someone else.

192
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,495
<i>A kind guard recognized your face</i>

193
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,622
<i>and came to speak with me first.</i>

194
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,125
You think no one notices you,

195
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,710
but that's not true for other people.

196
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,878
-Remember that.
-Yes, sir.

197
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,132
Now, it's my turn to ask the questions.

198
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,299
What were you doing?

199
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,930
In the pleasure district,
whenever a courtesan is bought out,

200
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,850
the other courtesans dance
to send her off.

201
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,478
-What is it?
-Nothing.

202
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,023
I didn't know you could dance.

203
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,070
It was a part of my basic training.

204
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,032
I'm already hearing rumors.

205
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,701
About the eccentric buying out
a courtesan.

206
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,369
I'm sure you have.

207
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,247
He also requested some days off.

208
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,583
He'll be taking a ten-day vacation.

209
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,461
He's causing so much burden on others.

210
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,921
My sister told me in a letter.

211
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:32,342
They'll be having a feast
for seven days and seven nights.

212
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,346
<i>I don't know how much money</i>
<i>he paid to buy her out,</i>

213
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,016
<i>but from the number of those lamps,</i>

214
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,351
<i>it must have been an obscene price.</i>

215
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,353
<i>Even so,</i>

216
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:47,357
<i>the courtesan that was bought out</i>
<i>never makes an appearance.</i>

217
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,529
<i>The allure behind the Verdigris House</i>
<i>increases more and more.</i>

218
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,657
<i>Just as Grams planned, huh?</i>

219
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,160
In the end,

220
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,954
who did Sir General end up buying out?

221
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,457
I have no idea.

222
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,334
I'm sure you know.

223
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,004
No matter how beautiful she was,
she could never beat you, sir.

224
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,547
That's not an answer.

225
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,050
<i>You didn't deny my comment though!</i>

226
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,345
<i>The woman he bought out</i>

227
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,514
<i>won't be in this world for much longer.</i>

228
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,183
<i>When I was at the brothel,</i>

229
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,520
<i>no one ever talked about</i>
<i>the woman who gave birth to me.</i>

230
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,273
<i>I'm sure Grams made sure</i>
<i>no one talked about her.</i>

231
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,234
<i>But talk like that</i>

232
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:33,529
<i>can spread around</i>
<i>from the smallest of slips.</i>

233
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,907
<i>The fact that I'm the reason</i>
<i>that the Verdigris House</i>

234
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,283
<i>almost shut down completely.</i>

235
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:41,662
<i>About the identity of the woman who,</i>

236
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,456
<i>embarrassed of her missing nose,</i>

237
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,791
<i>kept me far away.</i>

238
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,546
<i>That nightmare was something</i>
<i>that happened in real life.</i>

239
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,718
<i>I have no memory of the woman as a mother.</i>

240
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,263
<i>All I have now is a deformed pinky.</i>

241
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,018
<i>It all has nothing to do with me.</i>

242
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,605
<i>I found happiness as Luomen's daughter.</i>

243
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,526
-Sir Jinshi.
-What is it?

244
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,323
Did you know that
fingertips can grow back?

245
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,326
Don't say that now.

246
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,373
What are you doing?

247
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,542
My scar opened up again.

248
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,169
What are you saying?

249
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,881
I think my body got hot because I danced.

250
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:38,385
My sense of pain is dull, I think
because of my drug experiments.

251
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,847
It's all right. I'll stitch it up now.

252
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,099
No!

253
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,060
Sir Jinshi. Let me stitch this.

254
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,312
Don't do it here!

255
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,449
Hey, Sir Jinshi…

256
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,785
Please let me down.

257
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,538
Your scar will get worse!

258
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,625
What if someone sees us?

259
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,502
It's too dark. No one will see.

260
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,131
{\an8}And it's my second time
carrying you like this.

261
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,219
{\an8}<i>Right. The day I passed out</i>
<i>from my injuries…</i>

262
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,387
Sir Jinshi.

263
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,933
I know this might not be the time,

264
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,810
but there's something I've been
meaning to say to you.

265
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,146
What is it? You're being so formal.

266
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,483
{\an8}It's something very important.

267
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,151
{\an8}I have to say it to you.

268
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,202
{\an8}Just say it out loud.

269
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,581
Sir Jinshi…

270
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:58,006
Please give me my calculus bovis.

271
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,057
Don't tell me you never had it!

272
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,892
Hey! Watch your manners!

273
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,144
Geez.

274
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,731
{\an8}<i>A head butt? So immature.</i>

275
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,779
<i>But it feels nicer to talk to him</i>

276
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,906
<i>when he's being a little immature.</i>

277
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:41,633
Wow…

278
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,885
Maomao!

279
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,805
Sir Jinshi is here!

280
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:48,390
Yes, ma'am!

281
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,020
Excuse me.

282
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,317
Are you feeling well?

283
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:03,780
Yes. Everyone takes great care of me
at the Jade Pavilion.

284
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,995
Did you need me for something?

285
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,457
It's nothing.

286
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,835
I just heard something interesting.

287
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,714
I have a favor to ask of you.

288
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,051
<i>Oh, this again?</i>

289
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:32,434
So, what should I do
to assist you this time?

290
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,109
<i>Maomao's story has only just begun.</i>

291
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,114
<i>What sorts of cases would she get</i>
<i>mixed up in this time?</i>

292
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,995
