ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,555
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,640
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,433
{\an8}The scent of sandalwood…

5
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,062
This is Sir Jinshi's bedroom.

6
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,898
Why am I in a place like this?

7
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,574
Oh, you're awake.

8
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,122
Don't push yourself.
You needed 15 stitches.

9
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,583
Sir Jinshi didn't want you to
rest at the medical office,

10
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,585
so he brought you here.

11
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,046
Here you are.

12
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:12,382
Thank you.

13
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,515
I know you've just woken up,
but could you get changed?

14
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,100
I'm going to bring everyone here.

15
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:24,936
I can do that.

16
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,605
What's going on?

17
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,649
Basen!

18
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,945
{\an8}<i>It's understandable.</i>
<i>His master was in danger.</i>

19
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:38,575
{\an8}<i>Though he has no business yelling at me.</i>

20
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,453
I apologize for my appearance.

21
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:45,748
It's fine. More importantly,

22
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,626
explain to us why
you went to that location,

23
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,630
and how you knew the pillar
was going to fall.

24
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,301
Understood, sir.

25
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:01,306
That was an accident caused by
many coincidences.

26
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,476
But it was as if those coincidences
overlapped through someone's design.

27
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,186
That would mean

28
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,564
that it was a planned event,
and not an accident.

29
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,235
The first coincidence was
the death of Sir Kounen,

30
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,571
a high-ranking official
at the Board of Rites.

31
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,493
The second was the warehouse fire,
and the theft

32
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,622
of the ritual items
that occurred simultaneously.

33
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,669
The third coincidence was
the manager of the ritual items

34
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,756
collapsing due to food poisoning
at around the same time.

35
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:42,138
You're saying all those events
were by someone's design?

36
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,098
Perhaps.

37
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,518
Lastly, there is
one more important detail.

38
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,855
-What is it?
-The ritual items that were stolen.

39
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,860
<i>During the festivities, the poles</i>
<i>for the altar are hung by a metal wire</i>

40
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,571
<i>and fixed to a metal fitting on the floor.</i>

41
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,366
If they wanted to design an accident,

42
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,369
they'd target the crucial metal fitting.

43
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,456
If something that important was stolen,
they would remake it for sure!

44
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,209
I'm sure they did.

45
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:16,172
They would add intricate embellishments
appropriate for the festivities.

46
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,967
I had an idea
of who the metalsmith might be.

47
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,886
The goldsmith who passed away?

48
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:27,976
Yes. The stolen metal fitting was
recreated by a goldsmith.

49
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:34,565
If this fitting
was designed to break from heat…

50
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,612
Don't be stupid! It's metal.

51
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,864
It wouldn't
melt at such a low temperature…

52
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,621
Using the secret technique
of the late goldsmith,

53
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,375
it could melt just from being near fire.

54
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:57,714
You're saying the goldsmith was
a part of this plot?

55
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,883
No. He probably knew nothing.

56
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,053
He probably just followed the request
for the commission.

57
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:09,225
<i>"Remake this item using</i>
<i>the special metal."</i>

58
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,727
<i>Or something like that.</i>

59
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,481
An accident happening during festivities,
would make the goldsmith suspicious.

60
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,610
If they got rid of him before that,
the person who commissioned him

61
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,114
and the metal that melts at low
temperatures would all remain a mystery.

62
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,491
It would've been very convenient.

63
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,952
You're saying he was killed.

64
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,538
I don't know.

65
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:34,834
But it could've been murder
made to look like an accident.

66
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,336
The person who

67
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,882
commissioned the late goldsmith
to make this fixture knew about

68
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,468
the secret technique
to make the special metal.

69
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,888
That's all I can say for certain.

70
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,057
Understood.

71
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:53,644
<i>But I never imagined Sir Jinshi</i>
<i>would be at the ceremony.</i>

72
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,523
<i>If the festivities continued as planned…</i>

73
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,152
<i>Who the hell is he?</i>

74
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,821
<i>Someone whose life</i>

75
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,325
<i>could be targeted</i>
<i>in a large-scale plot like this…</i>

76
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,330
<i>Knowing that would only cause</i>
<i>more trouble.</i>

77
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,047
<i>This is out of my hands now.</i>

78
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,351
-Xiaomao.
-Yes, ma'am.

79
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,270
You have a guest.

80
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:39,941
We investigated

81
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,735
and found that a court lady named Suirei
was connected.

82
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,987
<i>I knew it.</i>

83
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,906
Her dead body was found.

84
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,408
What?

85
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,247
<i>By the time the Board of Justice</i>
<i>barged into her room,</i>

86
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,707
<i>she had collapsed from ingesting poison.</i>

87
00:06:57,708 --> 00:07:00,962
The physician performed the autopsy,
and her death was confirmed.

88
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,798
What's going to happen?

89
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,050
They'll keep her in the coffin

90
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,136
and burn her at the stake tomorrow.

91
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,846
And who else was involved?

92
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,932
No one else. Only Suirei.

93
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,187
<i>She performed all of those</i>
<i>detailed tasks on her own?</i>

94
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,566
So, I guess it's case closed.

95
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,692
See you.

96
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,780
<i>She died by being poisoned?</i>

97
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,450
<i>Is this really the end?</i>

98
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,743
<i>And even before that.</i>

99
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:36,581
<i>Is Suirei the type of woman</i>
<i>to kill herself?</i>

100
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,251
<i>Did she have those apathetic</i>
<i>expressions and attitudes</i>

101
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,671
<i>because she knew she had no future?</i>

102
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,383
<i>But it was as if she was challenging me</i>
<i>that one time…</i>

103
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,428
I'm going to plant morning glories here.

104
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,977
Resurrection medicine…

105
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,444
<i>Speculation isn't enough.</i>
<i>I can't say for sure.</i>

106
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,529
Sir Jinshi!

107
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,240
I want to ask you something!

108
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:12,950
What is it?

109
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:21,000
I'd like to speak to the physician
in charge of Suirei's autopsy.

110
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,376
At the morgue.

111
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,545
Why are you laughing?

112
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,298
<i>I lost to my curiosity!</i>

113
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,974
Sir Jinshi, you really
didn't have to come.

114
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,228
If the Apothecary's coming, I'm coming.

115
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,105
I understand.

116
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:52,281
Xiaomao, right this way.

117
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,617
Thank you, sir.

118
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,120
I'm sorry for the wait.

119
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,332
<i>So this physician did the autopsy, huh?</i>

120
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,961
<i>The court lady he was friendly with died,</i>

121
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,755
<i>and she was treated as a criminal.</i>

122
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,215
<i>No wonder he looks tired.</i>

123
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,717
<i>But is that all?</i>

124
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,637
Our question is simple.

125
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,683
Did the poison the court lady took
contain any thornapple?

126
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,685
That is…

127
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,187
The small hill on top of the stable.

128
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,024
<i>Is that where you planted the thornapple?</i>

129
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,027
<i>They are extremely poisonous,</i>

130
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,863
<i>but a small amount of it makes</i>
<i>an effective anesthetic.</i>

131
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,825
<i>I'm sure the medical office is</i>
<i>equipped with them.</i>

132
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,038
<i>Thornapple looks similar to</i>
<i>white morning glories.</i>

133
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,958
I can't say for sure.

134
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:47,003
From her symptoms, it's highly probable,

135
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,337
but I can't say for certain.

136
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,300
In that case, let's check.

137
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,188
What are you doing?!

138
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,191
Stay quiet and watch!

139
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,943
Stop it…

140
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,572
It's open.

141
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,787
It's not Suirei?

142
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,041
No way…

143
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:29,962
It was Suirei! I know it!

144
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,465
Are you certain?

145
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:36,719
I'd never mistake someone else for Suirei.

146
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:41,474
<i>She had no pulse</i>
<i>and her heart wasn't moving.</i>

147
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,226
<i>She was beautiful.</i>

148
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,730
So, you were used as a pawn.

149
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,775
You didn't even think of
cutting into the body

150
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,861
to investigate the specific type
of poison being used.

151
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,822
Suirei predicted that, as well.

152
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,616
You!

153
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:02,161
Suirei didn't just use thornapple.

154
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,164
If you check the inventory number
of the medical office,

155
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,625
you'll know what she used.

156
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,795
<i>The only sin he has committed</i>

157
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,131
<i>is the careless management</i>
<i>of medication inventory.</i>

158
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,674
What's going on?

159
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,803
Why was the dead body switched?

160
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,971
If they're burning the coffin,

161
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,432
people would get suspicious
if it was empty.

162
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:27,436
They probably placed a different dead body
in a new coffin

163
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,562
and swapped them.

164
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,315
Then what about Suirei's body?

165
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,901
It would be difficult to sneak out.

166
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,320
There's no need for that.

167
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,238
What do you mean?

168
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:47,623
Because she walked away on her own.

169
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,584
I thought she was dead!

170
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,004
There's a medication to make it look
as if a person died.

171
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,006
Do you know it?

172
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:59,593
I've heard of it,
but thought it was all fantasy.

173
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:00,970
What is it?

174
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,306
The medication is said to be found
in a distant land.

175
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,519
It kills someone once,
and then brings them back to life.

176
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,230
I'm not sure of the details,

177
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:15,025
but I've heard that
it contains thornapple and pufferfish.

178
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,699
-Xiaomao?
-Sir Gaoshun.

179
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:24,493
Could you look inside the empty coffin?

180
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,661
Yes.

181
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,503
Nail marks.

182
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,091
That's probably where the dead Suirei
was sleeping.

183
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:43,679
<i>And once someone came to help her</i>
<i>and opened the coffin,</i>

184
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,931
<i>she came back to life.</i>

185
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,768
<i>They placed a new coffin</i>
<i>with a different dead body,</i>

186
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,063
<i>disguised themselves as workers, and left.</i>

187
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,611
But there's no certainty that
such a plan would work!

188
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,114
Either way, if she's found,
she'll be executed.

189
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,116
If it were me, I'd bet on that gladly.

190
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,077
You're a special case.

191
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,747
If her dead body isn't here,

192
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,291
it means Suirei won the bet.

193
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:16,837
If this had been after the substitute body
was burned, she would've won the game.

194
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,716
<i>But I won't let her do that…</i>

195
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,054
If she is alive, I'd love to meet her.

196
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,640
<i>Not to catch her.</i>

197
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,893
<i>The knowledge that made all her plots</i>
<i>look like accidents,</i>

198
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,978
<i>and the guts to pull that off.</i>

199
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:37,024
<i>Her toughness that allowed her</i>
<i>to bet on her own life</i>

200
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:39,443
<i>just to trick everyone!</i>

201
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:45,866
{\an8}<i>It wouldn't be fun if a person like that</i>
<i>had died so easily!</i>

202
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,079
<i>The elixir of resurrection!</i>

203
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,623
<i>I'm going to make her tell me</i>
<i>the recipe for sure!</i>

204
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,216
-Excuse me.
-What is it?

205
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:07,846
Could you stitch my legs?
The scar opened up.

206
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,057
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

207
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,439
Lady Loulan.

208
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,626
<i>In the end,</i>
<i>Suirei's case ended in a secret treaty.</i>

209
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,338
<i>There are many unsolved mysteries about</i>

210
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,965
<i>the court lady Suirei.</i>

211
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:48,220
<i>According to the physician,</i>
<i>his mentor was her guardian.</i>

212
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,055
<i>This guardian</i>

213
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,726
<i>saw through her talent a few years ago</i>
<i>and adopted her,</i>

214
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,061
<i>but not much</i>
<i>about her before that is known.</i>

215
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,565
This will be a long case.

216
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,279
I took Xiaomao to her room.

217
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,906
Thanks.

218
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,534
We can't have her
opening up her wounds again.

219
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,286
Yes.

220
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,081
<i>It's not only her injuries we're</i>
<i>worried about.</i>

221
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,043
<i>There's also the case of</i>
<i>the eccentric, Lakan.</i>

222
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,214
<i>It's certain that he is her father.</i>

223
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,468
<i>From the Apothecary's reaction, it seems</i>
<i>their relationship is complicated.</i>

224
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,806
The rear palace is tomorrow, right?

225
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,433
Yes, sir.

226
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:40,648
No issues. It tastes the same as usual.

227
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,442
So, it tastes weird.

228
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,698
You don't have to drink it
if you don't want to.

229
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,868
It's an important gesture as a eunuch.

230
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,289
You probably shouldn't hold your nose
in front of others.

231
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:01,210
-It makes you look much younger.
-I know.

232
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,671
<i>Elegant manners,</i>

233
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:06,465
<i>a smile of a goddess,</i>
<i>a voice as sweet as honey.</i>

234
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,553
<i>A "24-year-old" man who became a eunuch</i>
<i>five years ago, when the rear palace</i>

235
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,430
<i>was passed on to the current emperor.</i>

236
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,057
<i>That is Jinshi.</i>

237
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,978
<i>Ever since I decided to put on</i>
<i>the mask of Jinshi,</i>

238
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,813
<i>I take this medicine every day</i>

239
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,482
<i>to make me "not into a man."</i>

240
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,193
Eventually, you'll become
impotent for real.

241
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,198
And what about you?

242
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,409
My children are all adults.

243
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:36,286
We had another grandchild
just the other day.

244
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,498
Your oldest son had another child?

245
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,250
Yes.

246
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,670
I'm thinking it's time
for my younger son to find a wife.

247
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,340
You mean Basen, right? He's still 19.

248
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,512
Yes, just like you. He's 19.

249
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,307
Even though the eunuch Jinshi is 24.

250
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,520
So you're saying I should find a lover

251
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,690
and finish up this job quickly?

252
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,609
Let me hug my grandchildren, okay?

253
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,112
I'll work hard.

254
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,211
Good day, Sir Jinshi.

255
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,964
Your garments are beautiful, as always.

256
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,508
Thank you, sir.

257
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,929
-Sir Jinshi…
<i>-The Emperor is visiting Concubine Loulan,</i>

258
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,015
<i>but he doesn't seem to desire her.</i>

259
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,143
<i>Concubine Loulan loves fashion</i>

260
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,562
<i>and changes her hairstyle</i>
<i>and makeup often.</i>

261
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,523
<i>This makes her hard to recognize</i>
<i>during visits,</i>

262
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,609
<i>confusing the Emperor.</i>

263
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,696
<i>Even so, He has been visiting her</i>
<i>once every ten days.</i>

264
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,407
<i>Concubine Loulan's father is</i>

265
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,577
<i>chief vassal who was well-liked</i>
<i>by the Empress Dowager.</i>

266
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,954
<i>So, He cannot ignore her completely.</i>

267
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,126
<i>The Emperor has also not shown interest</i>
<i>in Concubine Lishu.</i>

268
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,589
<i>The Emperor was disgusted at</i>
<i>his father's pedophilic tendencies,</i>

269
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,467
<i>and does not plan on</i>
<i>laying his hands on her.</i>

270
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,679
<i>The Empress Dowager, who has</i>
<i>given birth to the current Emperor,</i>

271
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,139
<i>has given birth to another child</i>

272
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,475
<i>a little over a decade later.</i>

273
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,271
<i>The physician did not leave the</i>
<i>Empress Dowager's side during the birth</i>

274
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,775
<i>and the child was born without issues.</i>

275
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,112
<i>However, Concubine Ah-Duo's birth</i>
<i>was disregarded</i>

276
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:36,490
<i>as it overlapped with</i>
<i>the Empress Dowager's birth.</i>

277
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,244
<i>Because of this, Concubine Ah-Duo</i>
<i>lost her uterus</i>

278
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:44,164
<i>and the current Emperor's first prince</i>
<i>died soon after.</i>

279
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,585
<i>If that child was alive now…</i>

280
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,673
<i>That's pointless daydreaming.</i>

281
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:00,013
<i>We must get</i>
<i>the next Eastern Palace right away.</i>

282
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,433
Oh, you're here.

283
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,687
You look very tired.

284
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,731
Come on, you three. Get back to work.

285
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,525
Yes, ma'am.

286
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,194
Actually…

287
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,951
-To the rear palace?
-Yes.

288
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,745
It seems as if her monthly bleeding
has ceased.

289
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:28,709
<i>In other words, she may be pregnant.</i>

290
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,919
When should I go?

291
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,921
Can you go today?

292
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,340
-Yes, sir.
-I'm counting on you.

293
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,761
<i>This is convenient for me.</i>

294
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,306
<i>There are no men allowed</i>
<i>in the rear palace.</i>

295
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:46,560
<i>I have no chance of running into that man</i>
<i>whose name I don't even want to hear.</i>

296
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,689
<i>Could it be that he did this for me</i>
<i>on purpose?</i>

297
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,109
<i>Either way, I'm a food taster again.</i>

298
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,112
Oh, you're in a good mood.

299
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,281
What? That's not true.

300
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,657
How unfortunate.

301
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:04,786
I was happy to have a girl here
that I can train.

302
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,038
Right?

303
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,752
<i>My first time in the rear palace</i>
<i>in a while</i>

304
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,754
<i>has been uneventful.</i>

305
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,048
<i>I'm working as a food taster, like before.</i>

306
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,133
This is safe to eat.

307
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,512
<i>Other than her late period,</i>
<i>there's no way to know if she's pregnant.</i>

308
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,435
<i>I thought this</i>
<i>during Lady Ah-Duo's incident,</i>

309
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,813
<i>but maybe He's not just</i>
<i>some perverted old man.</i>

310
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,696
<i>His trusted advisor, Lady Ah-Duo, left,</i>

311
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,199
<i>and her replacement was an eccentric girl</i>

312
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:46,203
<i>who could even sway the court.</i>

313
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,205
<i>He can't ignore her,</i>

314
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,749
<i>but having a child with her</i>
<i>would cause problems…</i>

315
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,752
<i>It must be quite the headache.</i>

316
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,337
VERDIGRIS HOUSE

317
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,755
Hey, did you hear?

318
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,132
One of the Three Princesses?

319
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,677
Yes! She's being bought out of bondage!

320
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,180
Bought… Out?
