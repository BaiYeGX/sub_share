ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,343
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,928
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,273
A letter from Concubine Gyokuyou?

5
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,568
Yes. I was asked to deliver this
directly to her.

6
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,780
Lady Ah-Duo is currently at a tea party.

7
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,620
I need to talk to you about
something, Ms. Fengming.

8
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,956
All right.

9
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,926
<i>She's packed her things.</i>

10
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,177
<i>So that means…</i>

11
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,720
Here you are.

12
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,855
So, what brings you here today?

13
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,232
We're all set with
the New Year's cleaning.

14
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,942
When are you moving?

15
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,655
You're perceptive.

16
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,242
The New Year's cleaning was just a front
for the real purpose.

17
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,161
Once the New Year arrives,

18
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,872
Concubine Ah-Duo must leave this pavilion

19
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,125
to make space for
the new high-ranking concubine.

20
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,713
Lady Ah-Duo can't have children anymore.

21
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,551
What happened during the birth?

22
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:59,721
I don't think that's relevant to you.

23
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,849
It's not totally irrelevant.

24
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,730
It was my father who attended the birth.

25
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:15,403
The unfortunate thing was that the birth
by Lady Ah-Duo, the concubine for

26
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:19,866
the Eastern Palace, coincided with
the former Empress's delivery date.

27
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,251
The physician hasn't returned yet?

28
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,045
He's still with the Empress.

29
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,048
Lady Ah-Duo!
Lady Ah-Duo, it'll be all right!

30
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,633
Fengming is by your side.

31
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,219
<i>Compared to the Empress,</i>

32
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,888
<i>Lady Ah-Duo's birth was</i>
<i>less of a priority.</i>

33
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,771
Lady Ah-Duo!

34
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,607
<i>That must be when</i>

35
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,651
<i>Lady Ah-Duo lost her uterus.</i>

36
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,197
After that, the child born to Lady Ah-Duo

37
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,032
lost his life at a young age.

38
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,537
Perhaps you feel responsible for
what happened, Ms. Fengming.

39
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,416
You must have been the one
looking after the baby

40
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,503
while Concubine Ah-Duo was unwell.

41
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,883
So you know everything, huh?

42
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,512
You, the daughter of the worthless doctor
who couldn't save Lady Ah-Duo.

43
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,224
That's true.

44
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,225
LUOMEN

45
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,937
They say the baby's cause of death

46
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,482
was the same as
the poisonous face powder from before.

47
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,068
But that's not true, is it?

48
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,197
The "worthless doctor," as you put it,

49
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,783
must have forbidden the use
of the face powder.

50
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,785
Someone as intelligent as you

51
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:48,871
wouldn't let the baby die
from such a thing.

52
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,498
The true cause of death was…

53
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,500
This.

54
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,297
There are many flowers with poison.

55
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,841
Like aconite and azalea.

56
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,051
And its syrup contains poison as well.

57
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,554
I know that.

58
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,266
But you didn't know.

59
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:11,269
<i>You didn't know that regular honey</i>
<i>without any poison,</i>

60
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,605
<i>medicine said to be good for nourishment,</i>

61
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,984
<i>could be poisonous for babies.</i>

62
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,615
Thank you for your help, Fengming.

63
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,744
Not at all. You should rest, Lady Ah-Duo,

64
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,746
and focus on your recovery.

65
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,545
<i>Later, Concubine Ah-Duo's child</i>
<i>passes away.</i>

66
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,841
<i>The cause of death was unknown.</i>

67
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,886
<i>My father Luomen,</i>
<i>a court physician at the time,</i>

68
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,804
<i>was banished from the rear palace</i>

69
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,890
<i>due to his repeated mistakes, including</i>

70
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,683
<i>his treatment during the birth.</i>

71
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,770
After that, by chance,
you happened to learn

72
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,773
the cause of Lady Ah-Duo's child's death.

73
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,987
A certain person told you
that honey is poisonous to babies.

74
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:08,201
You wanted to prevent
Concubine Ah-Duo from learning

75
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,245
that you caused the death
of her only child.

76
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,249
That's why you tried to get rid of them.

77
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,502
That person was…

78
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,464
Concubine Lishu.

79
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,010
During the reign of the former Emperor,

80
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:29,472
<i>Lady Lishu was attached to</i>
<i>the older Lady Ah-Duo.</i>

81
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,016
<i>Lady Ah-Duo also cared deeply for</i>
<i>Lady Lishu.</i>

82
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,269
<i>A young girl who left home</i>

83
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:39,273
<i>and a woman who will no longer</i>
<i>have children.</i>

84
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:43,111
<i>Perhaps there was a type</i>
<i>of codependency forming.</i>

85
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,030
<i>One day, you learn from Lady Lishu</i>

86
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,033
<i>that she ate some honey as a baby</i>
<i>and almost died.</i>

87
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,538
<i>To prevent Lady Ah-Duo from hearing this,</i>

88
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,791
<i>you started to turn Lady Lishu away</i>
<i>from the Garnet Pavillion.</i>

89
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,503
<i>Eventually, the former Emperor died,</i>

90
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,590
<i>and Lady Lishu entered the temple,</i>
<i>not knowing why she was turned away.</i>

91
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,263
You must've been relieved, Ms. Fengming.

92
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:13,766
You thought you'd never
see Lady Lishu again.

93
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,018
<i>But she returned to the rear pavilion.</i>

94
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,605
<i>As another high-ranking concubine.</i>

95
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,233
<i>As someone who would replace</i>
<i>Lady Ah-Duo's position.</i>

96
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,403
<i>The pushy girl continued to visit</i>
<i>Lady Ah-Duo</i>

97
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:29,323
<i>again and again,</i>
<i>as if in search of a mother figure.</i>

98
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,911
<i>To protect the position of Lady Ah-Duo,</i>
<i>who can't have children,</i>

99
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:37,373
<i>and to hide the honey incident,</i>

100
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,835
<i>you placed poison in Lady Lishu's soup.</i>

101
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,549
What is it that you want?

102
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,885
I don't want anything.

103
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,805
I'll get you whatever you'd like.

104
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,608
You know more than anyone
that threats like that are pointless.

105
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:27,173
Have you ever known
the most cherished thing

106
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,634
of the person you most hold dear?

107
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:35,014
Ever since I met Lady Ah-Duo
for the first time,

108
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,601
I knew I wouldn't serve anyone else.

109
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,728
<i>Though she was a woman,</i>

110
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,315
<i>she had a strong will, and could converse</i>
<i>on equal terms with the Eastern Palace.</i>

111
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:48,069
<i>I respected Lady Ah-Duo</i>
<i>from the bottom of my heart.</i>

112
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,321
<i>I was just a girl</i>

113
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,324
<i>who blindly followed her parents</i>
<i>to become a maid.</i>

114
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,785
<i>Meeting her changed my life.</i>

115
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,163
But I…

116
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:04,627
<i>I used these hands to take away</i>
<i>Lady Ah-Duo's most cherished thing…</i>

117
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,712
I did that to her!

118
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,966
The baby that Lady Ah-Duo cherished
like a precious diamond!

119
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,426
With these hands…

120
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,512
<i>Do you know</i>

121
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,390
<i>what Lady Ah-Duo said to us then?</i>

122
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,893
Do not sadden yourselves over this.

123
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,604
A child's life is never certain
until the age of seven.

124
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,191
A small illness can quickly
take their lives.

125
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,445
My son simply followed heaven's orders.

126
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:40,413
Even though I knew Lady Ah-Duo

127
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,499
cried herself to sleep every night!

128
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:55,886
<i>How did she feel as she served</i>
<i>her lady these past 16 years?</i>

129
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,889
<i>Without even having a husband,</i>

130
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,976
<i>she worked tirelessly</i>
<i>for Concubine Ah-Duo…</i>

131
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,313
<i>I would never understand.</i>

132
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,899
<i>I don't have the heart</i>
<i>to care for someone this deeply.</i>

133
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:12,445
<i>If I tell the truth,</i>

134
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,531
<i>Sir Jinshi will capture Ms. Fengming</i>
<i>for sure.</i>

135
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,076
<i>Regardless of the circumstances,</i>
<i>she won't escape the death penalty.</i>

136
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,747
<i>She's intelligent.</i>
<i>She must know all of this.</i>

137
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,627
I have an idea.

138
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,715
The only thing I can do

139
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,801
is to reduce the two motives into one.

140
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,304
The result will be the same.

141
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,308
Please tell me if you will accept.

142
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,780
I'm so tired.

143
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:01,369
I don't have time for a bath.
But I can get changed, at least.

144
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:07,333
I layered some oil paper just in case,

145
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,085
but I'm glad I didn't need it.

146
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,837
Being stabbed is painful.

147
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:19,011
So, Fengming turned herself in.

148
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,012
Do you know anything?

149
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,889
I have no idea what you're talking about.

150
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,101
I heard you had Gaoshun
gather some documents.

151
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,937
Yes. I thought I could learn something,

152
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,772
but it was pointless.

153
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,528
Fengming's motive, as you guessed,
was for Concubine Ah-Duo.

154
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,864
She did it to protect her position
amongst the Four Ladies.

155
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,449
I see.

156
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:45,413
But it's already been decided
that Lady Ah-Duo will step down.

157
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,958
She'll live in a villa in the south
after leaving the rear palace.

158
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,378
Was that decided because of this incident?

159
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:54,463
No. It had been decided for a while.

160
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,467
<i>-It was the Emperor's decision.</i>
<i>-I see.</i>

161
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,679
This flower…

162
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,557
I saw Hongniang decorate those earlier.

163
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,978
Yes. They're blooming out of season.

164
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,531
-It's sweet.
-It's poison.

165
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,327
You won't die. Don't worry.

166
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,999
<i>The proposal I made to Fengming…</i>

167
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,838
<i>The poisoning of Lady Lishu,</i>
<i>and the cause of death of the baby.</i>

168
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,090
<i>If I reduce the two motives into one,</i>

169
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:42,845
<i>Lady Ah-Duo will never know</i>
<i>the cause of her baby's death.</i>

170
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:45,973
<i>Though she cannot prevent her own death…</i>

171
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:50,102
<i>That was the most that I,</i>
<i>a girl with no power at all,</i>

172
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,437
<i>could do in that situation.</i>

173
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,494
I can't sleep…

174
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,456
I'll take a walk.

175
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,188
<i>Fengming's execution was completed.</i>

176
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,900
<i>Tomorrow, Concubine Ah-Duo will leave</i>
<i>the rear palace.</i>

177
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,528
Oh. Looks like it's occupied.

178
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:47,284
You're the maid who came to help
the other day.

179
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,120
-I'll leave right away.
-That's all right.

180
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,207
Won't you have a drink with me?

181
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,167
Alcohol!

182
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,254
Thank you very much, ma'am!

183
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,932
I'm like a man, right?

184
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,018
It looks like you're trying to
act that way.

185
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,188
You're honest, aren't you?

186
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,943
After my son left me, for many years,

187
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:25,322
I wasn't a concubine,
but the Emperor's friend.

188
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,285
No. More like, I went back to
being his friend.

189
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,164
I never imagined I'd become a concubine.

190
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,919
I was just a concubine for decoration,
because he pitied me.

191
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,172
I wanted to hand over my position
as soon as I could.

192
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,302
Why did I obsess over this for so long?

193
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,805
<i>No matter who was with her tonight,</i>

194
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,474
<i>she would've said the same thing.</i>

195
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,774
It must've been cold inside the water.

196
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,944
She must've suffered a lot.

197
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:09,867
I think so.

198
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,453
Stupid, right?

199
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,081
Perhaps.

200
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,460
Everyone. They're so stupid.

201
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,302
That might be true.

202
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,521
<i>I think I know now.</i>

203
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,735
<i>That maid must have killed herself.</i>

204
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,613
<i>Concubine Ah-Duo knew this.</i>

205
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,784
<i>Perhaps Fengming played a part</i>
<i>in her suicide.</i>

206
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,412
<i>The maid who jumped into the cold water</i>

207
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,123
<i>so that Concubine Ah-Duo</i>
<i>wouldn't be suspected.</i>

208
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,001
<i>Fengming, who stepped onto</i>
<i>the gallows willingly</i>

209
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,754
<i>to protect a secret she wanted to keep.</i>

210
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,758
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>what Lady Ah-Duo's wishes are.</i>

211
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:11,387
<i>She has women</i>
<i>who risk their lives for her.</i>

212
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,140
I should climb down soon.

213
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,145
What are you doing?!

214
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,443
Who is it? You surprised me!

215
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,237
Sorry about that.

216
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,824
Sir Jinshi, why are you here?

217
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,284
That's my line.

218
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,287
I'm sorry. I'll get out of the way.

219
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,916
Will you let me go?

220
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,252
Let me go, please.

221
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,796
It's cold. I don't want to.

222
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,174
You'll catch a cold without a coat.

223
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,342
You should go back.

224
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,345
Are you drunk?

225
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,556
It's a part of my job. I have to.

226
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,641
<i>A part of his job, huh?</i>

227
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,561
The head of the house invited me
for a drink,

228
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:04,857
made me drink as much as I could,
then went off somewhere.

229
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,359
<i>When she finally returned,</i>

230
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,113
she said she felt much better,
so I should go home.

231
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:14,700
<i>I didn't know there were people</i>
<i>in this rear palace</i>

232
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,827
<i>who could treat him that way.</i>

233
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,080
<i>But that's neither here nor there.</i>

234
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,250
<i>I don't have the time to be around</i>
<i>this clingy drunkard!</i>

235
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,295
<i>Wait. Now that I think about it,</i>

236
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,673
<i>he caught me because I fell down.</i>

237
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,634
<i>Maybe it's rude to ask him to let go of me</i>

238
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,969
<i>without thanking him first.</i>

239
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,055
Sir Jinshi…

240
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,983
Just a little longer.

241
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:51,945
Warm me for a little bit more.

242
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:12,007
<i>Looks like they're not dealing</i>
<i>with a hangover.</i>

243
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,510
<i>In order to leave the rear palace,</i>

244
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,554
<i>Lady Ah-Duo will hand over her</i>
<i>Pure Concubine crown.</i>

245
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,807
<i>After a while, that crown will be given</i>

246
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,352
<i>to the new girl who will enter the court.</i>

247
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,403
<i>Oh, I see.</i>
<i>I thought she looked like someone.</i>

248
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,532
<i>It was Sir Jinshi.</i>

249
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:41,411
<i>They'd look better</i>
<i>if they swapped clothes…</i>

250
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,413
"Swapped?"

251
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,501
<i>After my son left me, for many years…</i>

252
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,505
<i>After he "left" her? Not "died"?</i>

253
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:55,592
<i>That could be interpreted to mean</i>
<i>that he's still alive.</i>

254
00:18:55,676 --> 00:19:00,264
<i>Lady Ah-Duo's child and the child of</i>
<i>the Empress, born at the time…</i>

255
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,725
<i>What if those two babies were swapped?</i>

256
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,188
<i>Concubine Ah-Duo must've experienced</i>
<i>in her bones that…</i>

257
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,108
What are you doing?
I'm not done with Lady Ah-Duo…

258
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,776
The Empress is the priority!

259
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,695
No!

260
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,572
<i>…She's merely the daughter of a wet nurse.</i>

261
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,658
<i>That rather than the child</i>
<i>of the step-sibling concubine,</i>

262
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,744
<i>the child born to the Empress at the time</i>

263
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,872
<i>would have more protection.</i>

264
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:30,210
<i>Perhaps she couldn't judge</i>
<i>right from wrong at the time.</i>

265
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:35,007
<i>But if her own son would be saved</i>
<i>as a result…</i>

266
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,177
<i>That would have been Lady Ah-Duo's</i>
<i>only wish.</i>

267
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,431
<i>Suppose that it was found out</i>
<i>that the babies were swapped.</i>

268
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,559
<i>If this was after the baby had died,</i>

269
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,771
<i>it would make sense that old man</i>
<i>received corporal punishment</i>

270
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,398
<i>for not noticing the swap.</i>

271
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,905
<i>That would explain why the Emperor's</i>
<i>brother is in an unstable position,</i>

272
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,325
<i>and why the gracious Lady Ah-Duo</i>
<i>stayed in the rear palace</i>

273
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,411
<i>without making efforts to leave…</i>

274
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:10,709
<i>This is all pointless.</i>
<i>It's just a crazy fantasy.</i>

275
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,793
Please wait!

276
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,128
Lady Lishu!

277
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,675
<i>They haven't changed, it seems.</i>

278
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:24,431
<i>For an isolated concubine to have</i>
<i>an attendant she could confide in…</i>

279
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,185
<i>What a relief that must be for them.</i>

280
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,188
Lady Lishu!

281
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:43,909
<i>In that moment, that handsome face</i>
<i>that could pass for a young man</i>

282
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,203
<i>looked like a loving mother's face.</i>

283
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:57,130
These are the names of Fengming's family
and those connected to her.

284
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,760
I heard that she was kidnapped
and sold off, but…

285
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:05,973
