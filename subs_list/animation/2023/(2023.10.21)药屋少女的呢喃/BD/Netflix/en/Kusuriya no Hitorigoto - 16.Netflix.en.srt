ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:31,841
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,759
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,677
{\an8}<i>I'm sorry to bother you with this, but…</i>

5
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:40,141
<i>He always brings annoying work</i>
<i>without asking for permission.</i>

6
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,393
<i>This is very unlike Sir Jinshi.</i>

7
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,606
-What is it?
-The thing is…

8
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:50,819
It's a troublesome affair
happening to a friend of a friend.

9
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:56,825
<i>A court purveyor goldsmith has passed away</i>

10
00:01:56,908 --> 00:02:00,203
<i>without teaching his apprentice sons</i>
<i>his techniques.</i>

11
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:05,834
<i>Some of those techniques</i>
<i>have never been shared with anyone.</i>

12
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,589
So you want me to figure out
the secret technique of the goldsmith.

13
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,717
You say it like it's easy.

14
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:19,139
And you seem more enthusiastic than usual.

15
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,891
Is that so?

16
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,939
The goldsmith had three sons,
who were all his apprentices.

17
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:30,441
One of those sons will be the purveyor

18
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,945
now that the father has passed away.

19
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,823
<i>In their father's will,</i>

20
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,701
<i>he had written down</i>
<i>how his possessions would be split.</i>

21
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,912
<i>The first son will get</i>
<i>the outbuilding studio.</i>

22
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,249
<i>The second son will get furniture</i>
<i>with goldsmith decorations.</i>

23
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,459
<i>The third son will get a goldfish bowl.</i>

24
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,628
And he left behind the words,

25
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:54,215
"You all should have tea together
just like the old times."

26
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,341
That was it.

27
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,302
Tea?

28
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,804
That's got to mean something.

29
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,974
Should we take those words at face value,

30
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,018
or does it mean something else?

31
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,147
Seems like the sons have no idea either.

32
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,151
And there seems to be an imbalance
in how the possessions were split.

33
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:17,822
A shed, furniture, and a goldfish bowl.

34
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,159
The youngest seems to be getting
the short end of the stick.

35
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,662
What type of goldfish can it be?

36
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,124
I haven't heard the details about that.
However…

37
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,795
If you want to know more,
here's the address.

38
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,384
"If you're curious, you should
pay them a visit." That's what he said.

39
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,680
<i>He's prepared.</i>

40
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:46,434
<i>Seems like he knew the whole time</i>
<i>what was about to happen.</i>

41
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,602
<i>How interesting.</i>

42
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,522
Could I take time off
to pay them a visit tomorrow?

43
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:58,404
<i>Looks like I'd get more work</i>
<i>once I'm back.</i>

44
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,036
<i>Oh, is that…</i>

45
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,164
<i>His name was Basen,</i>
<i>if I remember correctly.</i>

46
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:12,377
Just like before,
you're my "personal servant."

47
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,128
Don't move around on your own.

48
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,047
Understood, sir.

49
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,175
<i>Just like before.</i>

50
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,678
<i>He only talks when he needs to.</i>

51
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,638
<i>Seems like he dislikes me.</i>

52
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,059
<i>As long as he doesn't do me any harm,</i>
<i>it's fine.</i>

53
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,401
Yes. Sir Basen, correct?

54
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,611
I was told you are coming.

55
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,496
Oh, that belonged to my father.

56
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,666
He had a hobby of collecting odd things.

57
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,127
I see.

58
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:58,881
-That's the studio?
-Yes.

59
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,467
But we mostly do our work
at the main house.

60
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,721
Now, it's a place
where the workers have tea.

61
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,683
Come in.

62
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,810
Brothers, they're here.

63
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,980
-Hello.
-Thank you for coming.

64
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:16,691
<i>It seems like the boy</i>
<i>that showed us around</i>

65
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,985
<i>is the youngest brother.</i>

66
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,612
The furniture is arranged strangely.

67
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,406
Hey!

68
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,449
<i>He's right.</i>

69
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,909
<i>Having furniture in the middle</i>
<i>like this must be annoying.</i>

70
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,330
<i>But the room doesn't look bad.</i>

71
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,875
<i>Probably because the tables are placed</i>
<i>in a uniform way,</i>

72
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,835
<i>and because the cabinet is decorated.</i>

73
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,259
<i>Goldsmith decorations on the corners.</i>

74
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:47,930
<i>Keyholes on the top three rows,</i>
<i>and the bottom center shelf.</i>

75
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,517
<i>The bottom shelf is decorated</i>
<i>with a different kind of metal.</i>

76
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:56,189
<i>It's fixed to the floor so it can't move?</i>

77
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,232
Hey, that's mine.

78
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:01,486
You can look, but you can't touch.

79
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,990
<i>The furniture was passed on</i>
<i>to the second son.</i>

80
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,286
<i>If that cabinet is one of</i>
<i>the pieces of furniture,</i>

81
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,872
<i>then he must be the second son.</i>

82
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,627
<i>That means this tall man is</i>
<i>the oldest son.</i>

83
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,800
<i>The window is placed oddly too.</i>

84
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,511
<i>A long window in a Western style.</i>

85
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:29,180
<i>This home is made to let in</i>
<i>plenty of sunlight,</i>

86
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:33,392
<i>but the large chestnut tree outside</i>
<i>is blocking the sun.</i>

87
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,395
<i>The light entering here</i>
<i>is filtered through the tree..</i>

88
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,398
<i>This spot is the only area</i>
<i>with enough sunlight.</i>

89
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,111
<i>This mark…</i>

90
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,404
<i>Was something placed here for a long time?</i>

91
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,408
<i>So you'll really figure out</i>
<i>our father's message?</i>

92
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,536
Well, that's…

93
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,712
I couldn't say
until you tell us more details.

94
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,508
You've already heard it all.

95
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:09,137
Our father left us without teaching us
the secret technique.

96
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,598
Instead, he left behind this shed for me.

97
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,685
For me, this cabinet.

98
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,896
And this bowl was for me.

99
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,107
<i>It's made of high-quality glass.</i>

100
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,278
<i>I thought that the goldfish bowl</i>
<i>would be wood or porcelain.</i>

101
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:30,491
<i>In that case, all these possessions</i>
<i>all hold their own value.</i>

102
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:35,538
What was Dad thinking?

103
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,457
He left this behind,

104
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,418
but there's only one key
and it doesn't fit in the hole.

105
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,712
The key doesn't fit?

106
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,132
I think this key is for this
central shelf.

107
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,633
But it doesn't fit.

108
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:52,054
The top three shelves
all open with the same key,

109
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,349
but I can't find the key in question.

110
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,643
What's the point of receiving this
if I can't use it?

111
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,521
Same goes for me.

112
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,525
I have this shed, but I can't
move the cabinet. It's in the way.

113
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,194
Dad caused us a lot of trouble.

114
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,820
I think…

115
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,282
I think Dad wanted us to…

116
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,284
You're lucky, you know?

117
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,412
You received something you can
sell on the spot.

118
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,663
Yeah.

119
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,584
If you sell that, you could live off
of that money for a while.

120
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,295
What was wrong with Dad?

121
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:28,049
What's the point of having tea together
after all this time?

122
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,803
<i>Now, what shall we do?</i>

123
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,306
<i>Looks like the relationship</i>
<i>between the brothers</i>

124
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,059
<i>is quite strained.</i>

125
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,394
Cut it out, you three!

126
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,856
Don't embarrass yourselves
in front of the guests.

127
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,274
I'm so sorry.

128
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,027
I don't know when they became this way.

129
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,947
The two oldest sons
became cynical and bitter,

130
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,950
and the youngest
can't speak up for himself.

131
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,910
This is why my husband

132
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:59,455
worried for them
until his very last breath.

133
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,458
<i>Seems like parents</i>

134
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,753
<i>will always worry for their children,</i>
<i>no matter how old they are.</i>

135
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,342
Please have some tea. Enjoy.

136
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,726
<i>Everyone changed positions to sit down.</i>

137
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,812
<i>They must have designated seats.</i>

138
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:27,358
<i>They probably don't sit in front</i>
<i>of the window out of habit.</i>

139
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,820
<i>There's sunlight coming through the window</i>
<i>at this time of day.</i>

140
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,991
<i>If the light stretched out a bit more,</i>
<i>it might hit the cabinet.</i>

141
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,326
<i>But there was no sun damage</i>
<i>on the cabinet.</i>

142
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,162
<i>Sun damage?</i>

143
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,915
Hey.

144
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:50,006
<i>The sun doesn't hit this area</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

145
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,145
<i>There's something stuffed inside.</i>

146
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,606
Did you figure something out?

147
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,318
<i>I thought he reminded me of someone.</i>

148
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,154
<i>He looks just like Gaoshun!</i>

149
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:17,658
So?

150
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:22,038
The shelf in the middle with the lock
doesn't open, right?

151
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,998
It used to open years ago.

152
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,167
But as Dad added goldsmith decorations,

153
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,044
it got sealed shut.

154
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,421
There's only one key?

155
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,633
Just this one. Dad said

156
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,969
if we break the lock,
whatever's inside will break too.

157
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,306
So I can't force it open.

158
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,686
<i>The three possessions passed</i>
<i>onto the three brothers.</i>

159
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,690
<i>The shed. The cabinet. The goldfish bowl.</i>

160
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,276
<i>The cabinet locked in position</i>
<i>to the shed.</i>

161
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,655
<i>A lock that doesn't open</i>
<i>on the cabinet. Also…</i>

162
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:59,700
"You all should have tea together
just like the old times."

163
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,955
Could it be…?

164
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,549
Excuse me. Could it be
that this goldfish bowl was

165
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,177
decorated on that shelf?

166
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,513
Yes, that's right.

167
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,433
We used to place it here
with a goldfish inside.

168
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,894
It would die if it gets too cold,

169
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,065
so in winter, it was only here
when we had tea, during warm hours.

170
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,900
Around this time of day, actually.

171
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,194
The past few years,

172
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:38,906
we haven't had goldfish,
so it just became a decoration.

173
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,494
Hey, you!

174
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,205
I'm going to go ask for some water.

175
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,874
She's moving around
without permission again.

176
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,133
This is how you added the water back then?

177
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:59,218
Yes.

178
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,554
So that the painting would face this way.

179
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,475
I knew it.

180
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,352
Hey! What is this?

181
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,982
Don't touch it!

182
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,570
I'm sorry. If you look at the light,
you'll go blind.

183
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,864
Also, you're in the way, so please move.

184
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,615
Otherwise, it won't unlock.

185
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,423
The sun hid behind the chestnut tree.

186
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:43,053
It's hot. And it smells strange…

187
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,556
Hey, what's the point of all this?

188
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,310
Please open this shelf
with your key from before.

189
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,314
-I told you, it doesn't open!
-Go ahead.

190
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,363
What does this mean?

191
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,782
Could it be that

192
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,869
your father often had
anemia and stomach pains?

193
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,538
Yes, he did.

194
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,666
What about nausea or depression?

195
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,918
He had those too.

196
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,796
I don't know much about goldsmithing.

197
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,550
Do you use solder in the studio as well?

198
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,801
Yes, we do.

199
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,678
What does this mean?

200
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,889
I only followed your father's wishes

201
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:31,644
to have tea together,
just like the old times.

202
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,690
It's mold to make a key.

203
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,734
Can I remove this from the mold?

204
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,860
Oh… Sure.

205
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,365
<i>It's still a little warm, and soft.</i>

206
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:48,077
<i>The metal stuck inside the keyhole</i>
<i>must have melted from the heat</i>

207
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,163
<i>and poured into the mold below</i>
<i>and hardened.</i>

208
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,590
-It's open!
-What's inside?

209
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,052
What the hell is this?

210
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,763
<i>This blue crystal</i>

211
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,725
<i>is the same one decorated</i>
<i>by the front door.</i>

212
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,063
Damn it! What was the point
of playing nice?

213
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,525
All we did was get pulled into
Dad's little tricks for the last time!

214
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,693
So sick of this.

215
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,571
Lead and tin?

216
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,740
<i>"Skills should be acquired by observing."</i>

217
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:29,827
<i>A craftsman client used to say this often.</i>

218
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,329
<i>I took those words to heart</i>

219
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,791
<i>and infused Old Man's medicinal herbs</i>
<i>by copying him</i>

220
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,668
<i>and poisoned myself.</i>

221
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,920
Listen before watching, all right?

222
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,089
<i>That's what he said to me then.</i>

223
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:45,926
<i>Only the youngest son</i>
<i>understood his late father's message,</i>

224
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,094
<i>it seems.</i>

225
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:51,724
<i>Solder melts at a lower temperature</i>
<i>than its original metals</i>

226
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:55,853
<i>when it is mixed with</i>
<i>various types of metal.</i>

227
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,857
<i>Out of the three metal chunks,</i>
<i>two are lead and tin.</i>

228
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,277
<i>What if combining a third type of metal</i>

229
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,113
<i>could create a whole new metal?</i>

230
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:10,618
<i>Despite being exposed to the heat of</i>
<i>the light aggregated by the bowl,</i>

231
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,829
<i>it wasn't exposed to the heat for long.</i>

232
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,624
<i>That means the melting point is that low.</i>

233
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:22,129
<i>The different sizes of the shelves</i>
<i>may be indicating the mixing ratio.</i>

234
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,883
<i>But that's not for me to say.</i>

235
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,345
What kind of will is this? Let's go.

236
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,347
I shouldn't have expected anything of Dad.

237
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,724
Wait, Brothers!

238
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:37,061
-What?
-These aren't tricks.

239
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,438
So what is it, then?

240
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,815
Dad wanted us to be close again.

241
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,487
That's why he left behind this message!

242
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,281
-What?
-That's why…

243
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,911
I want to continue working with you both!

244
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,460
You want to work with us?

245
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,882
Don't make us laugh. We're not like you.

246
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,176
You have talent.

247
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,346
That's why Dad doted on you.

248
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,265
That's not true!

249
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,727
Dad trusted you two.

250
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:21,480
Dad always used to say to me,

251
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,733
<i>Brother Chan is always calm,</i>

252
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,027
<i>and is always accurate with detailed work.</i>

253
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,531
Because you don't make mistakes,
he can trust you with any task.

254
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,283
Brother Tsu is good at
capturing people's hearts.

255
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,079
<i>Being able to become friends with anyone</i>

256
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:40,582
is a skill that you should be proud of.

257
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,963
<i>Dad regarded us all in the same way.</i>

258
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,515
That's what I think, at least.

259
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,604
-Excuse us.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

260
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,524
<i>A father, huh?</i>

261
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,819
<i>I wouldn't know anything about that.</i>

262
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,405
Thank you very much!

263
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,325
<i>I'll just leave them with this.</i>

264
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,660
Hey!

265
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,081
In The Verdigris House
at the pleasure district,

266
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,459
there is an apothecary named Luomen.

267
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,627
He's a very skilled doctor as well.

268
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,298
Please give him a visit
if you're not feeling well.

269
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,758
Yes, I will.

270
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:47,608
Thank you for your help the other day.

271
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,820
It was very interesting.

272
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,489
It seems as if

273
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:57,367
the youngest was the most capable
out of the three brothers.

274
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,163
<i>You must've known that, Sir General.</i>

275
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:06,418
The youngest became
even more skilled after that affair.

276
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:10,881
He'll become the successor
and create metalworks for the court.

277
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,425
And the two eldest

278
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,471
will no longer work as craftsmen
after this incident.

279
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,976
-Why is that?
-It's nothing bad.

280
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,063
They took their
late father's words to heart,

281
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,689
<i>it looks like.</i>

282
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,442
<i>The eldest will manage sales.</i>

283
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112
<i>The second son will be the salesman.</i>

284
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:38,951
<i>They'll continue to support</i>
<i>the family business in different ways.</i>

285
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,619
In other words,

286
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:44,039
they all settled down in roles
they're suited for.

287
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,128
<i>I don't know what happened</i>
<i>in that mansion.</i>

288
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,799
<i>I'm sure the Apothecary knows,</i>
<i>and will keep quiet.</i>

289
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:57,803
The late goldsmith's work
was really magnificent.

290
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,722
<i>It was a simple metal fitting,</i>

291
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,058
<i>but using that as decoration</i>
<i>for ritual goods</i>

292
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,561
will be beautiful.

293
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,939
That's true.

294
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,108
<i>What an unlikeable man.</i>

295
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:16,196
<i>He knows that ritual goods</i>
<i>have nothing to do with my position.</i>

296
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,700
-Why did you, Sir General…
-It's nothing.

297
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:24,872
I just felt it was a waste
to neglect a hidden talent like that.

298
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,540
It doesn't matter who's older.

299
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:31,253
We should recognize great talents.

300
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,798
<i>He's right.</i>

301
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,967
<i>Lakan is a sleazy man,</i>

302
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,219
<i>but he's good at finding people's talent.</i>

303
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,765
<i>That power got him</i>
<i>to the position he is in now.</i>

304
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,518
Speaking of,

305
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,105
I'd like to hear more
of what you discussed before.

306
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,649
What do you mean?

307
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,987
The story about the courtesan.

308
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:01,783
Oh, you mean, how to decrease
the scarcity value of a courtesan?

309
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,163
You should ask

310
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,041
someone who's well-versed in that world.

311
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,962
Oh, it's already time.

312
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:16,840
My men will yell at me
if I stay for too long.

313
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,016
Please give this
to your live-in maidservants.

314
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,853
It's not too sweet. It's easy to drink.

315
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,522
I'll see you tomorrow!

316
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,657
-Sir Jinshi.
-Yeah?

317
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,534
I'm sorry to bother you after a long day.

318
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,832
Did you call for me?

319
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,710
Do you know much about makeup?

320
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,756
I have the basic skills.

321
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,551
In that case… Will you put makeup on me?

322
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,973
What?

323
