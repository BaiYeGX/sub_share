00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,759
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,385
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,236
Oh, right. I'm home.

5
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,827
My hair's so sticky…

6
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,037
Old man must be…

7
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,706
At the farm.

8
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,049
<i>He's not young,</i>

9
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,760
<i>so I'd like him to</i>
<i>stop working at the farm…</i>

10
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:20,765
But he sure loves making medicine out of
herbs he grew himself,

11
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,724
that old man.

12
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,564
You'll break it.

13
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,485
I don't know you.
Are you an outside apprentice?

14
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,237
-The old man…
-Come!

15
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,580
Big Sis!

16
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,456
I brought the apothecary!

17
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,167
-Quickly!
<i>-This smell…!</i>

18
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,758
Ms. Apothecary!
I made them vomit it out, but…

19
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,096
Not yet!

20
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:02,974
He's not breathing.

21
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,184
Her breath is weak too.

22
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,062
I'll check whether there's any vomit
in his throat.

23
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,189
-You check her.
-Yes!

24
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,527
<i>He has no pulse.</i>
<i>Nothing in his throat, either.</i>

25
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,702
<i>Just saliva.</i>

26
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,090
Bring some water!

27
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,051
Don't make them drink water!

28
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,510
Charcoal. Bring some charcoal!

29
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,304
Yes, ma'am!

30
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,483
What is all this, so early in the morning?

31
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,611
I want to take a bath…

32
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,490
Thank you, Ms. Apothecary.
They're both stable now.

33
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,952
-Oh, leave that.
-Even the vomit?

34
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,789
-There might be poison left over.
-Poison…

35
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,125
I'll prepare some tea.

36
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,636
<i>The sick people were a courtesan</i>
<i>and her customer.</i>

37
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,973
<i>The room was filled with the scent</i>
<i>of alcohol and tobacco.</i>

38
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,226
<i>Two liquor bottles.</i>

39
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,728
<i>Shattered glass cups.</i>

40
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,190
<i>Is this… wheat stalk?</i>

41
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,777
<i>A smoking pipe, and tobacco leaves.</i>

42
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,281
What an elaborate act this is.

43
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,908
Here's some charcoal.

44
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,494
Can you bring a wood tablet
and something to write with?

45
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,412
What?

46
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,916
The old man should be at the farm

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,835
by the southern outer walls.

48
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,003
Can you bring him too?

49
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,754
I got it.

50
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,767
You're late, old man.

51
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,645
This girl was concerned for my legs.

52
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,480
I crushed the charcoal.

53
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,985
I'll mix it with the herbs
and have them take it right away.

54
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,029
Can you drink this?

55
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,115
And him?

56
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,909
He's okay. He took the medicine.

57
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,580
I guess your treatment was all right.

58
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,290
Just "all right"?

59
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,961
<i>Old man is someone who can learn</i>
<i>two or three things</i>

60
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,964
<i>out of a single piece of information.</i>

61
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,342
What poison did you think this was?

62
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,302
<i>Here it comes!</i>

63
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,396
<i>Old man tries to teach me lessons</i>
<i>like this sometimes.</i>

64
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,566
Tobacco leaves are poisonous.

65
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,402
This is what they'd use
for a suicide pact.

66
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,155
I hear you didn't make them drink water.

67
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,449
That would have reverse effects.

68
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,492
That's true.

69
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,411
Gastric fluid can prevent
the absorption of poison,

70
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,413
so in that case, water wouldn't help.

71
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:17,210
But what if this was dissolved in water
in the first place?

72
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,923
<i>There are no leaves in the vomit!</i>

73
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:25,176
<i>I missed it. Am I still half-asleep?</i>

74
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,971
<i>If the poison was dissolved in water,</i>
<i>it's better to dilute it.</i>

75
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,224
<i>All right. Now I know.</i>

76
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,436
I'm sorry about this.

77
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,189
<i>Offering tea sweets reserved for guests?</i>

78
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,941
<i>They're quite generous.</i>

79
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,820
<i>I see.</i>

80
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:47,323
<i>They use this to prevent lipstick stains</i>
<i>on the cups.</i>

81
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,077
You really helped us a lot.

82
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,496
This is a mere token, but…

83
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,124
-No, I can't accept that…
-Old man.

84
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,960
Can you afford rent to Grams this month?

85
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,169
I happily accept.

86
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,963
<i>Geez. This old man…</i>

87
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,677
<i>This instance was</i>

88
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,471
<i>a classic case of a suicide pact.</i>
<i>Not uncommon here.</i>

89
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,723
<i>A woman with a long term of service</i>

90
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,809
<i>and a man</i>
<i>that can't afford to buy her out.</i>

91
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,936
<i>Couples like that always have one plan.</i>

92
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,441
<i>But that man…</i>
<i>He was dressed in expensive clothing.</i>

93
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,317
<i>He has a handsome face.</i>

94
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,945
<i>He doesn't seem to have a problem</i>
<i>with money or women.</i>

95
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,031
<i>Though I'm making assumptions.</i>
<i>Old man wouldn't like that.</i>

96
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,746
<i>He doesn't seem the type to take poison</i>
<i>for his future with a courtesan…</i>

97
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,253
I'm going to go check.

98
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,174
<i>The man's condition was more serious.</i>

99
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,807
What are you doing?!

100
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,274
Don't get in my way!
Bastards like him should die!

101
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:14,660
Ouch…

102
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,835
What are you two doing?

103
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,092
Ms. Apothecary,
can I talk to you for a minute?

104
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,434
He was a very problematic customer.

105
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,437
<i>He would say sweet words to courtesans,</i>

106
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,980
<i>act as if he were buying them out,</i>

107
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,941
<i>then abandon them once he got bored.</i>

108
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,193
<i>He incurred a lot of wrath.</i>

109
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,445
<i>He'd almost get stabbed</i>
<i>by an enraged woman,</i>

110
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,740
<i>or get poisoned.</i>

111
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:56,410
<i>But he's spoiled by his father,</i>
<i>who's a wealthy merchant.</i>

112
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,746
<i>Every time,</i>
<i>he would resolve problems with money.</i>

113
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,207
Recently,

114
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,211
he would come to brothels accompanied by
guards that he asked his parents for.

115
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,172
Her older sister was also
abandoned by that man.

116
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,927
She was looking forward to
living with him,

117
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:16,180
but he took it back
on the day of the buyout.

118
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,479
That's why she couldn't forgive him.

119
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,441
She was attached to the courtesan
that drank the poison today, so…

120
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,569
So I'm supposed to pretend
I didn't see this?

121
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,697
Customers like that shouldn't be
permitted to enter.

122
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,449
It was her that fell for him.

123
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,536
And it led to today's
suicide pact incident?

124
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:41,622
That's definitely a bad look
for the brothel.

125
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,000
<i>They must've been so generous with us</i>

126
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:48,212
<i>because we prevented the death of a</i>
<i>wealthy merchant's son at their business.</i>

127
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,422
<i>And that's why…</i>

128
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,678
<i>This situation must've felt</i>
<i>so unjust to this girl.</i>

129
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,599
I understand.

130
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,688
<i>I just happened to be back home today.</i>

131
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,815
<i>But if she runs errands every day,</i>

132
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:11,152
<i>she might have known the hours</i>
<i>that old man is out.</i>

133
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,323
<i>Normally, one would call a doctor.</i>

134
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,200
<i>If she purposefully came to call on</i>
<i>an absent apothecary…</i>

135
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,496
<i>That apprentice girl…</i>
<i>She's small, but frightening.</i>

136
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,378
What a situation for you,
after you came all this way.

137
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,047
Old man. Show me the cash.

138
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,634
<i>Yup. There's money inside.</i>

139
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,637
<i>Along with an added amount of hush money.</i>

140
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,889
<i>But something about this bothers me.</i>

141
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,893
<i>From what I hear, the man doesn't seem</i>
<i>the delicate type.</i>

142
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,898
<i>Would a man like that make a suicide pact</i>
<i>for a woman he loves?</i>

143
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,359
Was it a forced suicide pact?

144
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,780
But would a man who had been poisoned
before be so careless…?

145
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:00,242
Maomao.
I told you, don't make assumptions.

146
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,288
You already know the truth, don't you?

147
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,335
<i>Let me remember.</i>

148
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,253
<i>What was at the scene?</i>

149
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,215
<i>Did I miss anything?</i>

150
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,800
<i>Tobacco leaves are poisonous.</i>

151
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,885
<i>This is what they'd use</i>
<i>for a suicide pact.</i>

152
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,305
<i>But what if this was dissolved in water</i>
<i>in the first place?</i>

153
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,641
It was her that fell for him.

154
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,268
<i>Bastards like him should die!</i>

155
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:30,022
<i>She was attached to the courtesan</i>
<i>that drank the poison today, so…</i>

156
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:34,110
<i>I see. They use this to prevent</i>
<i>lipstick stains on the cups.</i>

157
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,992
This wasn't a suicide pact.

158
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,078
It was murder.

159
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,796
Substance dissolved in water… Wheat stalk…

160
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,841
Two different types of alcohol…

161
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,013
It's all over, all right?

162
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,891
I know that.

163
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,981
<i>A murder, not a suicide pact.</i>

164
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,900
<i>And the murderer was the courtesan.</i>

165
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:19,405
<i>The murder weapon was alcohol</i>
<i>poisoned with tobacco.</i>

166
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:23,826
<i>But how did she make the man drink</i>
<i>the poison, when he was so cautious</i>

167
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,036
<i>of his safety that he had personal guards?</i>

168
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:28,247
<i>It's quite simple.</i>

169
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,833
<i>She could drink it herself.</i>

170
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,670
<i>If the courtesan is safe,</i>
<i>the man would drink the alcohol, too.</i>

171
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:39,091
<i>But if she actually drank</i>
<i>the poisonous alcohol, she'd be in danger.</i>

172
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,469
<i>That's why she used those tools.</i>

173
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,597
<i>Two types of alcohol and one cup.</i>

174
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:49,810
<i>Different types of alcohol differ</i>
<i>in richness and density.</i>

175
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:54,398
<i>If you pour light alcohol slowly</i>
<i>on top of heavy alcohol,</i>

176
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,734
<i>it will create</i>
<i>aesthetically pleasing layers.</i>

177
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,737
<i>If she performed this trick</i>
<i>as a way to please customers,</i>

178
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:03,115
<i>the courtesan could drink only</i>
<i>the bottom layer</i>

179
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,826
<i>using the wheat stalk.</i>

180
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,968
<i>The courtesan also drank</i>
<i>the top layer alcohol.</i>

181
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,721
<i>Only a small amount,</i>
<i>so that she wouldn't die.</i>

182
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,475
<i>The plan would be pointless</i>
<i>if she died as well.</i>

183
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,356
<i>She calculated the timing</i>

184
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,442
<i>so that he would die,</i>
<i>and she would survive.</i>

185
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,694
<i>That's why it happened in the morning.</i>

186
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,573
<i>And conveniently,</i>
<i>someone found them like that.</i>

187
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,451
<i>She is delicate,</i>

188
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,912
<i>but tough at the same time.</i>

189
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,731
What are you doing, Big Sis?

190
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,483
You have to stay asleep!

191
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,152
<i>The apprentice's actions were a bit off.</i>

192
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,822
<i>She went to the apothecary</i>

193
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:27,741
<i>and not the doctor</i>
<i>so that the man would run out of time.</i>

194
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,785
<i>She took her time to bring old man.</i>

195
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,747
<i>Was she not concerned for her "Big Sis"?</i>

196
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,417
<i>Did she not think that just like her</i>

197
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,004
<i>actual older sister, someone close to her</i>
<i>could die again?</i>

198
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:44,592
<i>It's almost as if she knew</i>
<i>she wouldn't die.</i>

199
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,760
<i>Could be. Or I'm just overthinking things.</i>

200
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,764
<i>And the courtesan who was oddly</i>
<i>sympathetic to the apprentice.</i>

201
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,934
<i>The granny who paid us well.</i>

202
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,521
<i>Anyone can seem suspicious</i>
<i>if you view them that way.</i>

203
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,857
<i>Could it be that everyone was…</i>

204
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,615
<i>I can't be making assumptions.</i>

205
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,286
<i>I wanted to come back here</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

206
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,997
<i>But here's no different</i>
<i>than the rear palace.</i>

207
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,292
<i>It's a flower garden, a bird cage.</i>

208
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:23,088
<i>All become poisoned by</i>
<i>the air in this trapped environment.</i>

209
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,301
<i>And the courtesans, by eating</i>
<i>others' poisons,</i>

210
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,803
<i>themselves become sweet poison.</i>

211
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,347
THE VERDIGRIS HOUSE

212
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,560
<i>I don't know what will happen</i>
<i>to that courtesan.</i>

213
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,228
<i>The spoiled son could</i>

214
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,231
<i>claim and complain that he got poisoned,</i>

215
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:42,775
<i>or it could be that</i>

216
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,819
<i>the brothel threatens him</i>
<i>for ruining their merchandise.</i>

217
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,531
It doesn't matter either way.

218
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,493
If we troubled our minds
about these things,

219
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,119
we'd never survive this town.

220
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,206
Maomao!

221
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,334
Big Sis Meimei!

222
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,005
You're already going back to the palace?

223
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,466
I still have a year left
in my term of service.

224
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,135
And if I quit my job,
I'd cause trouble to others.

225
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,180
I see. But you only just got home.

226
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:18,435
Everyone was so worried
after you went missing suddenly.

227
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,521
Pairin, Juka, and Granny too.

228
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:22,606
But they didn't mention that at all…

229
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,402
Everyone acted like
nothing was wrong, right?

230
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,861
It's because you came back.

231
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,863
I see.

232
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,827
Did that make you sad?

233
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,078
It's okay, baby!

234
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,913
Stop that, Big Sis Meimei!

235
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,379
Maomao. Did you go to the annex?

236
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,841
Yeah. I'll go later.

237
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,812
Be careful, all right?

238
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,313
You too, old man.

239
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,232
I'll be off.

240
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,694
<i>My three-day homecoming</i>

241
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,946
<i>ended before I realized.</i>

242
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,202
You're already going home?
What a disappointment!

243
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,329
Right, Sir Lihaku?

244
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,374
Yes! What a disappointment, truly!

245
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,501
<i>Looks like he enjoyed his time here.</i>

246
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,171
<i>Once you taste the sweet nectar</i>
<i>of the heavens,</i>

247
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,672
<i>you can't come back to earth.</i>

248
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,968
<i>He'll continue to get squeezed out</i>
<i>so that he neither lives nor dies.</i>

249
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,053
<i>Even so,</i>

250
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,765
<i>I'm the one paying for what</i>
<i>the advance payment couldn't cover.</i>

251
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,643
Call me when you're back, all right?

252
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,522
<i>Now I know exactly</i>
<i>where I'm selling myself to next.</i>

253
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,531
<i>Why is he glaring at me like that?</i>

254
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,325
<i>I'll get out of here quickly.</i>

255
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,702
I'm going to go change now.

256
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,079
-Tell us…
-Everything…

257
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,413
Later!

258
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,295
I'll be waiting for you
in the reception room.

259
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,810
Excuse me.

260
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:29,691
<i>His attitude is worse than usual.</i>

261
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,528
<i>Am I just imagining things?</i>

262
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,447
<i>I hope that's the case.</i>
<i>We'll put it that way.</i>

263
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,910
<i>But… why is it just the two of us?</i>

264
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,788
I hear you visited home.

265
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,164
Yes.

266
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:45,999
How was it?

267
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,752
Everyone seemed to be doing well.
I was glad.

268
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,506
-I see.
-Yes, sir.

269
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,969
And what kind of man is this Lihaku?

270
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,011
Huh?

271
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,721
He's my surety.

272
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,100
<i>Why does he know his name?</i>

273
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,938
Do you know what that means?

274
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,441
Yes. He has to be of a certain status.

275
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,193
Otherwise, he can't be my surety.

276
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,573
What?

277
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,492
Did he give you a hair clip?

278
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,661
He was handing several of them out.

279
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,246
It was an obligatory gift to me.

280
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,709
You mean to tell me
I lost to an obligatory gift?

281
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,754
I gave you one also.

282
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,798
But you never talked to me.

283
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,302
<i>"I"? What?</i>

284
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,806
<i>So he's in a bad mood</i>
<i>because I didn't propose an offer to him?</i>

285
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,309
<i>That's very strange.</i>

286
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:49,062
<i>It's better not to get involved in</i>
<i>troublesome things.</i>

287
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,023
<i>He's always bored.</i>

288
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:53,400
<i>Does he want attention,</i>
<i>even when it's troublesome?</i>

289
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,403
I'm so sorry, sir.

290
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,031
I could not think of a worthy payment

291
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,324
that would satisfy you.

292
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,369
What payment?

293
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,373
Did you make this "payment"
to this Lihaku man?

294
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,502
Of course. He seemed happy with
his one night of dreams.

295
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,214
One night?

296
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,926
He seemed extremely satisfied.

297
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,470
I'm glad I worked hard too.

298
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,392
What are you doing?

299
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,770
Use this, before it stains.

300
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,521
Excuse me, sir.

301
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,608
You should wash this right away.

302
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:41,240
I'll carry this teacup away,
so don't touch it.

303
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,245
Excuse me.
