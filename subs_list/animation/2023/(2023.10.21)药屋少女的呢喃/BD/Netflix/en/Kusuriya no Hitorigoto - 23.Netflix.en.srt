ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,009
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:34,469
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,100
<i>Kitty cat, kitty cat</i>

5
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,898
<i>Kitty cat, kitty cat</i>

6
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,983
<i>She cries and cries</i>

7
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:52,153
<i>Wondering</i>

8
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:56,366
<i>Where that child is</i>

9
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,829
{\an8}MINISTER - SCHOLAR

10
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,878
Will you play with me, sir?

11
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,467
How could I say no?

12
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:17,720
It's my beloved daughter's request.

13
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,474
We'll play by the standard rules
for five matches.

14
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,145
Whoever wins three matches first wins.

15
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,313
What should my disadvantage be?

16
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,149
Which piece should I get rid of?

17
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,900
There's no need for that.

18
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,528
<i>She should just accept.</i>

19
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,990
Let's decide what to bet on.

20
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,908
Wow, getting straight to the point!

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,538
If I win, you'll become my child, right?

22
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:49,836
-You promised not to say anything.
-Yes, but…

23
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:56,384
That is fine. But I'm
under an employment contract.

24
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,136
So it'll be after my time is up.

25
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,307
An employment contract?
He really hired you?

26
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,683
Yes.

27
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:09,856
But in return, if I win…

28
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:14,360
Will you buy out a courtesan
from the Verdigris House?

29
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,573
I didn't expect you to say that.

30
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,700
I won't say who,

31
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:24,245
but Grams is looking for a way
to get rid of a certain courtesan.

32
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,290
I see, that's how you'll play.

33
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:32,420
If that's what you want,
I'll have to say yes.

34
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,547
That's all you want?

35
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,883
I'll add two more rules, then.

36
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,017
<i>It smells like a strong distilled liquor.</i>

37
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,275
<i>I have a really bad feeling about this.</i>

38
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,236
And what is that?

39
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,821
A little bit of this is medicine.

40
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,783
Three mouthfuls, and it's a strong poison.

41
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,120
I'll pour this liquid into three cups,

42
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,582
and mix it up so you don't know which cup.

43
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,836
After each match,
the winner chooses a cup,

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,631
and the loser drinks it.

45
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,466
That's the first rule.

46
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,177
<i>Her ideas are so frightening.</i>

47
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:25,431
And the second rule is,
no matter what the reason is,

48
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,352
if you forfeit the match, you lose.

49
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,813
Is that all right?

50
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,819
Yes, that's fine.

51
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,071
<i>Is she trying to throw him off balance?</i>

52
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,075
<i>True, a normal person might</i>
<i>flinch at that. However,</i>

53
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,288
<i>her opponent is a Sir General known</i>
<i>for being eccentric.</i>

54
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,582
<i>I can't imagine him getting agitated</i>
<i>by such a threat.</i>

55
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,879
<i>What is she thinking?</i>

56
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,635
<i>She lost again.</i>

57
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,138
<i>That's her second loss in a row!</i>

58
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,309
<i>She challenged a general known for</i>
<i>being a chess master</i>

59
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,895
<i>so I thought she had some skill, but…</i>

60
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,773
<i>It seems she only knows the rules</i>

61
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,649
<i>and has no experience in playing matches.</i>

62
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,486
<i>She already drank two cups.</i>

63
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:06,115
<i>She seemed to enjoy drinking them,</i>
<i>so I can't tell if it's poisoned or not.</i>

64
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,410
May I start the third match?

65
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,496
Sure, of course.

66
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,500
<i>What is she thinking?</i>

67
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,169
<i>We all know how the third match will end.</i>

68
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,507
<i>If the two cups she already drank</i>
<i>had poison inside,</i>

69
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,675
<i>it's too dangerous to drink the third cup.</i>

70
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,472
<i>How much of this current situation</i>
<i>has Lakan analyzed?</i>

71
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:33,309
Checkmate.

72
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:36,646
You got me.

73
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:40,566
I know you let me win,
but it's still a win.

74
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:46,781
I can't make my daughter take poison,
even by accident.

75
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,575
Which will you choose for me?

76
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,285
Choose whatever you'd like.

77
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:55,123
Does the medicine have any taste?

78
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:58,292
You'd notice the bad taste right away
after one swallow.

79
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,380
<i>Lakan is allowed to lose twice.</i>

80
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,924
<i>If one cup of the two tastes different,</i>

81
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:07,552
<i>he'll know that his daughter won't</i>
<i>take any poison.</i>

82
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,638
<i>He lost deliberately for that purpose.</i>

83
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,057
<i>He really is a shrewd man.</i>

84
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,309
I'll choose this, then.

85
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,076
It tastes bad.

86
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,455
<i>He drank the poison!</i>

87
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,708
<i>Now, the Apothecary won't drink the poison</i>
<i>for her third cup.</i>

88
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,085
<i>This also means</i>

89
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,464
<i>that Lakan won't have to keep losing</i>
<i>on purpose anymore.</i>

90
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,467
<i>Now, the Apothecary can never win.</i>

91
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:51,304
If I win, you'll become my child, right?

92
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,308
Also, I feel hot.

93
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,824
What's going on?

94
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,785
I thought the poison wouldn't harm anyone
with one cup!

95
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,537
I know you hate him.

96
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,373
-But I didn't think you'd poison him!
-It's medicine.

97
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,084
They say sake is the best medicine,
after all.

98
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,921
Sake? What do you mean?

99
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:25,880
Sir Jinshi.

100
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:30,051
-It looks like he's just drunk.
-What?

101
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,392
He's an extreme lightweight.

102
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,478
Now that I think about it,

103
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,733
<i>he's always drinking juice.</i>
<i>I've never seen him drink sake.</i>

104
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,778
So what was the liquid you poured in?

105
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,864
It was alcohol. All right, then.

106
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,494
Let's carry this man out,

107
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,080
and have him pick out a flower
from the brothel.

108
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,507
<i>Ever since I was born, I couldn't</i>
<i>distinguish people as individuals.</i>

109
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,969
<i>It wasn't just confusing my wet nurse</i>
<i>as my mother.</i>

110
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,888
<i>I couldn't even distinguish between a man</i>
<i>and a woman.</i>

111
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:20,685
<i>My father got fed up with me,</i>
<i>saying that I would be useless,</i>

112
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,312
<i>and started visiting</i>
<i>his extramarital lover regularly.</i>

113
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:28,234
<i>My mother was desperate to</i>
<i>get my father back.</i>

114
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:32,989
<i>That was how I was able to</i>
<i>immerse myself in go and chess,</i>

115
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,450
<i>and live freely,</i>
<i>despite being the first son</i>

116
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,287
<i>of a noble family.</i>

117
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,414
<i>Don't remember people by their face.</i>

118
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,207
<i>Remember them by their voice,</i>

119
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,668
<i>gestures, and body type.</i>

120
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,421
<i>I'm sure you would enjoy chess.</i>

121
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,925
<i>Only my uncle understood me.</i>

122
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,388
<i>Thanks to my tactless yet talented uncle,</i>

123
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,933
<i>I was able to see people's faces</i>
<i>as chess pieces.</i>

124
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,688
<i>When I saw my uncle's face as a Chariot,</i>

125
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:09,775
<i>I truly understood that he was</i>
<i>a talented and intelligent man.</i>

126
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,447
<i>After I grew up, even though I was</i>
<i>untalented in the art of war,</i>

127
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,075
<i>I was appointed to be a leader right away</i>
<i>because of my background.</i>

128
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,702
<i>Even if I was weak,</i>

129
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,955
<i>I could be successful</i>
<i>if I could use my men efficiently.</i>

130
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,626
<i>Playing chess with real people</i>
<i>as its pieces</i>

131
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,295
<i>was merely a captivating game to me.</i>

132
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,421
THE VERDIGRIS HOUSE

133
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,549
<i>While I continued to be unbeatable</i>
<i>in work and in chess,</i>

134
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:39,138
<i>I ended up playing against a famous</i>
<i>courtesan when I visited a brothel.</i>

135
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,308
<i>Amongst the sea of whites and blacks,</i>

136
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,812
<i>those fingertips had a vibrant glow.</i>

137
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,066
<i>Her name was Fengxian.</i>

138
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:55,112
<i>An unbeatable courtesan at a brothel,</i>
<i>versus an unbeatable military man.</i>

139
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,075
<i>No matter who lost,</i>
<i>the audience would be captivated.</i>

140
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,911
<i>She is good for sure.</i>

141
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,455
<i>Even so, she is merely a frog in a well.</i>

142
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,876
<i>I lost?</i>

143
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,504
<i>She dominated me completely.</i>

144
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,298
<i>When was the last time I lost like this?</i>

145
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,979
<i>So this is what a human face looks like.</i>

146
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,735
{\an8}<i>Her eyes are like a balsam fruit,</i>
<i>which could pop</i>

147
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,532
{\an8}<i>with a single touch,</i>
<i>keeping people at a distance…</i>

148
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,583
<i>I won't lose next time.</i>

149
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:55,214
<i>For several years after that,</i>
<i>I only met her to play</i>

150
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,341
<i>go and chess.</i>

151
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,723
<i>Fengxian, who was born at the brothel,</i>

152
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,601
<i>had a personality only shaped by pride.</i>

153
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,312
I do not have a mother.

154
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,606
There was a woman who gave birth to me,

155
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:16,527
but in the pleasure district,
courtesans cannot be mothers.

156
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,740
<i>Talented courtesans,</i>

157
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,703
<i>once they become popular enough,</i>
<i>become harder to purchase.</i>

158
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,956
<i>This was also true of Fengxian.</i>

159
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:34,462
<i>Though her stern attitude was not</i>
<i>popular amongst most customers,</i>

160
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,465
<i>there were some with strange tastes</i>
<i>who enjoyed that.</i>

161
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,718
<i>Her price kept increasing more and more,</i>

162
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,847
<i>and I could only afford</i>
<i>to see her once every three months.</i>

163
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:55,316
A balsam flower and… What is that?

164
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,775
<i>Wood sorrel.</i>

165
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,944
<i>Also known as Cat's Feet.</i>

166
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,448
<i>It's a fresh medicine that works against</i>
<i>poison and insect bites.</i>

167
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,743
<i>Just like the balsam flower,</i>

168
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:10,372
<i>if you touch its ripened fruit,</i>
<i>the seeds burst and fly away.</i>

169
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,917
I see, how interesting.

170
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:17,087
When can you come next?

171
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,552
In three months' time.

172
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,388
I see.

173
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,394
<i>It was around that time that I heard</i>
<i>of Fengxian being bought out.</i>

174
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:38,484
<i>Her price kept increasing more and more</i>
<i>in the bidding war amongst her fans.</i>

175
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,238
<i>Though I had climbed the ranks</i>
<i>as a military man,</i>

176
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,075
<i>my step brothers had taken the right</i>
<i>to inherit the family title.</i>

177
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,787
<i>I could never compete with those prices.</i>

178
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,290
What if we bet on something today?

179
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:58,379
If you win, I'll give you
anything you'd like.

180
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,424
If I win, I'll take anything I want.

181
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,178
Which board would you like to play with?

182
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,266
<i>That's when a terrible idea</i>
<i>crossed my mind.</i>

183
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,271
-You'd like to play go, then?
-Yes.

184
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,776
-Meimei. I want to focus on the match.
-Yes, ma'am.

185
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,776
<i>Before we realized it,</i>
<i>our hands were placed together.</i>

186
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,407
<i>Fengxian spoke no sweet words.</i>

187
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,660
<i>I spoke none, either.</i>

188
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:15,080
<i>In many ways, we were very similar.</i>

189
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,833
I want to play go.

190
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:23,088
<i>I had thought I wanted to play chess too.</i>

191
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,592
<i>Kitty cat</i>

192
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:30,638
<i>Kitty cat</i>

193
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:35,100
<i>She cries and cries wondering</i>

194
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,771
<i>Where that child is</i>

195
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,359
<i>The little birds</i>

196
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,403
<i>That know nothing</i>

197
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:51,075
<i>Flew higher and higher</i>

198
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,411
<i>Up in the sky…</i>

199
00:15:55,412 --> 00:16:00,167
<i>Three months after that,</i>
<i>my talented uncle lost his position.</i>

200
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:04,004
You became a doctor in the rear palace,
and now you're expelled?

201
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,547
You disgrace the family name!

202
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,135
<i>He was talented, but remained tactless.</i>

203
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,597
You were close with him.

204
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,392
Leave this house and study abroad
for a while!

205
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,103
-Study abroad?
-It's a needed precaution.

206
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,314
-But…
-What is it?

207
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,067
No, it's nothing.

208
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:30,572
<i>I could not betray my father,</i>
<i>who was both my parent and a boss.</i>

209
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:36,829
<i>It was then that Fengxian wrote to me</i>
<i>saying she would not be bought out.</i>

210
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,708
<i>I had falsely assumed that I could return</i>

211
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,710
<i>in six months' time.</i>

212
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,379
<i>Back then…</i>

213
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:53,804
<i>I had not imagined that</i>

214
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,974
<i>it would take me three years</i>
<i>to return home.</i>

215
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,272
All these are letters from Fengxian?

216
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,623
Dirt? No, are these branches?

217
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,834
And there's two of them?

218
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,131
No! This is…

219
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,593
<i>Finger slicing…</i>

220
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,888
<i>I had heard that</i>
<i>the practice was popular as a curse.</i>

221
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:39,099
<i>The reason she ended up</i>
<i>not being bought out…</i>

222
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,395
<i>The other small finger</i>
<i>that was inside that bag…</i>

223
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,564
<i>How could I not realize?</i>

224
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,817
<i>I only had go and chess in mind.</i>

225
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:55,908
<i>I couldn't even arrive</i>
<i>at such a simple answer!</i>

226
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:56,909
THE VERDIGRIS HOUSE

227
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,787
Where is Fengxian?!

228
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,582
You! Fengxian is not here anymore!

229
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,542
Why are you here after all these years!

230
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,795
You left her for three years!

231
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,172
I bet you don't even care about
what happens

232
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,341
when a courtesan loses her value!

233
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,055
<i>If I had thought for a little bit,</i>
<i>I would've realized it.</i>

234
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,350
<i>Why her buying out offer was rescinded.</i>

235
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,727
<i>Inside Fengxian's belly was…</i>

236
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,230
<i>What happens to a courtesan</i>

237
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:30,734
<i>when she dishonors her brothel and her</i>
<i>trust and value plummets to the ground?</i>

238
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,530
<i>Like a nighthawk,</i>
<i>she receives any customer,</i>

239
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,032
<i>and eventually…</i>

240
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,586
<i>No matter how much I lament,</i>
<i>time won't turn back.</i>

241
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,548
<i>Everything happened because</i>

242
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,801
<i>I was so short-sighted. It's all my fault.</i>

243
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:12,109
This is… The Verdigris House.

244
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,529
Are you awake?

245
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,448
Meimei.

246
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,328
Some person of nobility brought you here.

247
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,455
You look very unwell.

248
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,083
Your face is both red and blue.

249
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,336
I didn't plan on being like this.

250
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,048
I didn't think that
the drink was so strong.

251
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:41,221
<i>Meimei used to be an apprentice</i>
<i>to Fengxian.</i>

252
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,558
<i>I used to play with Meimei quite a lot.</i>

253
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,146
<i>When told she had potential,</i>
<i>she seemed embarrassed but happy.</i>

254
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,398
Speaking of…

255
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,525
What's wrong?

256
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,111
No, it's nothing.

257
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:01,825
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

258
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,540
So bitter! What is this!

259
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,500
Maomao made that.

260
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,753
Mix, mix, mix.

261
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,006
I see, Maomao made this.

262
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,259
Also, Maomao made this box.

263
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,021
A dried rose?

264
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,901
Even after it has died,
you can preserve its form.

265
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,909
Big Sis Meimei.

266
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,286
Excuse me, sir.

267
