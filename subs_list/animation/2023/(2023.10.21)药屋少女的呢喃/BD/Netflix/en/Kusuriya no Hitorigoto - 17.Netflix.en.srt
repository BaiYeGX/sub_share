ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,967
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:33,927
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,597
{\an8}In that case, will you put makeup on me?

5
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,057
What?

6
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,065
<i>He doesn't need it.</i>

7
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,113
<i>Throughout history, there have been</i>
<i>many pointless battles.</i>

8
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:57,784
<i>Some of them</i>
<i>were caused by ruinous beauties.</i>

9
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:02,330
<i>If someone as beautiful as</i>
<i>a heavenly maiden put on makeup…</i>

10
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,251
-Are you trying to end a nation?
-Why?

11
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,629
What are you thinking about?

12
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:13,466
How do you create your face powder?

13
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>Oh, the makeup to make yourself</i>
<i>look dull, not beautiful.</i>

14
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,141
I dry some clay and turn it into powder,

15
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,768
and mix it with oil.

16
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,187
Can you prepare that in a short time?

17
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,273
Yes. I only need one night.

18
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,360
It's a bit too dark for you, Sir Jinshi.

19
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,613
If only there were some medicine
to change my face.

20
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:39,159
You could paint some lacquer on your face,

21
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,994
but it would stay that way forever.

22
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,246
Figures.

23
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,833
If your goal is to look like a commoner,

24
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,210
I could do that for you.

25
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,588
Please do that then.

26
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:55,133
Make me look like
a completely different person.

27
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,805
What is he planning?

28
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:03,975
<i>In that case…</i>

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,937
<i>I'll go all in!</i>

30
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,942
{\an8}So cold!

31
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,653
Good morning…

32
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,371
What's wrong? Already in a bad mood?
It's still morning.

33
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,918
No, you'll be beautiful all day as usual.

34
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,127
Are you making fun of me?

35
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:36,132
Sir Jinshi, so you really want to
become another person?

36
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,135
I've been saying that since last night.

37
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,803
Then, excuse me.

38
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:50,355
Oh, wow!

39
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,190
What is it?

40
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:56,110
No commoner would burn
such expensive incense.

41
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,782
Your clothes right now are daily wear
for a low-class government official.

42
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:05,703
It has no business being near
high-quality fragrant wood from overseas.

43
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,164
You can tell?

44
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,291
I just developed a sense of smell

45
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,543
to differentiate
medicinal herbs and poison.

46
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,005
Do you know how we recognize
rich clients in brothels?

47
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,633
No. Is it by figure or clothes?

48
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,262
That too,
but we use one more thing: Smell.

49
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,224
A customer smelling of
many different scents in bad taste

50
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,644
is rich, but is at a high risk
of having STIs.

51
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,648
If they smell like livestock,
they don't bathe and are unsanitary.

52
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:37,986
Most new customers that come to visit
Verdigris House are turned away.

53
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:44,867
With these things, you should ask
those who know about the world.

54
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:50,540
Sir Gaoshun, could you prepare
new clothes for him?

55
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,627
Preferably, something that hasn't been
washed, and smells a bit.

56
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,212
Oh, my.

57
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,588
-Understood.
-Hey!

58
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,216
While we're waiting for that…

59
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,639
-What is that?
-Oil and salt.

60
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,769
We'll take away the luster in his hair,
and worsen his hair texture.

61
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,564
Excuse me, sir.

62
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,870
<i>This is probably enough.</i>

63
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:34,876
Hey, you don't have to tie it
with scrap fabric.

64
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,920
Commoners tie their hair
with whatever's lying around.

65
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,673
Are you sure this is good?

66
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,347
He could smell a little worse.

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,185
Sir Jinshi, please take off your clothes.

68
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,686
Oh, sure…

69
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,318
<i>He looks like a heavenly maiden,</i>

70
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,945
<i>but he has well-proportioned muscles.</i>

71
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,283
May I use that towel?

72
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,703
You can, but what will you use it for?

73
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,663
I'm changing his body.

74
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:16,209
Can you both please help me?

75
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,754
Sir Gaoshun, hold this.

76
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,257
-Okay.
-Ms. Suiren, please hold here.

77
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,427
-Got it!
-Put clothes on the top, and now…

78
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,305
Oh, my.

79
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:37,021
<i>It's odd to see Sir Jinshi's face</i>
<i>on such a clumsy figure.</i>

80
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,107
Now, let's do the face.

81
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,611
I created some face powders with
dark colors.

82
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,573
I'll use this to create sunburnt skin,
just like a commoner.

83
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,826
Close your eyes, please.

84
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,035
All right.

85
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,500
<i>His face is beautiful even from close up.</i>

86
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,336
<i>He has no facial hair or visible pores.</i>

87
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,172
<i>What would female makeup look like on him?</i>

88
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:12,014
<i>Here it is! Makeup that Big Sis Meimei</i>
<i>forced on me.</i>

89
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,183
Hey, are we done yet?

90
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,854
Can you close your mouth too?
Not too tight.

91
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,615
What's wrong?

92
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,535
<i>I'm glad it was just us three.</i>

93
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:36,080
<i>If anyone else were here,</i>
<i>it would've caused an uproar.</i>

94
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,458
Hey, what's going on?

95
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,461
It's nothing, sir.

96
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,504
That hurts. What happened?

97
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,840
-Nothing.
-It was nothing.

98
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,717
Yes, nothing at all.

99
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,219
Let's get back on track.

100
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,972
I'll apply face powder in a patchy way,

101
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:56,350
and create eye bags with a dark color.

102
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,062
Add some moles,

103
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,065
and draw eyebrows asymmetrically.

104
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,901
I'll use leftover face powder

105
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,570
to create pigmentation spots
around the body.

106
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,574
Add some powder under the nails
to create unsanitary hands.

107
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:16,579
<i>Those are strong, male hands.</i>
<i>Not elegant hands like I imagined.</i>

108
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,040
<i>He has blisters.</i>

109
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,585
<i>I thought he only held</i>
<i>brushes and chopsticks.</i>

110
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,630
<i>Does he fight with swords or sticks?</i>

111
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:29,592
<i>Those skills are not needed for eunuchs.</i>

112
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,096
<i>I don't need to ask pointless questions.</i>

113
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,516
Wow, they look dirty.

114
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,520
-Here you are.
-Is that a drink?

115
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:45,900
Oh! What is this?

116
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,944
Please lick it slowly

117
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,363
as if wetting your lips, and swallow.

118
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,199
Your lips and throat will swell,
and your voice will change.

119
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,825
What's in it?

120
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,911
<i>Different types of stimulants.</i>

121
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:01,082
<i>They're very spicy,</i>
<i>but not poisonous, so don't worry.</i>

122
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,589
Please drink it all.

123
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,803
Some finishing touches.

124
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,180
It's cotton.

125
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,975
Please stuff these
in your cheeks to change your face shape.

126
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:25,356
We're all finished.

127
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,905
Is it really you, Young Master?

128
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,283
Don't call me Young Master.

129
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,078
<i>He still looks pretty handsome.</i>

130
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,289
<i>Can't do anything with his natural beauty.</i>

131
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,042
<i>I've done all I can.</i>

132
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,631
Now, I can visit home for the first time
in a while!

133
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:55,052
Xiaomao, you said you were visiting
home today, right?

134
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,680
Yes. I got some time off until tomorrow…

135
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,268
<i>I haven't seen him make this face before…</i>

136
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:07,356
In that case, Sir Jinshi will be taking
the same route part of the way.

137
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:13,779
If he's disguised, it would be strange
if he is accompanied by

138
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,615
his usual servants.

139
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,992
Oh, that's true.

140
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,953
Don't you think so too, Sir Jinshi?

141
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,705
That's true.

142
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,375
It would help me a lot
if you were with me.

143
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,419
<i>Oh, no! Sir Jinshi likes the idea too!</i>

144
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,673
I'm sorry, Sir Jinshi, but if I were to
accompany you, it would look

145
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,133
very plain.

146
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:39,930
Of course, a homely servant may be
better for a homely master,

147
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,392
but people do know me
as your live-in maid, so…

148
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,144
That's not true.

149
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,606
In that case,
you should disguise yourself too.

150
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,900
-What?
-That's a great idea.

151
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,944
Makeup brushes, hair chopsticks…

152
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,655
I have it all!

153
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,198
But…

154
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:00,951
You just have to look very
unlike your usual self, right?

155
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,537
Right?

156
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,123
Yes…

157
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,959
<i>I only have bad feelings about this.</i>

158
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:18,177
Sir Jinshi, your posture is too perfect.

159
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,680
You watch what you're saying too.

160
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,683
If you say my name,
my disguise is pointless.

161
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,353
In that case, what should I call you?

162
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:28,979
Let's see…

163
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,693
Starting now, please call me Jinka, Miss.

164
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,945
What?

165
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,281
I think that's appropriate,
based on how we're dressed.

166
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,201
<i>He's right.</i>

167
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,162
<i>It belongs to Ms. Suiren's daughter.</i>

168
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:48,874
<i>The fabric and design are high quality,</i>
<i>and it's not too old-fashioned.</i>

169
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,711
<i>Based on my clothes, I could look like</i>
<i>a rich girl with a servant.</i>

170
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,051
<i>Why is he enjoying himself that much?</i>

171
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:05,975
Here is the map. For Xiaomao…

172
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,687
You can entrust me with Miss, sir!

173
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,273
Thank you.

174
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,862
Sir Jinka, then.

175
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,245
-Jinka.
-Yes, Miss!

176
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,040
-Your posture is too straight.
-Yes, Miss!

177
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,964
<i>Jinka, huh?</i>

178
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,425
<i>It's not so strange for a fake name,</i>

179
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,387
<i>but adding the character for "Hana"</i>
<i>is an odd choice.</i>

180
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,639
<i>Same with the name Jinshi,</i>

181
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,641
<i>but it's not a common male name.</i>

182
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,353
<i>Maybe we should've dressed him as a woman…</i>

183
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:57,401
<i>No, for the peace of this world,</i>
<i>we should avoid that.</i>

184
00:12:58,569 --> 00:12:59,653
Where are we heading?

185
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,949
A diner right by the entrance
of the pleasure district.

186
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,868
I'm meeting an acquaintance there.

187
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,626
Why do I have to be a bodyguard?

188
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,214
And why do I have to keep a distance?

189
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,769
<i>A servant stepping in front of their</i>
<i>master? He still has lots to learn.</i>

190
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,355
Jinka.

191
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,900
I'm so sorry, Miss.

192
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,318
Very good.

193
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,574
<i>It's too early for leafy vegetables,</i>
<i>I see.</i>

194
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,621
I got my allowance, so maybe

195
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,207
I'll have them butcher some chicken
for some stew.

196
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,458
You're shopping?

197
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,169
With those clothes?

198
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,930
<i>I wanted to get some for Old Man.</i>

199
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,058
<i>He's by far the most talented</i>

200
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,186
<i>doctor and apothecary in the area,</i>
<i>but for some reason,</i>

201
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:19,692
<i>he has no idea how to calculate</i>
<i>his profits and losses.</i>

202
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,985
<i>Because of that,</i>

203
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,612
<i>even though his profession</i>
<i>is very profitable,</i>

204
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,197
<i>he lives in a ramshackle hut.</i>

205
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,618
<i>If he ever starves,</i>

206
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,747
<i>I'm sure Grams would at least</i>
<i>pour food in his mouth, but…</i>

207
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,926
-What is it?
-Why aren't you talking?

208
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,388
Because there's nothing to say?

209
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,311
<i>Did I say something to offend him?</i>

210
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,439
Oh, this smell is…

211
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,190
Grilled chicken skewers!

212
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,401
Please wait a minute.

213
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,280
-Mister, two skewers, please!
-Coming up!

214
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,744
Here you are.
Let's eat before it gets cold.

215
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,582
Yeah.

216
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,757
<i>The savory chicken skin,</i>
<i>the grease that spreads in your mouth!</i>

217
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,217
<i>I can't eat this in the court.</i>

218
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:31,847
You're not eating this?
It's not poisoned, as you can see.

219
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,975
-Well…
-Oh.

220
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,227
Here you are.

221
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,279
How is it?

222
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,117
It's better than what I ate
on the campsite. It's nice and salty.

223
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,744
<i>Campsite?</i>

224
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:57,623
<i>I thought eunuchs didn't do jobs</i>
<i>that soldiers do.</i>

225
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,627
<i>Looks like he's enjoying it.</i>

226
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,425
Welcome back, Gaoshun.

227
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,178
Don't touch the wicker.

228
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,931
I just applied some persimmon juice.

229
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,392
It's Young Master's toys.

230
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,103
-Nostalgic, right?
-Yes.

231
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,356
So, how was it?

232
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,233
He was in a great mood.

233
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,363
It was a great idea.
Didn't expect that from you.

234
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,242
Once he found a toy he liked,

235
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,412
Young Master would only play with that.

236
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:42,584
If we hid the toy, he'd cry so much
no one could handle him.

237
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:48,757
You tried to deal with him often
by bringing new toys.

238
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,887
Growing an attachment to one thing.

239
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,683
Sir Jinshi is not in the position
to be able to do that.

240
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:02,479
You don't need to hurry so much.

241
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,024
You're meeting someone, right?

242
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,651
You should get there as fast as you can.

243
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,239
It sounds like you're impatient
to get rid of me.

244
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,407
Does it?

245
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,246
<i>It's true that I'm planning on going back</i>
<i>to buy radishes and chicken after this.</i>

246
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,539
You know,

247
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,419
life at the court isn't bad, is it?

248
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:30,758
I'm sure it's better than life
in the pleasure district.

249
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,303
You're right. It's not bad.

250
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:37,931
I serve the court of my own will.

251
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,517
And the room I have is clean
and beautiful.

252
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,604
<i>I'm just worried for my adoptive father.</i>

253
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:46,607
<i>I'm worried about how he's living.</i>

254
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,485
What's wrong?

255
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:54,114
I'm surprised you care about something
other than medicine or poison.

256
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,076
My father is my mentor in medicine.

257
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,787
I need him to live a long life.

258
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,540
Your father must be a talented apothecary.

259
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,212
He's skilled not only in Chinese medicine,

260
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:09,755
but Western medical practices as well.

261
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,049
He used to study abroad in the West.

262
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,928
He must've been extremely skilled.

263
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,265
You can only study abroad if you've been
selected by the country.

264
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,643
Yes, he's an accomplished person.

265
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,020
They say God doesn't grant humans
two talents,

266
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,272
but that's what he has.

267
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,691
He must be a great man.

268
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,529
Why is such a person working
as an apothecary in the pleasure district?

269
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:37,533
He was granted many things, but not luck.

270
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,535
He has two talents,

271
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,787
but his one important body part
was taken away.

272
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:47,167
You're saying your adoptive father
is a eunuch?

273
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,128
Yes, that's right.

274
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,759
<i>Did my pleasure district-style joke</i>
<i>not land?</i>

275
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,346
<i>Because Old Man studied abroad</i>
<i>in the West,</i>

276
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,891
<i>he was turned into</i>
<i>a eunuch by the previous Emperor's mother,</i>

277
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,185
<i>or the former Empress.</i>

278
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:09,148
A eunuch, apothecary, court physician…

279
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,732
<i>Have I not told him?</i>

280
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:14,778
<i>Oh, is that it?</i>

281
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,114
<i>A hotel on the second floor,</i>
<i>a diner on the first.</i>

282
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,366
Stop by!

283
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,659
Hey, now.

284
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,953
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

285
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,914
<i>That's why he came here disguised.</i>

286
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,252
You should have come to
the pleasure district, then.

287
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,672
-Huh? What do you mean?
-It's nothing.

288
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:40,179
Apothecary, are you familiar
with the Verdigris House's regulars?

289
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,932
Yes, if they're the flashy type.

290
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,642
What kind of men?

291
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,395
It's a secret. A brothel is confidential.

292
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,899
In that case,

293
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:57,029
how do you lower the value of a courtesan?

294
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,824
That's a very unpleasant question.

295
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,333
There are many ways,
especially for high-class courtesans.

296
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,543
<i>At the Verdigris House,</i>

297
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,630
<i>most courtesans are trained</i>
<i>when they are apprentices.</i>

298
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,842
<i>Out of those, they're divided between</i>
<i>the beautiful and plain girls,</i>

299
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:24,348
<i>and the latter will take clients</i>
<i>and sell themselves after their debut.</i>

300
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,268
<i>Girls with potential will serve tea</i>
<i>and find clients</i>

301
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,270
<i>through manners and education.</i>

302
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,855
<i>Their value will keep going up,</i>

303
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,900
<i>and if she stops coming out as much</i>
<i>at that point,</i>

304
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,862
<i>then you have a popular courtesan who will</i>
<i>cost a year's worth of silver to have tea.</i>

305
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:44,201
<i>Some of these girls remain untouched</i>
<i>by clients until they're bought out.</i>

306
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,956
They're valuable because
they're untainted flowers.

307
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,126
If she is touched, her value
would go down by half. Finally,

308
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:59,675
if she becomes pregnant,
she is practically worthless.

309
