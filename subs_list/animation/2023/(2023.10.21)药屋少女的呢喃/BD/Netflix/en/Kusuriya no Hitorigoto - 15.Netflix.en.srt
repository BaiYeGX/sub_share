ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,257
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,175
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,677
{\an8}Did you hear about the fire the other day?

5
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,472
Quite an accomplishment for Lihaku,
I'd say.

6
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:40,058
I never thought he'd solve it.

7
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,977
Seems like, according to rumors,

8
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,522
a maidservant played
a big part in solving it.

9
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,065
A maidservant?

10
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,651
Apparently it's Sir Jinshi's
assigned servant.

11
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,528
Is that so?

12
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:56,366
Speaking of Sir Jinshi, he bought out
a courtesan from the Verdigris House.

13
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,787
I heard she's an intellectual beauty
with a cold look!

14
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,289
That's what the guys who saw her said!

15
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,334
-Oh…
-Sir Lakan?

16
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:13,967
Could you tell me a little more?

17
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,853
Xiaomao, can I talk to you for a bit?

18
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,188
What is it, Sir Gaoshun?

19
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,401
I want you to take a look at this.

20
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,821
Documents on an old case?

21
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,240
A merchant family ten years ago

22
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,827
got food poisoning from a dish
of puffer fish and vegetables.

23
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,288
<i>Poison from puffer fish…</i>

24
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,999
<i>That tingly poison feels so good!</i>

25
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,792
<i>I want some right now…</i>

26
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,171
I'll take you to a restaurant
that serves a similar dish.

27
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,467
So, what's happening?

28
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,929
I was involved with this case for work

29
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,223
back when it happened.

30
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,270
<i>A very similar case to this</i>
<i>happened recently,</i>

31
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,231
<i>and a former coworker asked for my help.</i>

32
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,941
A similar case?

33
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,153
A government official ate a dish
of puffer fish and vegetables,

34
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,280
and is in a comatose state now.

35
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,657
A comatose state…?

36
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:23,202
Excuse me, but…

37
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,289
Is it okay that I'm hearing about this?

38
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,207
It's not a problem.

39
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:31,461
You're someone who knows your position.

40
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,172
<i>So it's confidential, huh?</i>

41
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,716
And you've already heard this much.

42
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,261
Do you really want to cut off
a story about poison right here?

43
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,641
Please. Go right ahead.

44
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,103
PUFFER FISH

45
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,813
This time, the dish contained

46
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,651
<i>parboiled puffer fish skin and flesh.</i>

47
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,112
He ate that, and then went into a coma.

48
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,073
He ate puffer fish flesh?

49
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,409
Most of the poison is in its organs,
like the liver.

50
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,411
Yes. It was the skin and flesh.

51
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,916
The flesh shouldn't contain
that much poison…

52
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,627
There might be poison in the flesh

53
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,421
depending on the type of fish
and its environment…

54
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:18,967
This case doesn't seem strange.

55
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,762
The thing is… In both this case
and the one ten years ago,

56
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:27,725
the chef insists he didn't use
any puffer fish in the food.

57
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,144
Oh? That's interesting.

58
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,313
There are more similarities.

59
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,774
<i>Both victims…</i>

60
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,402
<i>The government official and the merchant</i>

61
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,738
<i>both loved fine dining and delicacies.</i>

62
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:44,993
<i>They ate raw fish often,</i>

63
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,245
<i>and loved puffer fish.</i>

64
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,291
<i>After they collapsed, they found</i>
<i>all the fish organs and skin</i>

65
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,460
<i>in the kitchen trash,</i>

66
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,547
<i>so it was proven they didn't eat</i>
<i>the liver.</i>

67
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:01,426
<i>Both the chefs from the two cases</i>
<i>claim that</i>

68
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,595
<i>the puffer fish was used for dinner</i>
<i>the previous night</i>

69
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,765
<i>and that they used different fish</i>
<i>for the fish and vegetables dish,</i>

70
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,726
<i>to assert their innocence.</i>

71
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,979
<i>But there were no witnesses</i>
<i>to their claims.</i>

72
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,899
<i>30 minutes after the government official</i>
<i>finished his meal,</i>

73
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,068
<i>he developed symptoms of poisoning,</i>
<i>collapsed,</i>

74
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,071
<i>and was found going into convulsions.</i>

75
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,200
<i>I didn't expect them to investigate</i>
<i>this thoroughly…</i>

76
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,786
<i>There are many good-for-nothing</i>
<i>bureaucrats</i>

77
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,122
<i>who investigate carelessly</i>
<i>and make up a culprit…</i>

78
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,833
What do you think?

79
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,753
The symptoms align with
puffer fish poison.

80
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,130
But I don't have enough details…

81
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,844
Sir Gaoshun,
could you collect more information?

82
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,347
Of course. I'll investigate more.

83
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,063
<i>During this time of the year,</i>

84
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,858
<i>it's not rare for cooks to leave out</i>
<i>food waste for a few days.</i>

85
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,694
<i>They claim to have used another fish.</i>

86
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,114
<i>They found some fish scraps,</i>
<i>so it makes sense…</i>

87
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,616
What were you talking about?

88
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,620
That face is pretty hurtful, even for me.

89
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:18,086
You were listening to Gaoshun
very intently.

90
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,340
Most people listen intently
when it's an interesting conversation.

91
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,343
Hey, wait a minute. You often cut me off…

92
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,887
All right, then. It's late.

93
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,388
I'll be going home.

94
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,724
Hey, I'm not done talking to you…

95
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,726
Hey, now. Don't move.

96
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,230
Stay still, all right?

97
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,322
Xiaomao. About that case…

98
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,159
Here is the recipe.

99
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,203
The servants say that

100
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,873
most recipes served to their patron
are recorded here.

101
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,125
Thank you.

102
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:05,550
"Add shredded vegetables to parboiled fish
and mix with vinegar."

103
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:09,595
There's nothing strange about this recipe.

104
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,974
There are several types of
vinegar mixture combinations,

105
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,351
but the ingredient list is not specific.

106
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,645
Probably because the fish and vegetables

107
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,440
they can obtain depends on the season.

108
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,650
But with this recipe,

109
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,945
we don't know what they used in the dish.

110
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,364
You don't know?

111
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,701
<i>Looks like he wants to join.</i>

112
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,413
What is it that you don't know?

113
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,168
You haven't eaten your meal yet.

114
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,878
I know.

115
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,881
<i>He's being very childish.</i>

116
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,510
-When did this occur?
-About a week ago.

117
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,890
So did they use winter vegetables
in the dish,

118
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,309
like radishes and carrots?

119
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,854
They say they used seaweed.

120
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,856
Seaweed?

121
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,524
Yes, seaweed.

122
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,444
<i>If they like delicacies,</i>

123
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,113
<i>they might have used some rare seaweed.</i>

124
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:16,287
Is it possible to take a look
inside that home's kitchen?

125
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,679
Sir Gaoshun told me to come here…

126
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,099
So I've heard. I'm Basen.

127
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,476
I'm Maomao.

128
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,436
We're going to the mansion now,

129
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,522
but starting here, you're my "servant."

130
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:47,193
-Okay? Don't try anything silly.
-Yes, sir.

131
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,576
Once we arrive, the mansion's servant
will show you around the kitchen.

132
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,827
Yes, sir.

133
00:08:56,911 --> 00:09:00,289
<i>As expected of Sir Gaoshun. He works fast.</i>

134
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,415
<i>Speaking of…</i>

135
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,085
<i>I haven't seen this soldier before.</i>

136
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,712
<i>He reminds me of someone…</i>

137
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,925
<i>Looks like he doesn't like me very much.</i>

138
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,677
<i>Whatever.</i>

139
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,517
Here is the kitchen.

140
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:27,024
We haven't used it since the poisoning.

141
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,530
Hey!

142
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,742
Don't come in here! Get out!

143
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,996
What are you doing?
Did you bring them here?

144
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,833
We got permission from the lady.

145
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,626
This is our job.

146
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,962
Is that true?

147
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,423
Can we enter?

148
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,133
Or would that cause an inconvenience?

149
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,468
Do as you like.

150
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:58,681
Who is that?

151
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,183
He is our patron's younger brother.

152
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,769
After Patron went into a coma,

153
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,188
the lady has been
bedridden from exhaustion,

154
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,526
and his brother has been managing
this mansion.

155
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,528
I see.

156
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,114
-Sir Basen?
-Yeah.

157
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:21,078
<i>Seems like the chef already cleaned</i>
<i>the cooking supplies.</i>

158
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,415
<i>Other than that…</i>

159
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,302
What is this?

160
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,554
Oh, that's what Patron likes.

161
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,766
It was his favorite. He ate it often.

162
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,268
So I don't think it's poisonous…

163
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,480
<i>Doesn't look like he's lying.</i>

164
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,190
You got that?

165
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,567
Are you done? Leave already.

166
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,819
Yes, we're done.

167
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,034
Sorry for the trouble.

168
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,998
Why did you back down so easily?

169
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,334
Oh, I don't think I backed down.

170
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,838
You brought that here?

171
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,092
This is really strange.

172
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,595
It's too early in the season to get
this seaweed.

173
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,431
But it's not something
that'll last this long

174
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,309
even after it's been soaked in salt.

175
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,019
I see.

176
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:31,065
I don't think it was caught around here.

177
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:35,319
Maybe it was imported from the south
through trade, or….

178
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,657
It would be nice if we can find out
where it was imported from.

179
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:45,788
<i>Looks like he got it.</i>

180
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:49,583
So now, it's time for me to do my job.

181
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,176
What is this?

182
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,179
I brought this seaweed from the mansion.

183
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,808
I divided them into two
and soaked them in water.

184
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:09,562
<i>Why is Sir Jinshi here?</i>

185
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,563
I looked into it.

186
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,525
The seaweed was imported from the south.

187
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,610
According to servants,

188
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:20,948
their patron didn't usually eat
this seaweed in the winter.

189
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,075
The cooks also said

190
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,953
it's the same type of seaweed
they use all the time,

191
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,455
and it's not poisonous.

192
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:32,084
Just because it's the same seaweed
doesn't mean it's not poisonous.

193
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,045
Perhaps it's not customary

194
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:38,215
to eat this seaweed in the south.

195
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:44,722
What if a merchant learned this is
a foodie bureaucrat's favorite,

196
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:49,477
and had the locals make a salted seaweed
in order to make money?

197
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,104
Why would that be a problem?

198
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,356
In this world, there are ways

199
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,859
to make poisonous things not poisonous.

200
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,280
<i>For example, eels are poisonous</i>
<i>in their natural state.</i>

201
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:05,117
<i>But you can draw their blood or cook them</i>
<i>to make them edible.</i>

202
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,495
As for this seaweed,

203
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,915
it needs to be soaked in limewater.

204
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:15,211
What we have here is seaweed
soaked in limewater,

205
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,379
and seaweed not soaked in limewater.

206
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,257
What are you doing!

207
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,426
I should be fine… I think.

208
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,220
What do you mean, you think?

209
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:28,182
Don't worry. I have an emetic right here.

210
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,392
That's not something to be proud of!

211
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,102
-Gaoshun!
-Hey!

212
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,354
Wait…

213
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:34,772
Throw up!

214
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,904
<i>I was going to test</i>
<i>whether a one-night soak</i>

215
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,073
<i>would get rid of the poison…</i>

216
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,992
All right, let's reconvene.

217
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,411
Here's a question.

218
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:54,250
Who was the person
who asked the trader to bring

219
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,501
the salted seaweed?

220
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,964
If it was the Patron himself
who ordered it, then it's his own fault.

221
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,884
But if it wasn't…

222
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:08,264
Importing ingredients
from an area where they don't eat it

223
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,683
is always risky, isn't it?

224
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,519
I understand.

225
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,897
<i>Everyone here is quick-witted.</i>

226
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,233
<i>I don't need to say more.</i>

227
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,028
<i>Looks like this case is closed…</i>

228
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,582
The culprit was
the official's younger brother.

229
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,710
Once we found who the seller was,

230
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,879
he confessed and said he bought it.

231
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,468
He said he did it because he felt
overlooked as the younger brother,

232
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,680
and wanted to get rid
of the older brother.

233
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,890
Tale as old as time.

234
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:56,562
But how did a man who attempted murder
for such a shallow reason

235
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,231
find out about the poison in the seaweed?

236
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:04,695
<i>Apparently he learned it by chance</i>
<i>from someone next to him at a pub.</i>

237
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,115
"By chance," huh…?

238
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:17,666
In the end, I didn't get to eat
the poisonous seaweed…

239
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,586
<i>But what should I make with that?</i>

240
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:24,840
<i>That brown mushroom growing out of</i>
<i>the dried insect…</i>

241
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,550
<i>Medicinal alcohol?</i>

242
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,552
<i>Or pills?</i>

243
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,683
Welcome home, sir!

244
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:39,146
Welcome home… home… home…

245
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,068
Huh?

246
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,863
What's going on?

247
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,157
<i>This isn't my fault.</i>

248
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,413
You look tired, Young Master.

249
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,916
I have a lot of work left…

250
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,043
But there's someone
I can't get along with.

251
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,878
We disagree on everything.

252
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,715
So there are people even you can't
get along with, Sir Jinshi?

253
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:10,970
He's a very intelligent
high military official.

254
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,056
He's from a good family,

255
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,475
but won't marry even though he's over 40.

256
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:20,354
He adopted his nephew
and has him managing the household.

257
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,605
He's a famous eccentric.

258
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,732
<i>Over 40…</i>

259
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,444
<i>A high military official… An eccentric?</i>

260
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,572
His only interests are

261
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,158
Go, chess, and gossip.

262
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,245
He nitpicks and barges in

263
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:39,707
so that he can extend the deadline
to sign off on cases.

264
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,835
Looks like I'm his next target.

265
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,547
He sits in my office every day…

266
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,968
<i>Okay. I'm going to forget about this.</i>

267
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,178
<i>Remembering won't do me any good.</i>

268
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,309
<i>But even if I try to forget,</i>

269
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,021
<i>my bad feelings usually come true…</i>

270
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,898
We already signed off on the case.

271
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,526
It's hard to see flowers in the winter.

272
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,112
That's why I'm here. For the flowers.

273
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,407
<i>This man's name is Lakan.</i>

274
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,534
<i>He's a general.</i>

275
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,619
<i>Looks like he's pestering me</i>

276
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:22,499
<i>because I hired Maomao, who has</i>
<i>connections to The Verdigris House.</i>

277
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,960
Speaking of,

278
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,921
I have an old friend
from The Verdigris House.

279
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,424
<i>That's unexpected.</i>

280
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,177
<i>I assumed he wasn't interested in</i>
<i>this sort of thing.</i>

281
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,429
Who was this courtesan?

282
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,725
<i>I didn't mean to ask.</i>

283
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,644
She was a good courtesan.

284
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,313
She was good at Go and chess.

285
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:48,317
I could beat her at chess,
but I always lost at Go.

286
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:53,489
To beat you, Sir General,
she must've been good.

287
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,574
I didn't think I could meet

288
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,496
a more interesting woman than her,
so I considered buying her out.

289
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,374
But the world isn't that easy.

290
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,961
Two rich men with unique preferences

291
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,506
kept raising her price,
like it was a bidding war.

292
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,508
How unfortunate.

293
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,344
<i>Buying out a courtesan could cost</i>

294
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,514
<i>as much as building a whole villa.</i>

295
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,058
She was a really strange courtesan…

296
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,521
<i>What is he trying to get at,</i>
<i>talking about this?</i>

297
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,565
She was skilled, but didn't sell her body.

298
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,860
She doesn't even think of customers
as customers.

299
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:37,116
<i>Even when pouring tea to customers,</i>
<i>she had an arrogant look,</i>

300
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,409
<i>as if she was giving alms</i>
<i>to a lowly peasant.</i>

301
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:44,289
But there are men that get infatuated
by that sort of thing.

302
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,210
I was one of those men.

303
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:53,507
<i>It sent shivers down my spine. So divine!</i>

304
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,931
I wanted to have her one day.

305
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,229
I couldn't give up on her.

306
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,357
So I used a bit of a dirty trick.

307
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,778
-A dirty trick?
-I couldn't afford her.

308
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,739
So I just needed to lower her price.

309
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,534
I decreased her scarcity value.

310
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,080
Want to know how?

311
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,458
You said this much, and you won't tell me?

312
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,719
Before that, I have a favor to ask.

313
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,680
What is it?

314
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:46,685
I heard you recently hired
a very interesting maid.

315
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,063
I hear she's good at solving mysteries.

316
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:59,156
I had a friend
who was the court purveyor goldsmith.

317
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,242
He passed away the other day,

318
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,828
without assigning a successor.

319
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:09,625
He had three children
that were his apprentices,

320
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:15,047
but he died without telling them
his secret technique, those poor things.

321
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,549
It seems like his mysterious will

322
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,510
is some kind of clue.

323
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,263
This has been bothering me for a bit.

324
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,642
What are you trying to say?

325
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,020
It's nothing, really.

326
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:35,234
I'm just wondering if it's possible
to know what this secret technique is.

327
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,986
For example,

328
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,951
perhaps your clever maid
could take a look.

329
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,290
Before I say anything,

330
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:53,460
please tell me the details.

331
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,386
<i>It's pouring.</i>
