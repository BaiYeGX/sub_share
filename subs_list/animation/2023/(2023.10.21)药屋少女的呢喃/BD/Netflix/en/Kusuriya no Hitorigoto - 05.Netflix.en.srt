ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,927
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,386
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,057
I accept my loss.

5
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,522
-You've improved, Basen.
-No.

6
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,984
I merely push through with force.

7
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,069
I'm still no match for you, Sir Jinshi.

8
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,822
But that is a great force you have.

9
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,782
As expected from the Ma clan.

10
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,204
So how is she, Gaoshun?

11
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,581
The apothecary, I mean.

12
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,292
How do you mean?

13
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,836
Has she gained a little weight?

14
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,838
She's slowly gaining it back.

15
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,216
I see. However…

16
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,803
Do you even know why this was forbidden?

17
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,388
I'm saying it's poison, damn it!

18
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,725
I never imagined she had such
a side to her.

19
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,185
Are you all right?

20
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,023
-What? Why?
-You worry about her quite a lot.

21
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,030
No, it's nothing.

22
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,707
I knew it was here!

23
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,669
All right!

24
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,631
Another one!

25
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,132
Here too?

26
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,178
Where should I eat this? In the kitchen?

27
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:43,139
But it'd be troublesome if they ask
where I got this…

28
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,099
Oh, before that…

29
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,478
Wow, it looks so good!

30
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,314
Thanks for doing this again, Maomao!

31
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,484
The other attendants are so kind
to share dim sum

32
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,445
each time we have tea together!

33
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,906
Eat more!

34
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,741
You need to get more fat.

35
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,618
Don't be shy!

36
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:09,082
-Oh, did you hear?
-Huh?

37
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,625
An Imperial Court palace woman

38
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,545
succeeded in seducing a eunuch
who's famous for hating women!

39
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,047
I see.

40
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,841
-How do you think she did it?
-I have no idea.

41
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,135
She used a stimulant potion!

42
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,137
Stimulant potion?

43
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:28,977
<i>It's that one.</i>

44
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,853
What's wrong, Maomao?

45
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,522
Oh, it's nothing.

46
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,691
It's probably unrelated. I think…

47
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,237
Good morning.

48
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,157
Hey, miss! What do you need today?

49
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,035
I have something to ask you in confidence.

50
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,287
What is it?

51
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,747
-It's this.
-Wow!

52
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,125
It's the first <i>matsutake</i> mushroom
of the year!

53
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,669
I'm glad you seem to like these.

54
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,629
We need coal!

55
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,299
I'll also bring some soy paste and salt!

56
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,550
<i>All in all,</i>

57
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:04,679
<i>I've built a good relationship</i>
<i>with the quack doctor.</i>

58
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,810
This is the stuff!

59
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,437
It looks ready now.

60
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,940
Drizzle some soy paste, add a little salt…

61
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,484
Here you are.

62
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,489
It's so good!

63
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,742
Now, we're partners in crime.

64
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,370
So delicious!

65
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,122
Doctor!

66
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,167
Could you…?

67
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,420
Make something to cure my curse?

68
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,421
A curse?

69
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,215
-What is this about?
-It's this.

70
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,263
That's a pretty bad rash.

71
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,265
Maybe some ointment first?

72
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,309
Will you make me some?

73
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,393
Sure.

74
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,022
So, what is this curse?

75
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:00,068
This happened in the evening
two nights ago.

76
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,904
<i>The trash produced</i>

77
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,323
<i>in the rear palace is burned in the fire</i>
<i>on the west.</i>

78
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,076
<i>I was working that night</i>
<i>like always, then…</i>

79
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,746
What is it?

80
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:18,127
A woman's clothing? The sleeves are burnt.

81
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,213
And is this a wood tablet?

82
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:23,007
<i>It bothered me a little,</i>

83
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,135
<i>but I threw them in the fire as is.</i>
<i>But then…</i>

84
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,736
It's a curse!
That's why my hands are like this…

85
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,158
Was the flame you saw this color?

86
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,330
If not this, then this.

87
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,251
I can make this one too.

88
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,463
Miss, what is this?

89
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,715
It works the same way as fireworks.

90
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,802
Some things can change
the color of the flame when it burns.

91
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:09,971
So what about this hand?

92
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,808
<i>My guess is something was attached</i>
<i>to the wood tablet.</i>

93
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,478
The rash came from
coming into contact with that.

94
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,815
Apply this ointment and see if it works.

95
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,775
Thank you very much.

96
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,194
Her medicine always works well!

97
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,612
You'll get better in no time!

98
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,825
Wonderful. As expected of the apothecary.

99
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,077
Sir Jinshi!

100
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,789
I'll prepare some tea right away.

101
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,169
How do you do, Sir Jinshi?

102
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,420
Did you need something?

103
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:46,382
Are you saying I can't talk to you
if I don't need something?

104
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,759
No, not at all.

105
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,138
Come with me.

106
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,391
Here you are, Sir Jinshi…

107
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,108
How many colors are there?

108
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,777
I don't know the exact number.

109
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,406
How do you apply the color, then?

110
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,826
With salt, you can apply color
by dissolving it in water.

111
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,369
I know there are certain dyes

112
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,206
that dissolve with things like oil,
not water.

113
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,292
But this isn't my area of expertise,
so I don't know.

114
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,251
I see.

115
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,588
If we're finished here, I'll be off.

116
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,340
Wait.

117
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,009
What is it?

118
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:31,886
I love mushrooms too.

119
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,558
I'm expecting good work, Apothecary.

120
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,644
<i>So he knew…</i>

121
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:44,023
I'll go out tomorrow… To look for them…

122
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,825
Search for those who've suffered
a burn to their arm recently.

123
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,577
Understood, sir.

124
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,207
A colored wood tablet is probably a code…

125
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,418
Do they go through the trouble
of making a code

126
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,754
because the information can't be
made public?

127
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,339
But what could that be…?

128
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,677
It's not my business, really.

129
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,346
It's nothing a poison tester should
meddle in.

130
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,642
Thank you.

131
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,728
That one goes there.

132
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,689
I'm back.

133
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,941
Welcome home…

134
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,318
Maomao! Perfect timing.

135
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,280
Can you put this on?

136
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,323
<i>I have a bad feeling…</i>

137
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,704
What is this?

138
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:43,791
The costume for the garden party,
obviously!

139
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,167
The garden party?

140
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,712
Twice a year, the Emperor
and the higher-ups gather

141
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,964
at the court garden to enjoy

142
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,882
performances and a meal.

143
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,177
The Emperor isn't married yet,

144
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,846
so he has no consort.

145
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:58,973
In that case,

146
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:02,393
He is to take
the highest status concubines.

147
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,729
Highest status concubine…

148
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:09,233
The most likely candidates for the
next consort, the high-ranking concubines.

149
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,360
<i>The highest ranking concubines…</i>

150
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,779
<i>The four high-ranking concubines.</i>

151
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,032
<i>The Precious Concubine,</i>
<i>Concubine Gyokuyou.</i>

152
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,159
<i>The Wise Concubine, Concubine Lihua.</i>

153
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,328
<i>The Virtuous Concubine, Concubine Lishu.</i>

154
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,121
<i>The Pure Concubine, Concubine Ah-Duo.</i>

155
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,374
At the last party,
Ladies Gyokuyou and Lihua

156
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,793
were absent because they were
heavily pregnant.

157
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:30,713
So this time,
all four ladies are to gather!

158
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,215
So what are we doing there?

159
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,177
Nothing, really.

160
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,766
We're the guests invited to this party,

161
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:44,310
so we just have to stay with the Emperor.

162
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,271
Sometimes, the officials come to greet us.

163
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,774
So don't forget to smile.

164
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,904
Is everyone to attend?

165
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,781
Of course!

166
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,575
The first showing of Princess Lingli,

167
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,036
the four ladies gathering…
This year is important!

168
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,665
This is a war! We have to take this on!

169
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,501
Let's do this!

170
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,005
<i>Lady Gyokuyou already has</i>
<i>very few attendants.</i>

171
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,841
<i>A newcomer can't be absent…</i>

172
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:20,096
<i>And if there are meals,</i>
<i>the poison tester needs to be there.</i>

173
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,724
We should stuff your chest area.

174
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,685
I'll also add a bit to your hips.
Is that okay?

175
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,728
I'll let you decide.

176
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,357
The makeup will be impeccable too!

177
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,861
We have to hide those freckles sometimes.

178
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,116
Watching performances outdoors

179
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,993
where it's windy, eating meals,

180
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,872
smiling at the officials who come our way…

181
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:51,252
My bladder will need to be
as strong as iron.

182
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,503
In that case…

183
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,807
This should work.

184
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,559
It smells so good!

185
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,103
What are you making?

186
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,064
-I'm making ginger and orange candy.
-Candy?

187
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,359
Orange peels improve blood flow

188
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,029
and ginger can warm the body.

189
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,365
Is this for the garden party?

190
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:25,244
Yes. I also made this.

191
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,414
I sewed a pocket to my undershirt.

192
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,750
If I place warming stones inside,
I won't get as cold.

193
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,836
-Maomao!
-Huh?

194
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,964
Please, will you make that for everyone?

195
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,550
Yes, ma'am…

196
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,264
<i>Once you get used to customs,</i>

197
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,726
<i>I guess you don't think about</i>
<i>these small things.</i>

198
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:53,564
<i>A little creativity can go a long way.</i>

199
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,651
-Come in.
-Please make one for me too.

200
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,571
-Me too…
-Yes, sir.

201
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,866
Can you show me how to make that?

202
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,242
Please!

203
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,829
<i>The seamstress in charge of</i>
<i>the Emperor's clothes and His chef…</i>

204
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,902
Wow, so cold!

205
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,335
I'm finally finished!

206
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,922
<i>Tomorrow's the big day.</i>

207
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:06,053
I'll make that just in case.

208
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:10,057
About the search for those with
burns on their arm…

209
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,018
You haven't found them yet?

210
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,564
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,315
The garden party…

212
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,569
I hope nothing happens there…

213
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,175
You're so beautiful, Lady Gyokuyou!

214
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:47,720
Red suits you so well!

215
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,389
How beautiful she is…

216
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,684
So it's true that she looks the best
in red in this whole country.

217
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,021
You're more beautiful than anyone.

218
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,692
Thank you, everyone.
And these are for you.

219
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,029
I need to leave my mark

220
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,364
so that no one unsavory targets you.

221
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,117
Maomao.

222
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,162
Listen, Maomao.

223
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,706
You're my attendant, okay?

224
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,712
Thank you so much, my lady.

225
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:23,213
Got you!

226
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,550
Um, well…

227
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,636
Let's do your makeup!

228
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,221
Go be your cutest self.

229
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,682
I'll wipe your face and apply perfume oil.

230
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,100
And those freckles of yours…

231
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,727
Here we go!

232
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,107
-Huh?
-Maomao?

233
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,401
-No way!
-Why?

234
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,861
Maomao, you…

235
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,366
<i>Dang. They know now.</i>

236
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,036
All right. Let's go.

237
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,684
All right, then, Concubine Lishu.
See you later.

238
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,394
Yes!

239
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,854
Sir Jinshi…

240
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,906
Last up is the Precious Concubine,
Concubine Gyokuyou.

241
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,328
<i>Is his commitment to</i>
<i>Concubine Gyokuyou strong</i>

242
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,456
<i>because he found a toy he likes?</i>

243
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,668
<i>What can I do with him?</i>

244
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,591
Maomao, you helped us out a lot.

245
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,719
I'm happy to be of use.

246
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,013
How do you do, Concubine Gyokuyou?

247
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,222
How do you do?

248
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,684
You look beautiful in red as always,
Concubine Gyokuyou.

249
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,646
While decorative,
you look somewhat mystical.

250
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,275
It's probably due to your beautiful
green eyes, Concubine Gyokuyou.

251
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,485
Thank you.

252
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,868
All right, so how is the princess doing?

253
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,379
How do you do, Sir Jinshi?

254
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,385
Oh, oh… It's you, Apothecary.

255
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,262
You're wearing foundation?

256
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,014
No, I'm not.

257
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:38,932
But your freckles are gone.

258
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,934
Because I got rid of them.

259
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,895
With makeup, right?

260
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,355
They went away
because I removed my makeup.

261
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,402
You're not making any sense.

262
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,904
You're contradicting yourself.

263
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,655
<i>Oh, this is a pain.</i>

264
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>I should've just said yes.</i>

265
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,785
I was applying makeup daily,

266
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,371
using dried clay to draw the freckles on.

267
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:05,501
What you've been seeing every day
is my face with makeup.

268
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,213
Makeup isn't simply for
making someone beautiful.

269
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,757
Why do such a thing?

270
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,260
You really want to know?

271
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:19,306
It's so that I'm not dragged away
to a back alley.

272
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:25,145
<i>Even in the pleasure district,</i>
<i>there are men starving for women.</i>

273
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:28,398
<i>Broke men, violent men,</i>
<i>and men with venereal diseases.</i>

274
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:34,154
<i>A small, scraggy and ugly woman</i>
<i>would rarely be a target.</i>

275
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,615
Has that happened to you?

276
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,117
It was just an attempt.

277
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,911
I was carried off by kidnappers instead.

278
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,750
My makeup was falling off.

279
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,420
They thought that maybe I could be sold.

280
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,922
I see…

281
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,426
I apologize for my poor management.

282
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,971
It doesn't matter.

283
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,599
Whether it's illegal kidnapping,
or legally selling off children,

284
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:05,018
it's all the same to those who buy.

285
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,272
This doesn't infuriate you?

286
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:11,024
Of course it does.

287
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,111
But it's not your fault, Sir Jinshi.

288
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,533
I'm sorry…

289
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,704
<i>He's being meek. That's rare.</i>

290
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,129
That hurts.

291
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,883
I see. It's for you.

292
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,387
I'll see you at the party.

293
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,770
Huh?

294
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,318
<i>A man's hair clip?</i>

295
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,903
<i>But why…?</i>

296
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,489
-So cool!
-I'm so jealous!

297
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,575
I want one too!

298
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,286
I don't mind giving it,
but how can I share it?

299
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,581
You already broke my promise?

300
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,540
Huh?

301
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,755
You're not just my attendant anymore.

302
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,427
What does that mean…?

303
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,472
It's time.

304
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,001
