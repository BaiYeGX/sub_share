ORIGINAL STORY BY NATSU HYUUGA

2
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,884
{\an8}THIS STORY IS A FICION, AND ALL NAMES OF
FIGURES ND ORGANIZATIONS ARE FICTITIOUS.

3
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,385
{\an8}MOREOVER, THE STORY HAS NO RELATION
TO REAL-LIFE INCIDENTS AND EVENTS.

4
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,930
<i>It was around the first spring breeze</i>

5
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,934
<i>that Lady Gyokuyou’s</i>
<i>pregnancy became a certainty.</i>

6
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,106
Hi!

7
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:50,360
<i>How mysterious.</i>
<i>Can she tell that there’s a baby inside?</i>

8
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,826
{\an8}So cute!

9
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,161
{\an8}I should start thinking about marriage…

10
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,253
<i>Even if she gets proposed to,</i>
<i>they’ll try their best to stop it.</i>

11
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,090
<i>Being too good at your job can</i>
<i>be a problem.</i>

12
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:21,850
<i>When your days are busy,</i>
<i>time passes quickly.</i>

13
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:26,187
<i>Although the two months I spent</i>
<i>with Sir Jinshi felt like forever.</i>

14
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:32,861
Do you want to draw again?

15
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,612
Yeah!

16
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,329
This is woolly milkcap.
It's a poisonous mushroom.

17
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,082
Draw a regular flower.

18
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,002
<i>A regular flower, huh?</i>

19
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,256
{\an8}Blue roses?

20
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:56,509
{\an8}Yes. You don't know them?

21
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>The blue petals stimulate the eyes.</i>

22
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,807
They're very beautiful.

23
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,227
They used to be decorated
all around the court.

24
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,688
Perhaps you were dreaming.

25
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,232
Blue roses don’t exist.

26
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,028
But they do.

27
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:20,199
I’d love to enjoy them again.

28
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:23,786
What do you think? Could you pull it off?

29
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:28,207
I thought there was nothing
you couldn't achieve.

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,959
I understand.

31
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:34,172
If such roses exist,
I’d love to see them myself.

32
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,548
So it’s decided.

33
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,760
I'm truly looking forward to it.

34
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,262
Good day, sir.

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,769
I’ll see you at next month’s garden party.

36
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,982
You’re already so busy.

37
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,527
-Did you need to take this on?
-Don’t talk about that.

38
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,781
Start by talking to flower shops
around the country.

39
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:10,250
The flower shops explained that
roses are out of season right now.

40
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:16,089
I’m sorry for calling upon you
so suddenly.

41
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:22,178
There’s a plan to view blue roses soon.

42
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,389
Blue roses?

43
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,766
I work with medicine.

44
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,559
Yes, I know that.

45
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,523
<i>Is he in some kind of trouble?</i>
<i>He looks tired.</i>

46
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,858
<i>Roses, huh?</i>

47
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,152
<i>I have some knowledge, but…</i>

48
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,406
<i>I’ve worked with roses</i>

49
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,158
<i>to earn pocket money</i>
<i>from courtesans. However…</i>

50
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,662
He really said he saw blue roses?

51
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,080
Yes.

52
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,042
He didn’t use any hallucinogens?

53
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,545
If such a thing was common,
the empire would fall apart!

54
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,297
Sir Jinshi.

55
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,509
Is it impossible?

56
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,974
What do I need to do exactly?

57
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,144
Can you have them
by next month’s garden party?

58
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:12,937
Next month?

59
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,441
Roses don’t bloom
for at least two more months.

60
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:17,984
You’re right.

61
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,571
I’ll tell him I can’t.

62
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,533
<i>Sir Jinshi’s reaction.</i>

63
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:29,370
<i>This impossible task and pushy tactic…</i>

64
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:34,375
Could it be that this request
came from a certain military man?

65
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,087
That’s right.

66
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,840
All right. I accept this job.

67
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,675
Really?

68
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,511
I don’t know if I can do it,
but I’ll do what I can.

69
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,973
<i>I don't want to be running away</i>
<i>from him forever.</i>

70
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,688
<i>I'd love to crack</i>
<i>that smirking monocle of his.</i>

71
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,191
Sir Jinshi.

72
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,319
Can I request some items from you?

73
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,074
Thank you for giving me permission
to use these,

74
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,285
-Lady Lihua.
-It was no trouble.

75
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,288
It was originally something you had made.

76
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,291
<i>It brings me back.</i>

77
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,920
<i>I requested a steam bath to be made</i>

78
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,214
<i>to help Lady Lihua recover from poison.</i>

79
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,008
<i>I'll be borrowing the bath for this job,</i>

80
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:26,219
<i>but I would feel bad</i>
<i>borrowing it for free.</i>

81
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,639
This is the Emperor's favorite text.

82
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,308
Thank you. This will help.

83
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,813
<i>I'm glad I had it delivered</i>
<i>from the brothel.</i>

84
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,736
-Take care of that.
-Yes, sir!

85
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,404
Sir Jinshi.

86
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,406
Oh, you're here.

87
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,952
I had this made, like you asked.
But what is it for?

88
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,621
I'm going to confuse the roses.

89
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,373
Confuse the roses?

90
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,625
What does that mean, Apothecary?

91
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,092
I'll add some sunlight

92
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,678
and add some steam into the shed
from there.

93
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,391
We'll grow the roses in a warm room.

94
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,812
The flowers may bloom
ahead of season this way.

95
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,149
So that's what you mean by
confusing the roses.

96
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,151
I'm not certain this will work, though.

97
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,956
Maomao!

98
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,917
-Xiaolan?
-I'll help too.

99
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,670
How's your injured foot?

100
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,257
<i>Is he a chaperone?</i>

101
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,095
<i>They kept saying</i>

102
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,806
<i>not to push myself repeatedly.</i>

103
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,392
I'm all right. Thanks for coming to help.

104
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,811
Not at all. It's been so long
since I worked with you!

105
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,565
You're right.

106
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,821
<i>We carried in more than 100 pots of roses.</i>

107
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,327
This is the last one.

108
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,039
Wow, there are so many!

109
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,916
<i>We got different types of roses,</i>

110
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,251
<i>and selected species that bloom</i>
<i>earlier in the year.</i>

111
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,586
You think they'll all bloom?

112
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,589
I hope so.

113
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,854
<i>We take great care</i>
<i>in maintaining the temperature.</i>

114
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,441
<i>A few people were sent to help us,</i>

115
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,236
<i>but it's a hard task to leave</i>
<i>to someone else.</i>

116
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,404
<i>If you make a mistake</i>

117
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,990
<i>and all the flowers die,</i>
<i>then everything is over.</i>

118
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,541
<i>We put the flowers out on sunny days</i>
<i>so they can absorb sunlight.</i>

119
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,628
Looks like they like the sun!

120
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:07,463
Yeah.

121
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,006
How is it going?

122
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,759
I brought some food.

123
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,390
Thank you.

124
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:23,354
This is great! I don't have to work,
and we get snacks!

125
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,648
This is work too.

126
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,069
What's wrong?

127
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,238
I don't know. Maybe they're just curious.

128
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,408
<i>Or, are they trying to see</i>
<i>something scary?</i>

129
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,746
What should we do next?

130
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,207
If there are seedlings with too many buds,

131
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,584
can you pluck some out?

132
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,254
That way, the nutrients gather in one spot
making it easier to bloom

133
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,256
and protects it from diseases.

134
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,222
It's totally fine!

135
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,186
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all!

136
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:09,400
Hurry up!

137
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:20,244
They're not budding yet.

138
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,418
<i>On the days the cold returns,</i>

139
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,759
<i>we keep the shed warm all night.</i>

140
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,018
<i>The weather is unpredictable.</i>

141
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,658
You didn't sleep again yesterday?

142
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,494
I slept at dawn.

143
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,704
That was only moments ago!

144
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,083
I'll do what I can here,
so you should sleep just a little.

145
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:09,377
I should keep an eye on them.

146
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,836
What?

147
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,381
They're looking over here again.

148
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,593
<i>They do this every day!</i>
<i>Don't they get tired of it?</i>

149
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,720
<i>It's very distracting.</i>

150
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,556
<i>If only I could divert their attention…</i>

151
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,688
Wow!

152
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,650
So these are rouge nails!

153
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,277
Everyone at the pleasure district
does these.

154
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,154
They're very beautiful!

155
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,167
You do your nails too, Maomao?

156
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,169
They're so cute!

157
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,381
They're very trendy these days.

158
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:56,590
Yes, they are.

159
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,595
<i>High-ranking concubines who receive</i>
<i>the Emperor's affections</i>

160
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,806
<i>are the creators of fashion trends.</i>

161
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,855
They're very inefficient.

162
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,068
<i>Ms. Hongniang cares more about work</i>
<i>than fashion.</i>

163
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,657
I'm done with the food testing,
so I'll head back to the Crystal Pavilion.

164
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,950
So soon?

165
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,286
There's not much time left
until the garden party.

166
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,163
That's true.

167
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,290
That reminds me.

168
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,626
Lady Gyokuyou
will not be attending this party.

169
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,963
She'll be giving up her seat so that
Lady Loulan can introduce herself.

170
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:39,091
<i>It must be to hide her pregnancy.</i>

171
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,510
I understand. Goodbye.

172
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,763
Hey, are you all right
at the Crystal pavilion?

173
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,391
You're getting skinnier by the day!

174
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,059
Don't push yourself, all right?

175
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,562
Thank you.

176
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,492
Maomao!

177
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,952
Maomao, come quickly!

178
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,751
It's budding.

179
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,252
I found it just now.

180
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,255
It's our first one!

181
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,550
<i>If everything goes as planned,</i>

182
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:24,720
<i>maybe they'll start to bloom…</i>

183
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:29,058
Maomao?

184
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,318
Any messages from the Apothecary?

185
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,195
No.

186
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,114
I haven't been able to drop by
for a few days.

187
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,576
We were both busy
preparing for the garden party.

188
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,665
Sir Jinshi.

189
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,614
That must be Sir Shishou's daughter,
Concubine Loulan.

190
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,162
How glamorous!

191
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,635
For Concubine Loulan.

192
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:53,100
If she has any shortcomings,

193
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,104
please let us know.

194
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,485
-Anything at all.
-Oh, dear.

195
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,708
-Blue roses?
-Could it be?

196
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,798
Perhaps it'll be agreeable

197
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,219
to enjoy these buds
and imagine what they will look like

198
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,304
when they bloom.

199
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,308
Yes. They are beautiful.

200
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:39,355
<i>These glances that are thrown at "Jinshi."</i>

201
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,400
<i>No matter how beautiful he may be,</i>

202
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,904
<i>no official is so unselfish that</i>
<i>they'd enjoy a young eunuch</i>

203
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,864
<i>showing off his abilities.</i>

204
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,952
<i>Lust is easy.</i>

205
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,579
<i>You can use it to your advantage.</i>

206
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,501
<i>Jealousy is easy. It's easy to manage.</i>

207
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,503
<i>What's bothersome is</i>

208
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,673
<i>when you can't read the emotion</i>
<i>behind those eyes.</i>

209
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:09,176
<i>Shishou. Concubine Loulan's father,</i>

210
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,220
<i>and the man who won</i>
<i>the empress's affection.</i>

211
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,765
<i>The emperor still owes much to him.</i>

212
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,686
<i>That's why our side continues to smile.</i>

213
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,940
<i>And right now, we have someone</i>
<i>more concerning than Shishou.</i>

214
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,318
<i>It's that man, Lakan.</i>

215
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,080
My, how disagreeable.

216
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,505
Are you awake?

217
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,424
Ms. Yinghua…

218
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,926
Don't go to the Crystal Pavilion anymore.

219
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,595
You always come back all skinny and tired.

220
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,141
I'm sorry.

221
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,684
You're awake?

222
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,981
I'll be going now.

223
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,444
Stay seated.

224
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,031
It was very hard.

225
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,116
We couldn't get them to bloom in time.

226
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:19,580
But it's not like
you wanted to impress me, did you?

227
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,748
Huh?

228
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,542
It's nothing. It was more than enough.

229
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,545
How did you achieve this?

230
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,214
I just dyed them.

231
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:31,842
You dyed them? But there's nothing there.

232
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:34,636
It's not dyed on the outside.

233
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,263
It's dyed from the inside.

234
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,437
These roses were all originally white.

235
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,233
<i>We used different types of colored water</i>

236
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,319
<i>and soaked the white buds in them.</i>

237
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:54,448
<i>So that's why there were many colors,</i>
<i>not just blue.</i>

238
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,409
<i>Yes. The leaves get muddy and dark</i>
<i>when they're dyed,</i>

239
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,828
<i>so we plucked them all in advance.</i>

240
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:04,291
<i>After that, we fixed some cotton</i>
<i>soaked with colored water so that</i>

241
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:08,337
<i>the color doesn't come off</i>
<i>during the garden party.</i>

242
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,047
<i>It's very simple.</i>

243
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,091
<i>In actuality,</i>

244
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,636
<i>The truly hard part was getting the roses</i>
<i>to bloom in time.</i>

245
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,138
Yes, it's very simple.

246
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,431
That's why there may be

247
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,102
officials who complain
and make accusations.

248
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:26,605
I explained the trick
to the Emperor in advance.

249
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,484
<i>He seemed to enjoy knowing</i>
<i>the secret beforehand,</i>

250
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,861
<i>and listened to me explain it</i>
<i>with interest.</i>

251
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:37,866
So why did he say
he used to see blue roses in the court?

252
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,618
There must've been some bored person

253
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:43,205
soaking blue-colored water
into the roses every day.

254
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,168
Why would they do such a thing?

255
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,003
Who knows?

256
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,923
Maybe they wanted something
to flirt with women with.

257
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,844
I haven't seen you with dyed nails before.

258
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,637
It doesn't suit me.

259
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:03,142
If I had some balsam or wood sorrel,
the dye would apply more evenly.

260
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,854
<i>Balsam are known as "rouge nails,"</i>

261
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,273
<i>and sorrel are known as "cat's feet."</i>

262
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:13,110
<i>If you rub these plants together, it makes</i>
<i>a vibrant red color for your nails..</i>

263
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,904
<i>Though a little nail dye</i>
<i>wouldn't change this…</i>

264
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,907
<i>At least it's better than it used to be.</i>

265
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,370
Sir Gaoshun, do you have
the requested items?

266
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,622
Yes, just as you asked.

267
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,916
Thank you, sir.

268
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,587
<i>Now, the stage is set.</i>

269
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,297
<i>All that's left is to</i>

270
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,926
<i>blow away that despicable man.</i>

271
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,725
<i>I didn't think that</i>
<i>the challenge would end in failure.</i>

272
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,737
<i>Most humans look like Go pieces to me.</i>

273
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,865
<i>Men are the black stones,</i>
<i>and women are the white stones.</i>

274
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,492
<i>Even the men who work</i>
<i>for me in the military</i>

275
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,828
<i>are all just</i> xiangqi <i>pieces.</i>

276
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,165
<i>Most are soldiers, or pawns.</i>

277
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:12,252
<i>As they rise up the ranks,</i>
<i>they become horses, or cannon.</i>

278
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,088
<i>Working in the military is quite simple.</i>

279
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:18,091
<i>You simply have to place the pieces</i>
<i>where they belong.</i>

280
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,510
<i>Everyone has their roles.</i>

281
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:23,263
<i>That's how you win most wars.</i>

282
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,682
<i>It's not difficult at all.</i>

283
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,895
<i>Even if you are unskilled,</i>
<i>as long as the pieces fulfill their roles,</i>

284
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,773
<i>they'll finish your job for you.</i>

285
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,401
<i>My eyes hurt more than usual.</i>

286
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:39,196
<i>I keep noticing red flickering around</i>
<i>in my vision.</i>

287
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,200
<i>Rouge nails, huh?</i>

288
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:48,247
<i>The rouge nails I remember</i>
<i>aren't a distasteful, flashy red.</i>

289
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,793
<i>It's a subtle red, dyed from balsam.</i>

290
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,344
