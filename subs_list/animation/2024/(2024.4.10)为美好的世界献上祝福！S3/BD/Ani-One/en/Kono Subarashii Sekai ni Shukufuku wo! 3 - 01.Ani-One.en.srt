1
00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:03,502
Dad. Mom.

2
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:05,312
I am Kazuma.

3
00:00:06,004 --> 00:00:08,905
I defeated the leaders of the Devil King's
Army who were a threat to the world…

4
00:00:08,906 --> 00:00:10,100
Oh my.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,873
This was mentioned in the previous letter.

6
00:00:11,874 --> 00:00:12,700
Sorry.

7
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:14,180
Exactly, exactly.

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,205
The world's women are enamored

9
00:00:15,206 --> 00:00:17,795
with me and say they want
to have my children

10
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:19,307
because I am so great.

11
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:21,103
Attractive women also passionately

12
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,700
seduce me.

13
00:00:24,106 --> 00:00:25,398
I might be able to show you

14
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,800
your grandson soon.

15
00:00:27,801 --> 00:00:31,105
Oh, it's Mr. Kazuma who defeated
leaders of Devil King's Army again.

16
00:00:31,106 --> 00:00:32,997
Mr. Kazuma, the future hero candidate.

17
00:00:32,998 --> 00:00:34,605
Mr. Kazuma, the tycoon.

18
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:35,900
Marry me.

19
00:00:36,307 --> 00:00:37,708
-Calm down.
-So cunning.

20
00:00:38,294 --> 00:00:40,197
-Because there's only one of me.
-I want to marry him, too!

21
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:45,586
Alright, alright.

22
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,199
Oh, my.

23
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,408
They're so anxious.

24
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:51,409
Calm down.

25
00:00:53,093 --> 00:00:55,403
Hey, don't do that here.

26
00:00:56,998 --> 00:00:58,394
Wait, you're really rude.

27
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:01,413
Hey, stop it!

28
00:01:01,414 --> 00:01:02,796
I am a conservative and reserved man

29
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,694
who prefers to take things slowly!

30
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:06,011
I got you.

31
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:13,015
I like…

32
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,002
I like…

33
00:01:15,905 --> 00:01:17,696
I quite like…

34
00:01:19,192 --> 00:01:21,592
I got you.

35
00:01:30,994 --> 00:01:32,400
(Episode 1: A Toast to a Bright Future)

36
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:33,601
Megumin, Megumin.

37
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:35,899
What is it?

38
00:01:36,502 --> 00:01:38,796
Did you see the souvenirs I bought
in the Crimson Demon Village?

39
00:01:40,493 --> 00:01:42,405
If you mean the bubble wine, it's empty.

40
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:43,511
So I put it away.

41
00:01:43,907 --> 00:01:45,207
That's strange.

42
00:01:45,693 --> 00:01:46,608
Hey, Kazuma.

43
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:49,208
You didn't drink my bubble wine, did you?

44
00:01:55,392 --> 00:01:56,897
Are you listening, Kazuma?

45
00:01:56,898 --> 00:01:58,293
My bubble wine…

46
00:01:58,294 --> 00:01:59,314
The wind…

47
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:00,006
What?

48
00:02:02,897 --> 00:02:03,998
The sun…

49
00:02:05,095 --> 00:02:06,412
What's wrong with him?

50
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:07,907
This is completely out
of character for him to do.

51
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:10,003
It is difficult not
to appreciate these things,

52
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,690
especially since Kazuma is
also a young man in the prime of his life.

53
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:15,107
I understand it very well.

54
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:18,500
Mr. Kazuma?

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,699
If you scream all of a sudden,
you might scare us.

56
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:23,405
Forget about the bubble wine.

57
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,999
What are you talking about?

58
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,399
(Konosuba)

59
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:33,311
You arrived so early.

60
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,214
We've received the reward
for saving the Crimson Demon Village.

61
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:41,702
Bring over some more bubble wine.

62
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,186
Hey, you're too impatient.
Useless Goddess.

63
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:45,871
You should pay for it first before…

64
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:47,802
Lady, another glass
of bubble wine, please!

65
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,699
Me too!

66
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,497
No, Megumin, you can't drink yet.

67
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:54,811
So cunning! I also want to drink
bubble wine.

68
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:57,897
No, you can't drink this.

69
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:00,793
You've been starting to drink at noon.

70
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:01,507
Let me join…

71
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:04,443
Don't stand behind me!

72
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:17,106
The wind…

73
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:20,687
(Konosuba)

74
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:23,196
I want to become a monk.

75
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:24,497
What?

76
00:03:24,899 --> 00:03:26,813
What's wrong with you?

77
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,312
You want to be a monk
and shave your head, right?

78
00:03:29,313 --> 00:03:30,496
It has nothing to do with shaving my head.

79
00:03:30,496 --> 00:03:31,902
Mr. Kazuma.

80
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:33,101
If you really want to become a monk,

81
00:03:33,102 --> 00:03:35,004
I think you should join the Axis Order.

82
00:03:35,005 --> 00:03:35,607
You're so annoying.

83
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:37,198
No matter what, that is the one place
I would never set foot in.

84
00:03:37,198 --> 00:03:39,101
Tell us the reason. What happened to you?

85
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,204
I once believed

86
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,704
spring will come.

87
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:56,395
Yunyun said she wanted to have my child.

88
00:03:57,097 --> 00:04:00,110
And I shared a bed
with that girl over there.

89
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:03,007
Those made me think
that I will be in love.

90
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:04,994
Yet, I'm still single now.

91
00:04:05,697 --> 00:04:06,902
Being attacked by orcs,
going through a crisis

92
00:04:06,902 --> 00:04:09,497
of the virginity, and suffering from
a mental disorder brought

93
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,203
by a love suicide with Chimera
are all I can say as my accomplishments.

94
00:04:19,196 --> 00:04:23,118
I misunderstood.

95
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:26,918
You must be tired.

96
00:04:27,907 --> 00:04:29,698
I'd like to say this to you.

97
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,411
The doctrine of the Axis Order.

98
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:32,405
You…

99
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:34,106
Stop it!

100
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:36,399
I ended up like this
by doing exactly as I was told.

101
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,995
I won't make the same mistake again.

102
00:04:37,996 --> 00:04:38,906
Hmph.

103
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:44,100
I want to become a monk,
instead of an adventurer.

104
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:45,004
Don't get in my way.

105
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:48,002
Is there a graduation
for those who are brave but reckless?

106
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:51,707
But this is good sometimes.

107
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:54,296
Especially for young people.

108
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:59,698
Because you possess endless possibilities.

109
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:03,802
Thank you.

110
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:09,402
Lady, introduce me to a temple, please.

111
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:11,913
What sect do you wish to join?

112
00:05:12,505 --> 00:05:14,797
I want to join a more strict sect.

113
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:16,695
Okay.

114
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:18,899
How about this one?

115
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,407
Although it's a bit far.

116
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,515
Thank you.

117
00:05:22,516 --> 00:05:24,207
Thank you for your help.

118
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:28,012
On top of that, I used to like you!

119
00:05:28,013 --> 00:05:29,999
Kazuma!

120
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,751
(Konosuba)

121
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:34,916
Wait a minute.

122
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,103
Kazuma, think about it again.

123
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:38,102
Yeah, think about it again.

124
00:05:38,103 --> 00:05:39,603
You should first take a nap…

125
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,506
Don't worry.

126
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:42,800
He will start

127
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,407
to miss the bubble wine
by the afternoon anyway.

128
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:47,298
Cut the chatter.

129
00:05:47,298 --> 00:05:48,743
Don't compare me with you,
Useless Goddess.

130
00:05:49,514 --> 00:05:51,199
You're calling me Useless Goddess again!

131
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,504
What's wrong with calling
you Useless Goddess…

132
00:05:52,505 --> 00:05:53,197
Goodbye.

133
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:57,605
Explosion!

134
00:06:00,797 --> 00:06:01,902
What's this?

135
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:10,200
My determination is more steadfast
than that rocky mountain.

136
00:06:10,892 --> 00:06:12,599
Pfft.

137
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,790
Kazuma, you are fragile,

138
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,405
so this does not make any sense at all.

139
00:06:16,405 --> 00:06:17,091
Hey, you!

140
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:18,798
Alright, clench your teeth.

141
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:21,209
I'll teach you a lesson right now
with my gender-equal punch.

142
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,594
Calm down, Kazuma.

143
00:06:22,595 --> 00:06:24,005
You have gone too far, Aqua.

144
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:24,614
Pfft.

145
00:06:24,614 --> 00:06:26,494
What are you doing? You're so childish.

146
00:06:26,495 --> 00:06:28,805
You should stay even
more calm in these situations.

147
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,105
What is with the grown-up act

148
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:31,410
when you are obviously just a little girl?

149
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:32,973
Your flat body

150
00:06:32,974 --> 00:06:35,111
never changes.

151
00:06:35,111 --> 00:06:36,607
You're making me mad.

152
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,507
If you rile a tiger,
it's going to show its claws.

153
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:40,690
Okay then.

154
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,598
Let me demolish
your insignificant determination.

155
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,401
It must be that mountain.

156
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,388
Explosion!

157
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:19,006
We have not camped
outside like this in a while.

158
00:07:19,696 --> 00:07:21,812
Are you kidding yourself?

159
00:07:21,813 --> 00:07:23,498
Tomorrow, you should leave on your own.

160
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,903
I was supposed to arrive today.

161
00:07:26,706 --> 00:07:27,696
I got you.

162
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:31,417
Kazuma, are you okay?

163
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:34,195
You have clairvoyance
and the ability to sense enemies,

164
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:36,389
so being awake is beneficial to us, but…

165
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:37,901
Don't worry about that.

166
00:07:38,498 --> 00:07:40,992
I often stay up late in my country, too.

167
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,112
So you're actually good
at staying up late.

168
00:07:44,793 --> 00:07:46,405
What was your life like before?

169
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:50,898
Well.

170
00:07:52,187 --> 00:07:54,112
Attacking fortresses with comrades

171
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,110
and hunting formidable Demon Lord.

172
00:07:57,306 --> 00:07:59,207
I did many strange things
when I was not sleeping.

173
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,199
Th-That's amazing.

174
00:08:01,707 --> 00:08:04,000
He doesn't seem to be lying.

175
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:05,902
Kazuma's current expression

176
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,503
does show both confidence and longing.

177
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,404
You're talking about
an online game, right?

178
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:12,901
(Konosuba)
Shh.

179
00:08:13,297 --> 00:08:14,402
A little roughness is acceptable

180
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:15,512
in the event of an emergency.

181
00:08:15,513 --> 00:08:16,294
Just wake me up.

182
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,695
Got it.

183
00:08:17,696 --> 00:08:19,073
I'll wake you up in a surprising way.

184
00:08:20,691 --> 00:08:21,916
I just remind you.

185
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,106
Don't cross the line with a friend.

186
00:08:24,503 --> 00:08:25,708
Men are creatures of challenge.

187
00:08:26,299 --> 00:08:28,498
the more you tell them
a wall is unclimbable,

188
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:30,607
the more they are compelled to try.

189
00:08:30,607 --> 00:08:33,040
Why do you say those things
with a carefree look?

190
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,809
Another glass of bubble wine, please!

191
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:47,500
Hey,

192
00:08:48,004 --> 00:08:50,602
why haven't you gone back to your country?

193
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,503
I am unable to return,
even though I wish to do so.

194
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:56,204
If your parents found out all of a sudden

195
00:08:56,205 --> 00:08:57,706
that you were going to become a monk…

196
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,306
That is maddening.

197
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:01,206
We are done with this topic.

198
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,114
Kazuma, it was you

199
00:09:02,795 --> 00:09:05,986
who let me keep going down
the path of Explosion Magic.

200
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:18,108
You have only seen the
120-point Explosion Magic, right?

201
00:09:19,514 --> 00:09:20,312
I will show you

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,502
the 200-point Explosion Magic one day.

203
00:09:28,705 --> 00:09:30,300
W-Well.

204
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,604
It is also not bad to live with everyone.

205
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:33,520
Probably.

206
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:36,612
Saving the Crimson Demon Village
also earns us a reward.

207
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:38,409
Y-You have a point.

208
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:40,199
I doubt that becoming

209
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,304
a monk would bring me inner peace.

210
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:44,396
Wait a minute.

211
00:09:44,397 --> 00:09:46,010
Vanir and I still need
to talk about business.

212
00:09:46,409 --> 00:09:47,633
We are surely able to make a lot of money.

213
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:49,880
A fun and relaxing life together

214
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,006
seems like a good idea.

215
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:56,199
I also like my current life a lot,

216
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,806
so I want to keep things the same.

217
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,904
No matter how many crises we encounter,

218
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,806
we always manage to find a way
to overcome them by working together.

219
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:10,507
What is the fun in living a life

220
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:11,617
full of crises all the time?

221
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,215
It…

222
00:10:18,398 --> 00:10:22,304
It would be great if we could
ever stay together like this.

223
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:25,463
Oh no!

224
00:10:25,464 --> 00:10:27,108
What is this touching scene?

225
00:10:28,007 --> 00:10:29,212
What should I do? what is she doing?

226
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,212
Why is she holding my hand
all of a sudden?

227
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,008
Will I be in love?

228
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,201
Is she seducing me?

229
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:36,204
In this case, would not it be better
to just say something nice?

230
00:10:36,205 --> 00:10:37,699
What could I possibly say?

231
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,805
Do not think too little of pure boy.

232
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,606
Calm down and take a deep breath first.

233
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:44,815
Okay.

234
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,499
Megumin,

235
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:49,463
I have changed my mind
about becoming a monk.

236
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,689
(Konosuba)
Gosh.

237
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:03,102
Near the end of this forest?

238
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,608
My second chapter is about to begin?

239
00:11:05,609 --> 00:11:07,901
-You will undoubtedly return in tears.
-I-I've been treated unfairly.

240
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,512
I will have a cold glass
of bubble wine ready for you.

241
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:11,601
Shut up!

242
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:13,642
Megumin, what's the matter?

243
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:15,715
What exactly happened to you?

244
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,114
It seems like someone is there.

245
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,303
She's hurt.

246
00:11:32,304 --> 00:11:33,599
Are you okay?

247
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:37,405
That is a mimic monster.

248
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:38,699
Huh?

249
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:42,197
My enemy detection skill
sends out an alarm.

250
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:48,996
Hey, Kazuma.

251
00:11:48,997 --> 00:11:50,210
-What's wrong?
-I don't know why

252
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,900
I have a strong desire to help her heal.

253
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:56,811
Easygoing girl, a plant-type monster.

254
00:11:57,405 --> 00:12:01,086
It is a scary monster
that makes people who pass by

255
00:12:01,086 --> 00:12:02,397
have a strong desire to protect it.

256
00:12:03,909 --> 00:12:04,819
Hey, Kazuma.

257
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,320
-What's wrong?
-I don't know why

258
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:07,895
she looked at me so sadly.

259
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:09,813
As long as you stay with her,

260
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:12,207
she will smile in a way
that makes you feel

261
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,100
so good that you cannot leave her.

262
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:17,904
It is more likely that this monster
will capture travelers who are kind.

263
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:19,311
Be more careful.

264
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:21,298
-Ka-Kazuma.
-It hurts.

265
00:12:21,298 --> 00:12:24,104
-She is really trying hard not to cry out loud.
-What's wrong?

266
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:26,198
Can I hold her for a bit?

267
00:12:26,493 --> 00:12:28,413
Are you all listening to me?

268
00:12:29,194 --> 00:12:32,107
The guild has designated her
as a priority expulsion monster.

269
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:35,222
I will heal you right now.

270
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:37,520
It is already fine.

271
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,398
Strange, this isn't a bandage.

272
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,603
But it looks like bandage mimicry.

273
00:12:59,498 --> 00:13:01,793
According to the book, she arouses
the travelers' protective desire

274
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:02,794
to ensnare them,

275
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:04,390
causing them to starve to death
and taking root in their bodies.

276
00:13:06,013 --> 00:13:07,799
Wait. What are you going to do, Kazuma?

277
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,004
I won't let you do that.

278
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:11,008
I don't want to do this either.

279
00:13:11,008 --> 00:13:12,289
I have no choice.

280
00:13:13,408 --> 00:13:15,707
Are you going to kill me?

281
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:17,208
She can talk?

282
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,891
Are you even looking at me in this way?

283
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:21,812
Rest assured.

284
00:13:21,813 --> 00:13:22,904
I am going to make this man shut up

285
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:24,908
with the holy iron fist.

286
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:27,917
Are you going to kill me?

287
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,906
Are you going to kill me?

288
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:37,213
Get yourself together.
She is going to kill people.

289
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:39,608
Are you going to kill me?

290
00:13:39,997 --> 00:13:42,804
It is bad to leave her alone?

291
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:44,903
Or it is bad to to get rid of her?

292
00:13:44,903 --> 00:13:45,813
Kazuma.

293
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,812
You will regret it

294
00:13:52,509 --> 00:13:54,914
when making a choice amidst confusion.

295
00:13:54,915 --> 00:13:55,813
That being the case,

296
00:13:55,814 --> 00:13:58,006
pick the easier side now.

297
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,903
This is such a careless idea.

298
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,214
Is not this how a useless person thinks?

299
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,425
I'm sorry.
It's all because I exist in this world.

300
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:12,609
Because I am a monster.

301
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,508
So…

302
00:14:14,195 --> 00:14:17,912
As long as I live,
I will make trouble for others.

303
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:28,202
This is the first time
I have ever talked to a human.

304
00:14:28,597 --> 00:14:32,207
What a great thing that you can be

305
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:34,803
the first and last person I see.

306
00:14:35,311 --> 00:14:38,698
I hope that if I had
a second chance at life,

307
00:14:39,394 --> 00:14:44,618
I would not be a monster.

308
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:49,898
It was so hard for me to do it.

309
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,809
Damn it.

310
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,703
It feels bad

311
00:14:54,704 --> 00:14:55,806
whether I spare that monster

312
00:14:55,807 --> 00:14:57,191
or kill it.

313
00:14:57,503 --> 00:15:00,109
It looks like you still
have your humanity.

314
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:01,706
Of course.

315
00:15:02,707 --> 00:15:03,704
She said

316
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:06,611
this was her first time
she's talking to a person.

317
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,808
So it is likely that she has
not killed anyone yet.

318
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:11,404
Strange.

319
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:12,800
Wait a minute.

320
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:14,089
What's wrong?

321
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,902
Do you have a stomachache?

322
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:17,537
I had tissue with me.

323
00:15:17,537 --> 00:15:18,790
No, it's not that.

324
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,600
I suddenly thought of something.

325
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:23,587
I'll be right back.

326
00:15:24,212 --> 00:15:25,706
Pfft.

327
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:26,907
He gets embarrassed very easily.

328
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:28,799
(Konosuba)
Shut up!

329
00:15:31,488 --> 00:15:33,308
This is the path to the temple.

330
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,187
I'll go tell her

331
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:37,197
not to wave at passersby
under any circumstances.

332
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:38,887
That's right.

333
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,312
If I can get her to agree,

334
00:15:40,313 --> 00:15:41,466
I will send her food

335
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:43,893
from the temple every day.

336
00:15:44,507 --> 00:15:45,507
Right, right.

337
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:48,905
My decision to become a monk
may be destined.

338
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:51,605
Yes, it must be so.

339
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:56,304
Hey.

340
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:09,400
Those guys just now have good physiques.

341
00:16:09,401 --> 00:16:11,594
They seem like
they could be good nourishment.

342
00:16:13,408 --> 00:16:16,198
But it still feels
like something is missing.

343
00:16:18,201 --> 00:16:20,400
Are you going to kill me?

344
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:25,105
Are you going to kill me?

345
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:26,996
If…

346
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,311
I hope that if I had
a second chance at life…

347
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,895
Humans…

348
00:16:31,895 --> 00:16:33,206
Family…

349
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:34,401
Friends…

350
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:36,298
Friends!

351
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,401
This is good.

352
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:39,808
There is no doubt
that it will move people.

353
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,509
I hope that if I had
a second chance at life…

354
00:16:42,509 --> 00:16:43,804
I hope

355
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:47,905
we can be friends.

356
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:49,708
Hilarious.

357
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,109
This is just perfect.

358
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,201
The nutrients in this guy are almost gone.

359
00:16:57,202 --> 00:16:58,604
When foods show up again,

360
00:16:58,605 --> 00:16:59,898
I will use this strong statement

361
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:01,261
to kill them right away.

362
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,106
Great! The sky is very clear.

363
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,802
Let's do photosynthesis.

364
00:17:14,704 --> 00:17:16,594
Friends…

365
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:19,207
Disregard what I just said.

366
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,799
Do not you remember
how well you spoke just now?

367
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,499
Idiot.

368
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,013
(Konosuba)
Friends!

369
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:28,599
(Konosuba)
Friends!

370
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:29,797
Let's go back.

371
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:30,696
What?

372
00:17:30,697 --> 00:17:32,193
All of a sudden, I can see
many things through.

373
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:33,314
Let's go back to Axel.

374
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:34,709
Really? Kazuma.

375
00:17:34,709 --> 00:17:35,206
Yeah.

376
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:36,803
You look like you're having a good time.

377
00:17:36,803 --> 00:17:37,103
Yeah.

378
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:38,304
You must have been pooping a lot, right?

379
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:38,800
Yeah.

380
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:40,400
Is there no need for toilet paper?

381
00:17:40,401 --> 00:17:40,702
Yeah.

382
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:41,099
Huh?

383
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,700
I told you that it was not that.

384
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,218
Strange.

385
00:17:45,303 --> 00:17:46,902
Where did this hammer come from?

386
00:17:48,395 --> 00:17:50,997
After discovering a dead body,
I went to bury him

387
00:17:50,998 --> 00:17:52,027
and discovered this hammer.

388
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:56,600
I feel like I've seen this somewhere.

389
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:58,325
Let me take a look.

390
00:17:58,705 --> 00:17:59,899
Hey, stop it.

391
00:17:59,899 --> 00:18:01,098
-Don't treat it roughly.
-Just for a second.

392
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,706
-This thing might be valuable.
-Just for a second.

393
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:18,403
(Konosuba)
Let's go back.

394
00:18:24,698 --> 00:18:26,417
I got you.

395
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,100
Got you.

396
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:31,210
Got you.

397
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:32,800
I got you!

398
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:33,906
Hey, you there!

399
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:35,708
Mr. Kazuma.

400
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:39,307
I have been dying to try a certain brand
of high-end bubble wine.

401
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:41,559
I'll buy it for you.

402
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:44,313
Oh, as long as one has money,

403
00:18:44,313 --> 00:18:46,607
the mental state will be different.

404
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:47,807
Hey!

405
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,918
Chris.

406
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,305
Hey.

407
00:18:51,305 --> 00:18:53,202
It seems like today is
a very pleasant day for you all.

408
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:56,007
We are now going to
celebrate Kazuma's comeback.

409
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:57,694
-Comeback?
-Do you want to join us?

410
00:18:57,695 --> 00:18:58,893
Come join us.

411
00:18:58,894 --> 00:19:00,200
Don't worry about money.

412
00:19:00,595 --> 00:19:03,214
Sorry, I happen to have plans today.

413
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:04,675
Let's make it another time.

414
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,904
Okay, no problem.

415
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,309
Goodbye.

416
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:11,706
Kazuma, Kazuma.

417
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:14,192
I also want to have a robe.

418
00:19:14,192 --> 00:19:16,027
I'll buy it for you.

419
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:17,904
I'll use the Wish Granting
Hammer right now…

420
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:28,504
(Konosuba)
My hammer!

421
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:31,594
I am never going to
leave this house again.

422
00:19:31,595 --> 00:19:33,598
It's wrong for a homebody like me

423
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,106
to try to do something.

424
00:19:36,103 --> 00:19:37,822
It is too bad about the hammer,

425
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:40,105
but it is great that you could
return to your original self.

426
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,013
I can't stand you.

427
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,419
You started to slack off all at once.

428
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:47,510
But for some reason,
it's truly reassuring.

429
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:51,690
I feel like I do not have
to try so hard anymore either.

430
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,409
Aqua, you can't slack off either.

431
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,199
Excuse me.

432
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,504
Is anyone there?

433
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,702
Excuse me.

434
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,719
Is anyone…

435
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:06,744
Take this!

436
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:08,508
What's going on?

437
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:09,904
S-Stop it!

438
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,606
I am not sure who you are,

439
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:12,649
but you must be causing
some sort of trouble.

440
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,407
Go back, you god of plague.

441
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:15,902
Kazuma, use Drain Touch.

442
00:20:15,903 --> 00:20:17,990
Use Drain Touch
to steal his consciousness.

443
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,501
Throw him out. Pretend no one's here.

444
00:20:20,502 --> 00:20:21,802
Idiot.

445
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,503
(Konosuba)

446
00:20:25,588 --> 00:20:27,200
Isn't this Hagen?

447
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:28,600
How come you are here?

448
00:20:28,601 --> 00:20:29,809
This is bad.

449
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:32,401
If this goes on, young lady,
your only advantage will…

450
00:20:32,784 --> 00:20:34,600
Hey, you haven't deflated, have you?

451
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,804
Has her vile body deflated?

452
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:38,231
What are you talking about?

453
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:39,404
No, it's not.

454
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,195
If this keeps up, our family
will lose its noble status,

455
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:43,996
and the young lady's only advantage,

456
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:45,704
her family status, will also disappear.

457
00:20:45,705 --> 00:20:47,496
What are you talking about?

458
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,415
Isn't…

459
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:52,686
Isn't this the royal family's crest?

460
00:20:59,098 --> 00:20:59,807
What's wrong?

461
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:01,697
No, it's nothing.

462
00:21:01,698 --> 00:21:03,796
You have nothing to do with it.

463
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:04,595
So don't worry about it.

464
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:05,811
Let me see.

465
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:07,809
I refuse.

466
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:09,399
Didn't you just say it?

467
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,206
You didn't want to get involved
in trouble.

468
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:11,804
So…

469
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:12,892
Steal.

470
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:15,499
Let go.

471
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:17,257
Stop.

472
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:21,497
Dear great adventurer who vanquished
leaders of Devil King's Army,

473
00:21:21,498 --> 00:21:22,910
Kazuma Sato,

474
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:27,803
I would greatly appreciate
the opportunity to dine with you

475
00:21:28,201 --> 00:21:30,203
and hear your heroic feats.

476
00:21:31,393 --> 00:21:34,701
The First Princess, Eris?

477
00:21:41,202 --> 00:21:42,709
Kazuma, you should decline.

478
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:44,610
If something goes wrong,
there will be disasters.

479
00:21:44,611 --> 00:21:46,324
Besides, you don't know
manners either, do you?

480
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:47,986
That's right.

481
00:21:47,987 --> 00:21:48,796
If we are going to eat,

482
00:21:48,797 --> 00:21:51,503
let us just book a good restaurant…

483
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:54,103
Our time has finally come.

484
00:21:56,307 --> 00:21:57,402
Kill me.

485
00:21:57,814 --> 00:21:59,305
Kill me, please.

486
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:02,419
Kill me!

487
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:20,494
(Konosuba Season 3)

488
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:33,990
(Episode 2: A Smile
for the Unsmiling Girl)

489
00:23:33,991 --> 00:23:36,302
How have you been, Devil King?

490
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:39,207
A pleasure to meet you.
I am Dullahan Beldia.

491
00:23:39,997 --> 00:23:42,466
You've taken care of me in my life.
