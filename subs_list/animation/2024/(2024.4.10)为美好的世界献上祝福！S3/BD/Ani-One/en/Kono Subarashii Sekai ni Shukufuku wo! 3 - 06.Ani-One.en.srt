1
00:00:02,105 --> 00:00:03,808
What the heck!

2
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:08,704
How come the sacred treasure
lost its power so quickly?

3
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:13,499
Princess Iris.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,979
Now is not the time to change back!

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,802
(Episode 6: Farewell to the Good Life)
Hey, Kazuma.

6
00:00:18,803 --> 00:00:21,406
-Yes. I'm Kazuma.
-You treat me like an idiot all the time.

7
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:22,803
I can finally say it out now.

8
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:26,406
You are a super-duper idiot, aren't you?

9
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:27,994
I'm not!

10
00:00:27,995 --> 00:00:28,959
I subconsciously believe

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,609
that I am someone
who will be forgiven for anything

12
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,697
because so many people bow

13
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,703
and nod to me when I walk in the castle.

14
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:36,406
You really are an idiot, aren't you?

15
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:37,897
Give it some more serious thought!

16
00:00:37,898 --> 00:00:40,705
I didn't expect even Iris
to be this angry.

17
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:43,911
This is killing me.

18
00:00:43,912 --> 00:00:45,999
Is all he does just talk the talk?

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,010
Geez.

20
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:48,193
Why would Lady Dustiness

21
00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:50,411
team up with someone like that?

22
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:51,895
Exactly.

23
00:00:51,896 --> 00:00:54,401
Princess Iris has already
gone back to her room.

24
00:00:54,796 --> 00:00:56,499
I-I see.

25
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,395
Now it's finally time to say goodbye.

26
00:00:58,396 --> 00:01:01,016
Enjoy the victory feast today.

27
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:04,402
That is, if you have
the courage to enjoy it.

28
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:07,667
Konosuba.

29
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:09,906
Damn it.

30
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:11,499
What's with that woman?

31
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,505
She kept being sarcastic
all the way through.

32
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,906
Of course, I was at fault too.

33
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:17,505
It's more accurate
to say it was all my fault.

34
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:21,506
But I really want to stay
in the castle longer!

35
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:31,308
My answer will always be the same,
no matter how many times you come.

36
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:34,308
Alright, alright, don't say that.

37
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,906
Let me tell you.

38
00:01:36,907 --> 00:01:39,994
The castle contains a sacred treasure
with the ability to swap bodies.

39
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:42,610
I don't think that is dangerous, though.

40
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:45,197
You can't go back

41
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:46,994
to the original state

42
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:48,401
if the other one dies

43
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:50,194
during the body swap, you know?

44
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:51,204
What?

45
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,111
Depending on how it is used,

46
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:56,808
that thing has the power
to give eternal life.

47
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:58,992
If your body gets old,

48
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,708
just swap it with someone young
and healthy and kill them.

49
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,997
And that is it.

50
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,796
This is a big problem.

51
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:07,307
Those influential people
need to know this immediately…

52
00:02:07,308 --> 00:02:09,203
I think it would be wiser if you didn't.

53
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:11,401
Do you know what those
who discover the sacred treasure's power

54
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:13,407
would do with it?

55
00:02:15,414 --> 00:02:16,510
Nobles from all over the country

56
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,844
will surely come to steal
the sacred treasure, I dare say it.

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,204
Because of eternal life?

58
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:28,203
I am only disclosing this to you

59
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:31,235
because I have faith
that you will not abuse it.

60
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:32,505
Huh?

61
00:02:32,506 --> 00:02:35,296
What makes her trust me so much?

62
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:36,297
Hey.

63
00:02:36,298 --> 00:02:39,594
Were you not tasked with accompanying
the princess on her playdate?

64
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:44,104
Would you like to play
with the princess now?

65
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:46,206
What?

66
00:02:50,589 --> 00:02:51,620
Very good, very good.

67
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:53,895
This victory feast is rocking!

68
00:02:53,896 --> 00:02:55,250
So the guard is very lax.

69
00:02:55,803 --> 00:02:56,813
Indeed.

70
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,302
Hey.

71
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,391
What is that get-up of yours?

72
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,496
Isn't it unfair that only you are
hiding who you are?

73
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,808
I obtained it from a suspicious clerk

74
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,395
at a specific magical item store.

75
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,522
I heard it's a best-selling product.

76
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:12,803
So, errand boy,

77
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:15,109
are you ready?

78
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:17,208
I am always ready.

79
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,209
Boss.

80
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,391
Please, don't call me boss.

81
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:25,604
Then do not call me errand boy.

82
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:27,802
In the name of a chivalrous thief,

83
00:03:27,803 --> 00:03:30,105
I am the one making a big name
in this royal capital.

84
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:35,093
How about we play a game
of rock-paper-scissors to decide?

85
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:37,391
Alright, let's play rock-paper-scissors.

86
00:03:38,013 --> 00:03:39,093
(Konosuba)
Ready?

87
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,698
Rock, paper…

88
00:03:42,094 --> 00:03:43,203
Assistant.

89
00:03:43,204 --> 00:03:45,203
The princess is right here, correct?

90
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:46,809
Yes, chief.

91
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,494
I lost at rock-paper-scissors
for the first time in my life.

92
00:03:50,495 --> 00:03:52,385
Despite being very skilled,

93
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:53,730
I am facing such a height…

94
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:56,401
Snipe.

95
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:05,604
Having an assistant is really handy.

96
00:04:14,597 --> 00:04:16,578
So far, everything has gone smoothly.

97
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,589
Shh.

98
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:23,005
Chief, I've sensed the enemy.

99
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:30,894
Hey, Assistant.

100
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,697
We have used the lurk.

101
00:04:32,698 --> 00:04:34,606
You don't need to stand so close.

102
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,593
We mustn't be careless, Chief.

103
00:04:36,594 --> 00:04:37,598
Get closer a bit.

104
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:39,192
Come on, hurry up!

105
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:40,797
Hey, too close!

106
00:04:40,798 --> 00:04:43,098
This is to protect world peace.

107
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:44,047
You have to endure it.

108
00:04:44,048 --> 00:04:45,408
Please endure it.

109
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:45,912
Hey!

110
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:48,818
You will be punished by
the Goddess Eris when the time comes.

111
00:04:48,819 --> 00:04:49,889
It's thieves!

112
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,202
Thieves have appeared!

113
00:04:51,203 --> 00:04:53,208
Alert! Alert!

114
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:00,965
It is all because
you yelled out of the blue!

115
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:03,306
I need to talk to you later!

116
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:05,962
It is not the time to argue.

117
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:07,603
You're not qualified to say that.

118
00:05:07,604 --> 00:05:08,594
Don't let them get up there!

119
00:05:08,595 --> 00:05:10,609
Princess Iris is on the top floor.

120
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,605
Create Water.

121
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:16,317
Freeze.

122
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:23,411
Stop right there!

123
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:25,399
Having an assistant is very convenient.

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,301
Don't just talk the talk.

125
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:28,103
Chief, you should help out too.

126
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:29,104
Okay.

127
00:05:29,105 --> 00:05:31,698
I'll let you witness the chief's power.

128
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:35,307
Wire Trap!

129
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,297
You should use this move sooner.

130
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,707
All right, this will buy us some time.

131
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:45,094
I didn't realize you'd cut yourselves off.

132
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:48,805
Damned thief.

133
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,911
You won't be able to escape now.

134
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,905
This is not good.

135
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,311
That's it!

136
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,097
Let us get away from that.

137
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:58,410
No, wait a minute.

138
00:05:59,597 --> 00:06:02,306
It should be settled today.

139
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:04,998
Because tomorrow I have
to leave the royal capital.

140
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:08,713
Do you normally work this hard?

141
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:11,703
Right.

142
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,706
Am I such a passionate character?

143
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,603
Calm down.

144
00:06:15,604 --> 00:06:17,801
I should be a colder man.

145
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:18,708
Correct.

146
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:20,092
Once I get back to Axel,

147
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:21,650
I can have fun every day.

148
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,666
That's the situation here.

149
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,817
I really can't focus on my studies.

150
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:30,708
I want you to play this game
with me today.

151
00:06:31,098 --> 00:06:33,598
I have never met anyone like you before.

152
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,988
Everyone loves and cherishes you,

153
00:06:35,989 --> 00:06:37,312
and you are brave,

154
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,422
rude, and outspoken.

155
00:06:39,423 --> 00:06:40,316
Hey!

156
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:43,536
I'm not asking what you dislike about me,

157
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:47,097
Yeah, I'm telling you
the reasons I like you.

158
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:55,213
Chief, I…

159
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,701
Okay, now it is time for me
to impress you.

160
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:00,201
Assistant?

161
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,890
Cut the chatter.

162
00:07:04,994 --> 00:07:05,911
What?

163
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,305
What skill is that, Assistant?

164
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:22,613
That's exactly why I kept it a secret.

165
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:25,401
Great, this is so great!

166
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:28,024
For some reason, I'm in great condition!

167
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,409
My magic has gotten stronger,
and my blood flow has gotten better.

168
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,498
My skin also looks great.

169
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:36,497
Tonight I will show you
what I am really capable of.

170
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,488
The Silver-Haired Thieves are coming!

171
00:07:43,383 --> 00:07:46,295
Move out of the way

172
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,306
if you do not want to suffer!

173
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:54,702
This guy is very strong.

174
00:07:55,607 --> 00:07:57,295
Despite wearing a strange mask.

175
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:02,394
Lightning.

176
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:03,816
Skill Bind.

177
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:06,098
What?

178
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:08,903
The Silver-Haired Thieves sound terrible.

179
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:10,618
You should just be the chief

180
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:12,706
and change it to something
like the Masked Thieves.

181
00:08:12,707 --> 00:08:13,909
I refuse.

182
00:08:14,597 --> 00:08:16,107
That makes me sound like the mastermind.

183
00:08:16,108 --> 00:08:17,509
Who would like that?

184
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:19,707
I don't like it either.

185
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:27,591
Miss Claire…

186
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:30,186
It seems like you've encountered
formidable enemies.

187
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,900
I, Swordsmanship Master,

188
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,396
will catch that man in the mask.

189
00:08:47,092 --> 00:08:48,092
Miss Claire…

190
00:08:48,504 --> 00:08:51,400
This young man with silver hair
is yours to handle.

191
00:08:54,404 --> 00:08:55,696
Hey, Assistant.

192
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,900
Do I really look that much like a boy?

193
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:01,696
It must be due to your flat chest.

194
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:05,091
Pull yourself together.

195
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:07,097
What follows is the important part.

196
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:08,987
I am going to take his Cursed Sword.

197
00:09:08,988 --> 00:09:11,711
That action looks like Steal.

198
00:09:11,712 --> 00:09:12,905
Sadly,

199
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:15,386
after losing to a certain person,

200
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,722
I thought of a way to beat Steal.

201
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,791
Steal,

202
00:09:19,501 --> 00:09:20,400
It's no use.

203
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:22,603
Wha--

204
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,895
That's just a distraction.

205
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:24,895
Freeze.

206
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:25,801
Then…

207
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:26,899
Freeze.

208
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:34,198
What?

209
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,603
Create Water.

210
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:42,098
Mr. Mitsurugi!

211
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:46,805
Who would go up against
a Swordsmanship Master face-to-face?

212
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:48,400
We must not underestimate the enemy.

213
00:09:51,498 --> 00:09:53,498
Is this ill will?

214
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:54,999
Delicious.

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,409
This is so delicious.

216
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,602
You jerk!

217
00:09:57,603 --> 00:09:58,603
Dodge.

218
00:10:01,104 --> 00:10:03,206
You should take care
of that man right away.

219
00:10:03,207 --> 00:10:04,649
Mr. Mitsurugi!

220
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,603
Rain.

221
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,106
Quickly use magic to heal.

222
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,397
I-I will use it right away.

223
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:09,493
Hurry, Chief.

224
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,998
Don't let them escape.

225
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,711
Princess Iris is just up ahead.

226
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,394
Come quickly! Someone come!

227
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:22,488
Ahead is Iris's room.

228
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:23,707
Understood, Assistant.

229
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,290
Great, this is so great!

230
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:28,655
This is just so great!

231
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:32,098
This is it, intruder.

232
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:34,925
It is my duty to defend the people,

233
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,890
the country,

234
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,321
and the royal family…

235
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:43,097
What do we do, Assistant?

236
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:44,701
Hey, jerk! Don't close the door!

237
00:10:44,702 --> 00:10:47,108
What on earth are you up to?

238
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:52,395
Intruder.

239
00:10:52,999 --> 00:10:55,306
Impressive that you've made it here.

240
00:10:56,102 --> 00:10:58,198
I am a royal who descended from heroes

241
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:01,493
and has the power
to strengthen my position.

242
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:05,003
I stake this heirloom royal ring…

243
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:06,305
Get out of the way.

244
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:09,001
Leave these petty thieves to me…

245
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,998
S-So cool.

246
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,899
What to do, Darkness?

247
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,899
This chivalrous thief has excellent taste.

248
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,201
He is even wearing a cool mask

249
00:11:19,202 --> 00:11:21,310
and dressed entirely in black.

250
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:22,207
What is your team's name?

251
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,806
Is the name decided?

252
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,499
Bind.

253
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:29,394
So cool.

254
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:31,397
Great.

255
00:11:31,398 --> 00:11:34,603
Sacred Break Spell.

256
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:42,904
I am sorry

257
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:46,004
that running into me here
means you have lost your luck.

258
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,805
I have no idea why you came here,

259
00:11:48,806 --> 00:11:50,815
but I will get

260
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:54,713
the expensive bubble wine again
if I catch you.

261
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,904
Alright, surrender now.

262
00:11:57,905 --> 00:11:59,801
This guy…

263
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:01,993
Darkness, now is the time!

264
00:12:01,994 --> 00:12:04,301
Why Megumin has lost all her cool?

265
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:05,993
We can only rely on you now.

266
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:07,098
Okay.

267
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,697
Chief.

268
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:10,795
We'll try to get through and use Steal.

269
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,607
You plan to steal
the sacred treasure, don't you?

270
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:14,301
But your Steal…

271
00:12:14,302 --> 00:12:16,306
Are you going to say
it'll steal underwear?

272
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:17,087
Yeah.

273
00:12:17,088 --> 00:12:18,694
Princess Iris!

274
00:12:18,695 --> 00:12:19,821
Despicable fellow!

275
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,301
How dare you use such means?

276
00:12:21,812 --> 00:12:22,907
Lord Dustiness!

277
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,910
Let's attack them from both sides!

278
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,091
I am going to give it

279
00:12:28,092 --> 00:12:30,216
-Chief.
-my all!

280
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:33,212
H-Horizontal slash!

281
00:12:34,707 --> 00:12:36,812
That's why you're a useless cross knight.

282
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:40,207
Princess Iris!

283
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,108
Now is the time!

284
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:45,806
Steal.

285
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:51,352
Good job, Assistant.

286
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,801
We're going to jump down from here.

287
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:54,789
My necklace!

288
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,108
Even though I do not know what it is,

289
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,097
I can't let you take it away.

290
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:02,805
Up until the very end, that guy…

291
00:13:02,806 --> 00:13:04,300
Seal.

292
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:09,009
All jerks!

293
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:15,294
S-So cool.

294
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:25,509
Calm down, calm down.

295
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,373
It's splitting, it's splitting!

296
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,591
My head is splitting!

297
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:31,409
I'm just being instigated.

298
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,196
The mastermind is Chris!

299
00:13:33,706 --> 00:13:35,201
You! Damn you!

300
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:36,689
That hurts.

301
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,310
You said the reason for making a fuss

302
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,603
is to get back
a dangerous sacred treasure?

303
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,510
Why did not you tell me from the start?

304
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:47,409
It must have been very hard for you

305
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,800
if you found out that
he and I were working together.

306
00:13:49,801 --> 00:13:51,495
That hurts!

307
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:54,405
Hey, you are not supposed to talk, okay?

308
00:13:56,209 --> 00:13:57,585
Geez.

309
00:13:58,201 --> 00:14:00,297
Is there anything else you're hiding?

310
00:14:02,705 --> 00:14:04,504
It seems there is.

311
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:08,894
What's this?

312
00:14:09,702 --> 00:14:12,809
Because working together
increases the chances of success.

313
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:14,456
Why do your Steal

314
00:14:14,457 --> 00:14:16,409
keep stealing things that you shouldn't?

315
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,397
It's not underwear this time.

316
00:14:18,398 --> 00:14:20,306
That's not the issue here.

317
00:14:23,707 --> 00:14:24,905
Listen carefully, Kazuma.

318
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:28,201
You must never lose this ring.

319
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:31,098
And don't let anyone find out about it.

320
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:32,493
Take it with you to the grave.

321
00:14:32,494 --> 00:14:34,003
Hey, don't be like that.

322
00:14:34,004 --> 00:14:35,206
As this is a very important item,

323
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,197
I will simply say that I found it nearby

324
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:37,832
and am now going to return it.

325
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:38,383
Idiot!

326
00:14:38,384 --> 00:14:39,103
That hurts!

327
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,805
It is something that should be
given to a future spouse

328
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:44,785
and can only be taken off
when an engagement is confirmed.

329
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:48,300
But to think that it was stolen by thieves

330
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:50,806
and found by adventurers nearby?

331
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,795
They would probably
kill you to silence you

332
00:14:53,796 --> 00:14:56,093
even if you returned it.

333
00:14:56,603 --> 00:14:57,998
What does that mean? That's terrifying.

334
00:14:57,999 --> 00:15:00,493
Princess Iris has always
worn this ring on her hand,

335
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:02,004
and she really cares about it.

336
00:15:02,603 --> 00:15:03,901
Whatever happens,

337
00:15:03,902 --> 00:15:05,493
you have to keep it with you at all times

338
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:07,301
and not let anyone see it.

339
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:20,520
I had no idea that necklace
was so dangerous.

340
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:24,045
Good job, Lord Dustiness.

341
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,405
Thank you.

342
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:27,916
Speaking of which,

343
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:28,207
you were of no use that night either.

344
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:34,592
Could they

345
00:15:35,204 --> 00:15:38,301
have been trying to help me?

346
00:15:39,098 --> 00:15:40,206
If so,

347
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:41,409
the thief who is said to be out there

348
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,607
would really be a chivalrous thief.

349
00:15:44,608 --> 00:15:46,013
How can that be possible?

350
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:49,190
But if that is true,

351
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:51,699
I have to say they are pretty cool.

352
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,801
Huh?

353
00:15:54,697 --> 00:15:56,493
Are you talking about
the person wearing the mask?

354
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:58,310
He's really cool, isn't he?

355
00:15:58,311 --> 00:16:00,493
I was drawn to that mask

356
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:02,498
and the black clothes.

357
00:16:02,499 --> 00:16:03,410
If I see him again,

358
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:05,213
I will definitely beg for an autograph.

359
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,914
Oh no, what should I do?

360
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:10,510
I wish I could brag
to everyone that that is me.

361
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,196
What's wrong, Kazuma?

362
00:16:13,197 --> 00:16:15,593
You've been giggling all the time.
It's kind of disgusting, you know.

363
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:19,410
What exactly are you laughing about?

364
00:16:21,493 --> 00:16:25,410
The chivalrous thief

365
00:16:26,097 --> 00:16:27,702
looks really handsome.

366
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,904
Given the circumstances,

367
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:33,416
she surely could not have guessed
who the thief was, could she?

368
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:38,206
Their actions suggest

369
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,503
that they are concerned about me.

370
00:16:41,098 --> 00:16:49,197
I might have fallen for
that chivalrous thief.

371
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,394
Okay.

372
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:52,805
I'll reveal my identity then.

373
00:16:52,806 --> 00:16:54,394
W-What's the matter, Kazuma?

374
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:55,909
-Why did you suddenly stand up?
-What are you doing?

375
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,493
Do you need to pee? Do you need to pee?

376
00:16:57,494 --> 00:16:58,909
-You're such a pain.
-Do you want to see me pee?

377
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:00,100
-I am very sorry.
-Okay.

378
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,696
-I'll get this rude guy out of here right away.
-I'll just pee right here for you to see.

379
00:17:02,697 --> 00:17:04,947
Hey, quickly let go.

380
00:17:04,948 --> 00:17:06,591
Otherwise, I'll use Drain Touch.

381
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:07,597
That chief

382
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:11,195
with the silver hair has me wondering

383
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:16,216
about him and his whereabouts.

384
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:24,405
Konosuba.

385
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,212
It makes me a little sad to leave.

386
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:32,909
Older brother.

387
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:35,207
I have a wish.

388
00:17:37,209 --> 00:17:38,815
I have something to say

389
00:17:38,816 --> 00:17:40,092
before you bring up that wish.

390
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:47,315
This person has defeated
many Leaders of the Devil King's Army.

391
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,904
Eventually,

392
00:17:48,905 --> 00:17:51,306
he might beat the Devil King.

393
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:53,602
Even though it is hard to do

394
00:17:53,603 --> 00:17:54,994
and not very likely to happen.

395
00:17:56,001 --> 00:17:59,206
Could you kindly offer some words
of encouragement to him,

396
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,707
who is courageous enough
to face the challenges head-on?

397
00:18:02,303 --> 00:18:04,894
What is she talking about now?

398
00:18:05,703 --> 00:18:07,211
Defeat the Devil King?

399
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,211
Really?

400
00:18:09,212 --> 00:18:12,590
Are you really going
to defeat the Devil King?

401
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:15,806
How could that possi--

402
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:23,701
Well. If there is a chance,
it appears like a good idea to go

403
00:18:23,702 --> 00:18:28,306
and subdue the Devil King.

404
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:33,112
Older brother, you can surely do it!

405
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,410
Please do your best
to repel the Devil King!

406
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:38,399
You keep calling him "older brother."

407
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,519
Stop calling him that.

408
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,602
You have your own real brother, right?

409
00:18:43,603 --> 00:18:46,107
Why don't you go and flirt with him?

410
00:18:46,108 --> 00:18:49,084
One day, I will personally
put an end to the Devil King.

411
00:18:49,085 --> 00:18:50,795
Kazuma doesn't need to action.

412
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,196
He is older brother.

413
00:18:53,197 --> 00:18:54,826
What is wrong with calling him

414
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,571
"older brother"?

415
00:18:56,572 --> 00:19:00,513
Besides, there's no point in
you defeating the Devil King.

416
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,591
I hope that older brother
will defeat the Devil King.

417
00:19:03,592 --> 00:19:05,059
I just told you not to call him that!

418
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,602
And yet you keep calling him
"older brother"!

419
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,896
Are you challenging me?

420
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,189
D-Do you want to fight?

421
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,483
The royal family is very strong, you know.

422
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:13,984
-Hey, stop it, Megumin!
-What are you talking about?

423
00:19:13,985 --> 00:19:15,543
-Clearly, you and Princess Iris
-Even the royal family would not be

424
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:17,315
-became closer yesterday.
-able to stop my explosion magic!

425
00:19:17,316 --> 00:19:21,085
- Princess Iris, please calm down.
-Fine, experience it for yourself then.

426
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:23,628
-You clearly haven't fought with anyone else.
-My Exterion is also very strong, okay?

427
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,097
So what?

428
00:19:26,607 --> 00:19:28,707
What is your wish?

429
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,084
Go ahead and say it.

430
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:33,487
My wish…

431
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:35,701
My wish is…

432
00:19:44,307 --> 00:19:46,815
The outcome of our game
has not been decided yet.

433
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,706
Please play with me again sometime.

434
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,357
Konosuba.

435
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:08,200
Hey, shut up!

436
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:09,491
The neighbors would be irritated.

437
00:20:09,492 --> 00:20:11,309
Go yell in the suburbs.

438
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,491
Are you kidding me?

439
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:13,913
I can't believe you would
step in at that critical juncture.

440
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:16,491
-If you had not brought up the Devil King,
-Next, please sign this for me.

441
00:20:16,492 --> 00:20:19,611
Iris might have wished for something else.

442
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:21,403
"I want to be with older brother."

443
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:22,886
"I want to date older brother."

444
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:24,903
"I want to sleep with older brother."

445
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:27,288
How is that possible?

446
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:29,908
By the way, are you really certain

447
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:33,308
that you can win over a girl
to this degree in only a week?

448
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:35,107
You must confront the reality.

449
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,804
Do not bring me back
to reality all of a sudden.

450
00:20:37,805 --> 00:20:40,305
I don't want to hear
this kind of grandstanding.

451
00:20:42,596 --> 00:20:46,987
Just let me dream a little longer.

452
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,409
I was not expecting
the thief to steal the ring.

453
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:53,257
We really can't make up for this sin.

454
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:56,502
You both have already
put in a lot of effort.

455
00:20:57,202 --> 00:20:59,008
Do not be so hard on yourself.

456
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:01,498
Appreciate your understanding.

457
00:21:07,898 --> 00:21:10,399
That ring comes with a condition.

458
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:13,111
As a reward

459
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:14,034
for beating the Devil King,

460
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:18,607
the hero can marry the princess.

461
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:21,404
Brother…

462
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:26,904
I hope he will cherish the ring.

463
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,997
The sacred treasure…

464
00:23:01,998 --> 00:23:05,486
You mean that the thief
not only took my sacred treasure

465
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:07,711
but also sealed it?

466
00:23:08,193 --> 00:23:09,909
Get it back!

467
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:12,403
That's impossible.

468
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:15,017
I did not expect the sacred treasure
to be sealed.

469
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,107
I have already used up all my options.

470
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,392
You useless fellow!

471
00:23:20,393 --> 00:23:22,299
When exactly will you make

472
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,111
my wish come true?

473
00:23:31,044 --> 00:23:31,993
(Episode 7: Rest in Peace,
The Upstart Adventurer)

474
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,702
I am Sylvia.

475
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,397
I have completely gotten used
to vacationing.

476
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:38,195
This feeling of freedom

477
00:23:38,911 --> 00:23:39,904
is good.

478
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:41,418
A powerful woman…
