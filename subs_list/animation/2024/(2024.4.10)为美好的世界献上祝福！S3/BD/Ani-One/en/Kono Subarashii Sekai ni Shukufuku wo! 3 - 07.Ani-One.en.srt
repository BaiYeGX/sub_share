00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,902
To the adventurer Mr. Satou Kazuma,

2
00:00:03,494 --> 00:00:06,089
this is a heavyweight bounty target,

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,303
300 million Eris for capturing Sylvia,

4
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:11,992
the leader of the Devil King's Army.

5
00:00:13,189 --> 00:00:15,480
You are already the ace in this guild.

6
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,893
I heard that you also did
a great job in the royal capital.

7
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:20,485
In the beginning,
you couldn't even beat a frog killer.

8
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:21,194
No!

9
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:24,751
Kazuma has always struck me as a man
who takes things seriously when necessary.

10
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:27,787
The fact that his job is the worst
makes it even more impressive.

11
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,194
Hey, hey!

12
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,490
You will not get anywhere

13
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:31,600
by flattering me in this way.

14
00:00:32,403 --> 00:00:33,591
My best I can do is…

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,095
buy you the best bubble wine in this shop!

16
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,595
Mr. Kazuma, marry me!

17
00:00:43,596 --> 00:00:44,195
Sure.

18
00:00:44,196 --> 00:00:45,397
Please take me in!

19
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:46,596
I'd love to!

(Konosuba Season 3)

21
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:18,403
ONE WEEK LATER

22
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:21,131
Who made this dish?

23
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:23,433
Inform the chef who made this dish

24
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,224
that Satou Kazuma,

25
00:02:25,225 --> 00:02:28,740
who has become famous for sending off many
bounty targets, wants to meet with him!

26
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:30,521
Tell him that Miss Aqua,

27
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:32,767
the beautiful high priestess,
also wants to meet with him.

28
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:35,521
(Episode 7: Rest in Peace,
The Upstart Adventurer)

29
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,631
Excuse me.

30
00:02:36,632 --> 00:02:39,608
Is there something that neither
of you is happy with?

31
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:43,026
No, this dish tastes great.

32
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:44,229
Therefore I would like to
show my appreciation.

33
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:47,422
You are truly amazing for being able
to satisfy my taste buds

34
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:49,631
as someone who used to live in a castle.

35
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:51,529
Thank you.

36
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:58,522
The wine must have been added
to this stew to make it taste better, right?

37
00:03:01,934 --> 00:03:04,415
Red wine is what makes it sour.

38
00:03:04,416 --> 00:03:05,632
The brand is…

39
00:03:06,225 --> 00:03:10,027
Yeah, Romani Conti aged 30 years.

40
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,032
Am I right?

41
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,637
I used discounted vinegar.

42
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:23,621
Is that so?

43
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:27,131
You are truly amazing
for being able to make

44
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:28,625
such a tasty dish with cheap vinegar.

45
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,933
I am truly flattered.

46
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,726
Thank you.

47
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:34,521
The stew tastes great too.

48
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:37,538
But what made me applaud was this dish.

49
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:40,527
This taste is like…

50
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:46,928
sneaking into the room of the girl I like,

51
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,422
nervously opening
the closet to take a look,

52
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:51,433
and finding the wardrobe monster inside!

53
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:52,840
It is that strong

54
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,726
and shocking.

55
00:03:56,218 --> 00:03:57,230
How was my explanation?

56
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:58,220
Head chef, did you get it?

57
00:03:58,221 --> 00:03:59,439
I have no idea what you mean.

58
00:04:06,822 --> 00:04:07,923
Is that so?

59
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:10,428
To put it simply, it is really tasty.

60
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:14,037
Adventurer Satou Kazuma
gives this restaurant three stars.

61
00:04:14,038 --> 00:04:16,495
You get three stars from me too.

62
00:04:16,496 --> 00:04:18,230
Thank you all.

63
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:20,219
I will then try to get four stars

64
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,725
and keep getting better at cooking.

65
00:04:22,231 --> 00:04:23,346
Saying that is brave of you.

66
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,126
This is a thank-you gift
for the tasty meal.

67
00:04:27,421 --> 00:04:29,429
Save the change as a tip.

68
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,334
I'm done.

69
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:33,714
The money is just right.

70
00:04:33,715 --> 00:04:36,429
Welcome back for the next visit.

71
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:41,230
I like how the head chef
is easy to talk to.

72
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,438
Let us also ask for the most expensive

73
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:45,532
bubble wine at that restaurant tomorrow.

74
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:46,834
Hey, hey!

75
00:04:46,835 --> 00:04:50,631
Were we not supposed to eat tomorrow at the
world-renowned eatery that serves fantastical cuisine?

76
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:52,127
Oh, yeah.

77
00:04:57,828 --> 00:04:59,323
I'm…home.

78
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,132
Come on, come on.
You want this, don't you?

79
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:05,829
Such a perverted cross knight.

80
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,540
No way would I give in
to something like that.

81
00:05:12,622 --> 00:05:14,517
Please, you two, don't close the door!

82
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,429
It's not like that!

83
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,137
You have it wrong!

84
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:18,824
No, no, no, I get it!

85
00:05:18,825 --> 00:05:21,522
Aqua and I are going to eat out again,

86
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:24,439
or we might just stay
somewhere else today!

87
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,324
The Axis Order accepts all kinds of love.

88
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:30,163
Do you want me to cast a blessing spell?

89
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:32,934
No, you all just do not get it!

90
00:05:32,935 --> 00:05:34,326
Konosuba.

91
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:41,508
I was assisting her with
her endurance contest preparations.

92
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:43,404
Endurance contest?

93
00:05:44,894 --> 00:05:46,408
In the summertime endurance contest,

94
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:49,294
Darkness always comes out on top.

95
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:51,298
-Stop, stop it!
-Come on.

96
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,908
If you must practice,
why not at your house?

97
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,107
You are making this place very hot.

98
00:05:56,108 --> 00:05:59,717
Recently, my father's health has declined.

99
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,816
It will make him worry

100
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:03,158
about what is wrong
with his single daughter

101
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:05,705
if I do things like this at home.

102
00:06:05,706 --> 00:06:08,503
You have not done it at home yet, right?

103
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:12,202
It looks like my ability to
handle heat has also grown

104
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:14,804
since I started to level up last year.

105
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:15,790
Kazuma.

106
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,916
Sorry, help me untie this…

107
00:06:17,906 --> 00:06:18,903
Kazuma?

108
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:22,505
It seems like this scene
has been seen before.

109
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:24,107
What do you mean?

110
00:06:25,994 --> 00:06:27,890
T-That is…

111
00:06:28,208 --> 00:06:29,505
Hey, hey!

112
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:33,318
Miss Darkness, who completely
embarrassed me in the royal capital,

113
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,353
you are looking very silly today.

114
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:41,401
K-Kill me!

115
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,391
Konosuba.

116
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,395
Kazuma had a lot of fun
with my fiery body.

117
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:52,801
Hey, mind your language.

118
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:54,547
I just tickled you, right?

119
00:06:54,808 --> 00:06:56,098
Geez.

120
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,109
Where is the powerful Darkness

121
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,895
in the royal capital?

122
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,406
What is that?

123
00:07:01,407 --> 00:07:02,204
Oh dear.

124
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:04,588
You are interested in this already, huh?

125
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:06,400
Alright, I'll tell you.

126
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,208
Don't be shocked.

127
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:11,400
This is a dragon egg.

128
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:12,604
Dragon?

129
00:07:13,305 --> 00:07:15,802
When I was alone at home a while ago…

130
00:07:17,309 --> 00:07:19,943
It is a pleasure to meet you.

131
00:07:20,297 --> 00:07:21,807
Who are you?

132
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,010
I have been looking for someone like you,

133
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:28,494
an adventurer who can confront
the Devil King's Army.

134
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:30,202
I was shocked

135
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:32,724
by how beautiful you are.

136
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:33,906
Oh my.

137
00:07:33,907 --> 00:07:37,605
It is very uncommon to
find someone as pretty as I am.

138
00:07:39,302 --> 00:07:42,906
I hope you, who fight the Devil King's
Army despite the dangers,

139
00:07:42,907 --> 00:07:45,110
can accept this.

140
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:47,010
What is this?

141
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:49,796
This is a dragon egg.

142
00:07:49,797 --> 00:07:50,979
Dragon?

143
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,999
Yes.

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,593
I do not want the wealthy
to hoard it as a status symbol.

145
00:07:54,594 --> 00:07:56,890
I want to give it to you

146
00:07:56,891 --> 00:08:00,000
so you can face the Devil King in battle.

147
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:05,359
But a dragon egg is worth
at least a hundred million.

148
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,999
No, no, no, don't say that.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,697
I'd like to give it to you,
the strongest of the strong.

150
00:08:12,698 --> 00:08:14,307
It's just that…

151
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:15,390
It's just that…?

152
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:17,312
There's nobody around.

153
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:19,912
I would like to talk to you
about something.

154
00:08:21,797 --> 00:08:24,400
You didn't buy it, did you?

155
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:25,599
I did.

156
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,000
He told me that the cash
I have on hand is enough.

157
00:08:29,506 --> 00:08:31,599
It is a great deal.

158
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:35,208
I even named it.

159
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:37,308
Kingsford Jelteman.

160
00:08:37,806 --> 00:08:39,406
After all, I raised it.

161
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,598
There will come a time
when it rules over the dragon clan.

162
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,807
You all can call it Jelteman.

163
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,506
Are you an idiot?

164
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,599
Good morning.

165
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:54,307
Good morning.

166
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:55,494
Oh dear.

167
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:57,796
I worry a lot about Jelteman.

168
00:08:57,797 --> 00:08:59,911
Let's get things done
and head back quickly.

169
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:01,098
It is a chick, right?

170
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,499
It's not a chick.

171
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:02,995
No, no.

172
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:03,906
It's a dragon.

173
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:04,911
It is a chick, right?

174
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,807
I chose the good name Jelteman!

175
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:09,003
Please call it that!

176
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:10,505
Yeah, yeah.

177
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:13,114
We should be doing
more important things today, right?

178
00:09:15,099 --> 00:09:17,515
Is anybody there? Is anybody there?

179
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:20,499
A major client of yours has shown up!

180
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,697
Alright, hurry up!

181
00:09:21,698 --> 00:09:23,102
Hurry and open the door,
hurry and open the door!

182
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:25,104
Keep it low!

183
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:28,398
You must be preoccupied with
your thriving business during the day.

184
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,983
We specially got up early to come here.

185
00:09:29,984 --> 00:09:30,896
Be sure to thank us.

186
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:33,896
Don't disturb the neighbors, you nuisance!

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,603
You came here to get
that brat's money, right?

188
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:40,203
Go in and wait for me.

189
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,208
Konosuba.

190
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,998
This is the money that was agreed upon.

191
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:48,296
Be sure to thank me.

192
00:09:48,297 --> 00:09:49,544
I made a special effort to come here

193
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:51,337
for such a low-level demon.

194
00:09:51,338 --> 00:09:54,093
Quickly tell me "thank you."

195
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,406
Shut up!

196
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:58,304
Be careful, or I will curse you
with growing aloe vera on your buttocks!

197
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:02,593
The manager has been up all night
and is now sleeping inside!

198
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:04,203
Could you kindly lower
your volume a little?

199
00:10:04,815 --> 00:10:06,308
Is the profit really that high?

200
00:10:07,604 --> 00:10:10,603
It is very profitable.

201
00:10:10,604 --> 00:10:12,197
I have thought it over.

202
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:12,912
What?

203
00:10:12,913 --> 00:10:15,812
The store manager will definitely
mess up when she is by herself.

204
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:18,407
What can be done to keep her
from losing money?

205
00:10:18,902 --> 00:10:21,692
Thank you.

206
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:23,598
-I just recently learned
-Here you go.

207
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:25,416
that she will do pointless things

208
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,498
if she is not busy.

209
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:28,601
-So, to keep her busy,
-Here you go.

210
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:30,096
I made her work 24 hours a day.

211
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:32,014
She does not even have time to eat.

212
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:33,531
The outcome was very good.

213
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,388
After two weeks,

214
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:38,405
-she would start crying or laughing out of the blue,
-Thank…you…

215
00:10:38,406 --> 00:10:40,398
-even though nothing had happened.
-Thank…you…

216
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,805
-Her moods became very unstable.
-Thank…you…

217
00:10:42,806 --> 00:10:45,695
-She should not have been around other people,
-Thank…you…

218
00:10:45,696 --> 00:10:48,789
-so I gave her a break.
-Thank…you…

219
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,014
Come, come over here.

220
00:10:51,805 --> 00:10:53,612
Although she is an undead Lich,

221
00:10:53,613 --> 00:10:55,415
you should not wear her down that much.

222
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:57,716
With that said,

223
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:00,795
a curvy figure, working hard to maintain
its control all day long,

224
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:01,993
every night by herself?

225
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:03,810
Hey, what?

226
00:11:03,811 --> 00:11:05,794
Do not say only part of it,
it makes people interested!

227
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:06,602
Shut up!

228
00:11:06,603 --> 00:11:07,904
Kazuma, shut up!

229
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,695
Very humiliating evil ideas!

230
00:11:10,696 --> 00:11:11,794
Very good.

231
00:11:12,294 --> 00:11:13,705
The girl in armor.

232
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:16,607
You have a face of destruction.

233
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:23,690
The gloomy yet dazzling, glowing girl
always revolves around you.

234
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:25,807
It makes it hard for me
to see your future.

235
00:11:25,808 --> 00:11:27,405
As a token of my appreciation
for the successful business,

236
00:11:27,893 --> 00:11:29,784
allow me to predict your future.

237
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:35,398
Hey, I don't think
I'm the glowing girl, am I?

238
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,007
If not you, glowing girl,
who else could it be?

239
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:40,591
Your strange mask!

240
00:11:40,592 --> 00:11:41,898
S-Stop it already!

241
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:42,701
Don't touch my mask!

242
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,992
A face of destruction?

243
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:45,216
What? You really love to act cool.

244
00:11:45,217 --> 00:11:46,945
Hey, that's not important!

245
00:11:46,946 --> 00:11:48,790
What were you going to
call Darkness at first?

246
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,399
Tell me!

247
00:11:52,718 --> 00:11:54,988
One of my molars
is going to fall out any second.

248
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:59,010
-Now I am going to ask you a few questions.
-Good boy.

249
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,906
-Although it may be challenging,
-Good boy.

250
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:02,719
-you must answer honestly to all questions.
-Good boy.

251
00:12:06,512 --> 00:12:07,512
Okay.

252
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:09,205
First question.

253
00:12:10,098 --> 00:12:11,696
Despite your identity as a cross knight,

254
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:14,901
you have been covertly reducing
the weight of your armor as of late.

255
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:15,709
Why?

256
00:12:16,311 --> 00:12:18,303
Since I am clumsy,

257
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,012
I would prefer to have lighter armor

258
00:12:20,013 --> 00:12:22,744
so that I can attack enemies more easily.

259
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:26,507
Darkness has been giving it
some serious thought.

260
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:29,517
I said you must answer honestly.

261
00:12:32,313 --> 00:12:33,797
Since…

262
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:36,614
Since my abs have grown
more noticeable recently,

263
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:40,016
I wanted to make

264
00:12:40,017 --> 00:12:42,112
the armor

265
00:12:42,113 --> 00:12:43,203
lighter.

266
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:45,605
Do you have abs?

267
00:12:45,606 --> 00:12:46,999
Very well.

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,494
Next question.

269
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,901
That mage's dress

270
00:12:51,902 --> 00:12:54,813
that was thrown into
the bathroom laundry basket,

271
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:58,709
you stole it
and looked at it in the mirror,

272
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,714
-This does not look good on me
-telling yourself, "This does not look good on me."

273
00:13:01,715 --> 00:13:04,016
Why?

274
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,210
You say

275
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:08,808
it does not look good on you,
but when you look in the mirror,

276
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:11,620
you smile and tilt your head.

277
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:12,720
Why?

278
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:16,808
I-It is embarrassing for me
to buy cute clothes

279
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:18,418
because they do not suit me,

280
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:21,808
but I saw it out of the blue

281
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:22,720
and wanted to compare it

282
00:13:23,611 --> 00:13:26,403
to myself in the mirror.

283
00:13:29,116 --> 00:13:32,308
I took the cute dress

284
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:33,711
and compared it to my rough-muscled self

285
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,917
in the mirror for no reason.

286
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:37,209
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,504
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:38,914
I'm sorry…

289
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:42,907
Darkness would also look good
in cute dresses, in my opinion.

290
00:13:42,908 --> 00:13:44,912
You do look good in a dress, after all.

291
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:48,401
Why is it wrong for Darkness
to wear cute clothes behind us?

292
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:49,412
Right?

293
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:56,226
So last question.

294
00:13:56,616 --> 00:14:00,511
There is no doubt that man
looks at you with dirty eyes,

295
00:14:00,512 --> 00:14:02,818
but you dress in ways that show off
your body inside the house--

296
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:06,912
Is this really related to fortune-telling?

297
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:07,621
What?

298
00:14:08,298 --> 00:14:12,500
When did I say that I need
to ask questions to tell fortunes?

299
00:14:12,501 --> 00:14:13,418
What?

300
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:16,912
To tell fortunes, simply place
your hand on the crystal ball.

301
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:18,214
I am just asking questions
to pass the time--

302
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,401
I'm going to kill you!

303
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,980
(Konosuba)
Don't touch my mask!

304
00:14:23,808 --> 00:14:24,808
As expected.

305
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:27,307
A face of destruction has appeared.

306
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,511
Bad things might happen

307
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:32,522
to your home and your father.

308
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,006
Your sluggish mind

309
00:14:37,007 --> 00:14:39,412
will probably lead you
to act without thinking,

310
00:14:39,413 --> 00:14:41,632
believing that giving up oneself
will solve all problems.

311
00:14:42,311 --> 00:14:44,710
But if you do that, no one will be happy.

312
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,002
Huh?

313
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:48,813
It looks like you can't do
anything with your power.

314
00:14:50,616 --> 00:14:53,511
Forget about it all
and run away to some faraway place.

315
00:14:53,512 --> 00:14:55,797
There, you can start over
with that timid man

316
00:14:55,798 --> 00:14:57,353
who thinks he can get you

317
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,713
by forcefully pushing you,

318
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,298
but he lacks the guts to actually do it.

319
00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:03,006
Hey, wait!

320
00:15:03,007 --> 00:15:04,618
Seriously, wait!

321
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:06,113
It seems like my friends lose faith

322
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:09,619
in me every time you talk!

323
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,614
Vanir.

324
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:14,405
Thank you for your divination.

325
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,426
I will only partially believe you.

326
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:22,810
We just got a lot of money, Kazuma.

327
00:15:22,811 --> 00:15:25,113
I think we don't need
to go on any missions right now.

328
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:28,114
I have decided to return to see my father,

329
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:30,704
despite the fact that I am unconcerned
about the fortune-telling.

330
00:15:30,705 --> 00:15:32,109
Okay.

331
00:15:36,608 --> 00:15:37,502
Kid.

332
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:43,716
I have some new advice for you.

333
00:15:45,395 --> 00:15:49,097
Do not be happy just
because you got a reward,

334
00:15:49,098 --> 00:15:52,218
you should make more
products that sell well instead.

335
00:15:52,902 --> 00:15:55,212
I told that girl,

336
00:15:55,213 --> 00:15:58,208
"It looks like you can't do
anything with your power."

337
00:15:59,007 --> 00:16:01,816
However, based on your efforts,

338
00:16:01,817 --> 00:16:04,520
it is possible that you are
capable of doing something.

339
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:09,202
Take this!

340
00:16:12,313 --> 00:16:13,614
What's this?

341
00:16:26,306 --> 00:16:29,827
Even in the summer, you will
not be shedding any fur, will you?

342
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,706
Kazuma!

343
00:16:33,707 --> 00:16:35,904
What the heck! You startled me!

344
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:37,910
It is time to go after
those bounty monsters!

345
00:16:38,605 --> 00:16:41,013
Being a young woman who is not married,

346
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:42,806
you should not be going out
all the time at night.

347
00:16:42,807 --> 00:16:45,019
I am not going out
for no reason, you idiot!

348
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
Look at this!

349
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,696
Multihead Water Snake?

350
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:50,812
It's a heavyweight bounty monster.

351
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:52,816
Some days ago,

352
00:16:52,817 --> 00:16:56,540
the water snake that was sleeping
at the lake's bottom seemed to wake up.

353
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,406
That is what you wanted to hunt?

354
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,958
It is too early in the morning

355
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:01,394
to start talking big.

356
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:04,197
Do you not want to protect Axel?

357
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:11,415
Come on, Satou Kazuma,
the hero who defeated many

358
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,821
of Leaders of Devil King's Army.

359
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:15,517
It is your time to shine.

360
00:17:18,811 --> 00:17:21,014
You think I will agree with you

361
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:23,023
if you call me a hero?

362
00:17:23,024 --> 00:17:24,805
I have made enough cash already.

363
00:17:24,806 --> 00:17:26,110
Nothing else?

364
00:17:26,111 --> 00:17:29,222
Isn't there anything
that can make me more motivated?

365
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:29,990
What?

366
00:17:30,807 --> 00:17:33,019
You should know me well since we have

367
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,411
known each other for a long time.

368
00:17:37,204 --> 00:17:38,910
I-I get it.

369
00:17:39,613 --> 00:17:41,212
If we successfully hunted it,

370
00:17:42,011 --> 00:17:43,113
as a reward…

371
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:44,420
Um…

372
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:45,487
What?

373
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:47,613
What do you want to give me?

374
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:50,718
I will kiss your cheek.

375
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,207
Rejected.

376
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:55,811
What?

377
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:58,514
These days, no one would
risk their life just for a kiss.

378
00:17:58,515 --> 00:18:00,906
J-Just for a kiss?

379
00:18:01,702 --> 00:18:03,404
Hey, Chomusuke.

380
00:18:03,405 --> 00:18:04,816
This woman

381
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:08,003
seems to really think that her one kiss

382
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:10,102
could make a man risk his life.

383
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:12,812
How much self-esteem does she have?

384
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:16,211
Y-You jerk!

385
00:18:16,212 --> 00:18:18,248
How dare you take advantage of me?

386
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:19,696
Hey, stop it!

387
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:21,025
I am against violence!

388
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:40,003
Hey.

389
00:18:40,004 --> 00:18:42,223
Can't we go?

390
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:53,613
(Konosuba)
She is actually begging me…

391
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:55,416
Isn't she getting smart?

392
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:58,310
I don't want to!

393
00:18:58,311 --> 00:19:00,649
I am not interested
in looking for water snakes!

394
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,805
Darkness, why do you want
to subdue a bounty target?

395
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:06,618
Are you really a penniless noble?

396
00:19:08,212 --> 00:19:10,306
-When you talk about water snakes, you automatically think of dragons.
-I don't want to, I don't want to!

397
00:19:10,307 --> 00:19:12,295
-Just beating it
-Why do I have to do it?

398
00:19:12,296 --> 00:19:13,091
would let me call myself a dragon slayer!

399
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:15,716
I want to be known as the "dragon slayer"!

400
00:19:15,717 --> 00:19:18,597
We will be able to raise dragons
at home after Jelteman is born!

401
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:21,101
Why do you want such a terrible title?

402
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:25,896
Also, why do I have to leave
Jelteman with Wiz's shop?

403
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:27,908
-What can we do?
-Why?

404
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:29,455
-We cannot ask anyone else for hatching eggs,
-Why?

405
00:19:29,456 --> 00:19:31,304
-that would be silly.
-Why?

406
00:19:31,305 --> 00:19:33,700
It worries me that entrusting it
to Lich and the demon

407
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:36,623
will have a bad effect on Jelteman!

408
00:19:37,008 --> 00:19:37,920
Listen up.

409
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:39,606
The longer a mother dragon
carefully holds an egg,

410
00:19:39,607 --> 00:19:42,309
the more powerful the magic
it will receive,

411
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,716
and it will take on the traits

412
00:19:43,717 --> 00:19:46,326
of both its parents!

413
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,102
I really hope it hatches
into a sacred white dragon.

414
00:19:50,103 --> 00:19:52,106
-It could be affected by the darkness
-Thank…you…

415
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,706
and hatch into a black dragon
or something!

416
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:59,617
Then let us quickly beat
the water snake and go back.

417
00:20:00,223 --> 00:20:01,613
Alright then.

418
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,919
Then I'll go have a look.

419
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,686
Let us run away right away

420
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:07,509
if Megumin's magic does not work.

421
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:10,483
(Konosuba)
Okay, let us start.

422
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:18,003
She is not playing in the water, right?

423
00:20:18,004 --> 00:20:19,711
She's purifying it, right?

424
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,117
Because monsters hate clean water.

425
00:20:25,414 --> 00:20:28,523
Please cast your Explosion magic

426
00:20:28,524 --> 00:20:29,805
after Aqua has purified the water
and lured the water snake.

427
00:20:30,424 --> 00:20:31,315
Hey.

428
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:32,919
That Aqua

429
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,101
has started to sleep right above
where the heavyweight

430
00:20:35,102 --> 00:20:36,509
bounty target was.

431
00:20:38,722 --> 00:20:39,794
Are we going to tie her up
with a rope first

432
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:41,493
to keep her from floating away?

433
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:45,212
Here it comes!

434
00:20:45,213 --> 00:20:47,523
I feel a huge amount of magic power!

435
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:48,816
Aqua!

436
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:50,294
Time to wake up!

437
00:20:50,295 --> 00:20:52,123
Wake up quickly!

438
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:55,611
-Aqua, look below!
-Aqua, wake up!

439
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:58,221
-So noisy.
-Hurry up and get out of the water.

440
00:20:58,222 --> 00:20:58,907
Look.

441
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:01,408
Water has been thoroughly purified.

442
00:21:01,409 --> 00:21:04,217
Then I should also leave the lake.

443
00:21:05,107 --> 00:21:06,210
Mr. Kazuma!

444
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:07,492
Mr. Kazuma!

445
00:21:07,493 --> 00:21:11,001
It seems like something
huge is approaching!

446
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:15,014
No, please!

447
00:21:19,408 --> 00:21:20,914
I want to go home!

448
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:24,410
I want to go home already!

449
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,199
Aqua!

450
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:28,420
No way!

451
00:21:28,421 --> 00:21:30,821
It is not possible for me to
use explosive magic right now!

452
00:21:42,316 --> 00:21:43,825
Mr. Kazuma!

453
00:21:43,826 --> 00:21:46,414
Mr. Kazuma!

454
00:21:46,956 --> 00:21:52,310
I really want to go home!

455
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:56,606
-This guy…
-I want to go home…

456
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:00,003
-This is not good…
-I want to go home…

457
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,003
(Episode 8: Eternal Rest
to The Lord of This Lake)

458
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:32,689
I am Beldia.

459
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,392
Is that guy named Satou Kazuma?

460
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:38,903
I sometimes hear about what he did.

461
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:40,195
He's still alive…
