1
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:02,711
So…

2
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:06,197
So you just came to my place?

3
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:08,604
Yes, though I don't want to.

4
00:00:08,605 --> 00:00:10,104
Geez.

5
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:13,302
Kazuma, why don't
you just stay out of this?

6
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:15,306
I will help you
because I have no other choice.

7
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,807
But you can't boss me around anymore.

8
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:20,354
Gosh, I can't stand you.

9
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:21,703
Yeah.

10
00:00:21,704 --> 00:00:25,812
No more calling us troublemakers.

11
00:00:25,813 --> 00:00:27,505
After all, we're companions.

12
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:30,298
Of course, I'll help you,
I won't leave you to die.

13
00:00:31,094 --> 00:00:33,098
You, the crazy magician.

14
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,400
You are not going to blow up my house

15
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:37,495
like you did the last time, are you?

16
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,505
Say what?

17
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:40,801
But…

18
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:43,697
It really hurts my heart

19
00:00:43,698 --> 00:00:46,504
if you believe those bad rumors

20
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,193
and do not trust me.

21
00:00:48,194 --> 00:00:52,103
T-This is just part of the investigation.

22
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:55,556
Of course, I know, Lady Dustiness.

23
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:59,604
Please make yourself at home,
just stay as long as you like.

24
00:01:00,599 --> 00:01:03,604
We are allowed to stay as long as we want.

25
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,801
I want to stay in the largest room.

26
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:08,401
Kazuma, that's not fair!

27
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,452
I want the room closest
to the dining room.

28
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:13,906
-I want to live in the room at the top of this house.
-Hey, wait a minute.

29
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,197
Hey, Aqua, what are you doing up here?

30
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:19,598
-What's the matter, can't I come up?
-I am sorry my companion is being so rude.

31
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:21,203
-You should all sleep down there together.
-Both of you come down now.

32
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:24,303
It seems you're having
a hard time too, Lady Dustiness.

33
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,202
-I'm sorry.
-Maid! Is there a maid here?

34
00:01:27,203 --> 00:01:31,094
I am sorry my companion is being so rude.

35
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:47,089
(Konosuba Season 3)

36
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:00,506
(Episode 4: Divine Punishment
for This Handsome Chivalrous Thief)

37
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:03,303
My plan has gone awry.

38
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:06,500
I really want to return
to the cozy castle.

39
00:03:07,198 --> 00:03:09,417
Iris, I will do my best.

40
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:13,209
Thieves usually break in
at night, do not they?

41
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:16,696
What is this room for?

42
00:03:21,405 --> 00:03:22,796
Hey, it's you!

43
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,406
-There's nothing here.
-My name is Kazuma.

44
00:03:24,407 --> 00:03:26,881
Keep from wandering around aimlessly.

45
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:29,401
What are you looking at?

46
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:30,199
Hey!

47
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:35,610
A bathhouse?

48
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,912
Is this a two-way mirror?

49
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:40,703
Darkness is going to live here,

50
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:42,407
so you're here to clean the mirror?

51
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:45,600
D-Do you want to watch it together?

52
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:48,394
How could I have fallen for that?

53
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,203
Alright, hurry up and get out.

54
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:51,407
I'll stay in this room.

55
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:57,098
Wait, you want to stay in this room?

56
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,197
Hey, don't get the wrong idea, okay?

57
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,708
I am only staying in this room

58
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,296
to protect my companions.

59
00:04:03,297 --> 00:04:04,500
Nonsense!

60
00:04:04,501 --> 00:04:05,906
How can I let a little brat like you

61
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:08,598
look at Lalatina's naked body?

62
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:09,500
Unfortunately,

63
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:12,401
I've already bathed with Darkness.

64
00:04:12,402 --> 00:04:13,604
Do you want everyone in the house

65
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:15,406
to know about this room?

66
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:17,192
This is a trade!

67
00:04:17,193 --> 00:04:19,093
Be a good boy and keep quiet

68
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:20,610
if you do not want
the maids to despise you.

69
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,807
Dealing with

70
00:04:22,808 --> 00:04:24,807
sexual harassment is part of being a maid.

71
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:27,708
I take it that you want
to make a deal with me?

72
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:31,192
You always give off
a vibe that is like mine.

73
00:04:31,193 --> 00:04:34,000
Now is the time for us to work together.

74
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:35,901
Flip.

75
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:38,692
Sounds interesting, huh?

76
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:41,464
Tell me exactly
what you are talking about.

77
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:46,808
This guy wants to peep…

78
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,042
(Konosuba)
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,897
Then three days went by.

80
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,193
We are happy living at the mansion.

81
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:59,599
There are no signs of any cases happening.

82
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,699
Oh, you're having lunch too?

83
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,308
Good morning.

84
00:05:12,004 --> 00:05:14,105
It's already past noon now.

85
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:16,593
It was on purpose that I stayed up late

86
00:05:16,594 --> 00:05:18,796
to keep thieves out.

87
00:05:18,797 --> 00:05:19,895
By the way,

88
00:05:19,896 --> 00:05:21,109
I heard that you stayed up every night

89
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:24,698
while I was away from Axel.

90
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,005
Um…Well…

91
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:29,705
Your sudden disappearance worried me.

92
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:33,121
That's not important.
Are there signs of thieves breaking in?

93
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,302
What are you panicking about?

94
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:37,406
I see, you were really worried about me.

95
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,598
I never thought
you would be cute sometimes.

96
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,802
You are clearly weak,

97
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:43,505
but you always manage to get into trouble!

98
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:45,100
And on top of that, you die easily.

99
00:05:45,407 --> 00:05:48,302
It is not my desire to be in trouble.

100
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:50,313
It is also not my choice to die.

101
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,313
What's going on?
It's like a romantic comedy.

102
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,906
I would not know what to say

103
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:58,313
if you suddenly took this
so seriously, okay?

104
00:05:58,905 --> 00:05:59,803
Kazuma.

105
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:01,895
Do you want to

106
00:06:01,896 --> 00:06:04,000
go on a date with me after breakfast?

107
00:06:04,985 --> 00:06:06,807
Flip.

108
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,647
Explosion!

109
00:06:20,198 --> 00:06:22,507
I knew it!

110
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,105
Explosion!

111
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:32,203
-What's wrong? Is it the Devil King's Army?
-That scared me.

112
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:37,397
Sion!

113
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,318
-What's that all about?
-No!

114
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:44,901
The pesky noise you are making

115
00:06:44,902 --> 00:06:47,296
has already riled up
the royal capital's populace.

116
00:06:47,297 --> 00:06:49,807
Seems like I have made
quite a name for myself.

117
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:53,495
I should have let you learn
some advanced magic.

118
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,207
You just said something
that can't be ignored, right?

119
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,197
Thus and so.

120
00:06:58,198 --> 00:06:59,510
Hey.

121
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:01,677
Don't underestimate the water goddess.

122
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:02,703
Aqua drank all the wine

123
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:04,500
-in the mansion's cellar in this week.
-There's an expensive wine in the study, isn't there?

124
00:07:04,501 --> 00:07:05,699
-in the mansion's cellar in this week.
-Hurry up and bring it here.

125
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:10,911
At that moment,
my explosion magic detonated.

126
00:07:10,912 --> 00:07:12,895
Poor Hans, a leader of Devil King's Army.

127
00:07:12,896 --> 00:07:14,906
I blew him to pieces.

128
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:15,709
Now, let us talk about

129
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:21,203
-how active I was when I was fighting against Sylvia,
-Megumin keeps talking about her heroic deeds every day.

130
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:22,901
-who was a leader of Devil King's Army.
-As for me…

131
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,611
Lady! Lady!

132
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,500
Please give me a massage.

133
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:30,494
Tomorrow, I want to eat sukiyaki made
from a giant wild buffalo.

134
00:07:30,495 --> 00:07:32,802
Also, the down comforter
I ordered has arrived.

135
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:34,407
Please put it in my room.

136
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,027
L-Lady Dustiness…

137
00:07:38,103 --> 00:07:39,802
Um…

138
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:41,197
Sorry, although I said before,

139
00:07:41,198 --> 00:07:43,003
please make yourself at home…

140
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,687
You don't have to say it.

141
00:07:44,688 --> 00:07:47,193
(Konosuba)
We'll leave right away.

142
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:52,304
Now that I have slept too much
during the day, I am out of sleep.

143
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,006
Let us go for a midnight snack.

144
00:07:55,704 --> 00:07:58,313
We have to leave here tomorrow.

145
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:02,308
Is that Aqua?

146
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:04,093
Surprisingly, no one is on guard.

147
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:05,693
Am I overthinking it?

148
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:10,812
It looks like luck has finally
come on the last day.

149
00:08:10,813 --> 00:08:13,204
Goddess of luck, Lady Eris, thank you.

150
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:16,901
I just felt like there was someone there.

151
00:08:16,902 --> 00:08:18,308
Lurk.

152
00:08:18,993 --> 00:08:20,193
I am probably overthinking it.

153
00:08:20,797 --> 00:08:23,500
The treasure sensor says
that the treasure is at…

154
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:26,297
Over here?

155
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:28,911
Caught you!

156
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:30,307
Alright, surrender!

157
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:31,598
This is your toughest opponent yet,

158
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,395
you disgusting thief who is causing chaos.

159
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:35,005
I am not like those fools.

160
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:36,807
I once went up against
the leaders of Devil King's Army,

161
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,802
so do not ever think
you can get away from me.

162
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:39,803
Stop, wait!

163
00:08:39,804 --> 00:08:41,303
Are you…

164
00:08:41,697 --> 00:08:44,697
What's going on? I recognize this voice.

165
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:46,406
No way could you be Kazuma, could you?

166
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:49,593
The place you are grabbing
is a bad one right now.

167
00:08:49,594 --> 00:08:51,808
What are you talking about?
I'm just apprehending an intruder.

168
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,200
It's me!

169
00:08:57,407 --> 00:08:59,697
Chris, are you
the rumored chivalrous thief?

170
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:01,401
I can't get married now.

171
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:04,197
What can I do? I thought you were a thief.

172
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:07,099
Why are you in this place?

173
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:10,203
Is Darkness in this house?

174
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:11,692
Oh no, this is bad.

175
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:14,204
If she finds out I am doing this,
she will be furious.

176
00:09:14,205 --> 00:09:16,297
If you truly say sorry to her,

177
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:17,692
she probably will not kill you.

178
00:09:17,693 --> 00:09:19,099
Repent well.

179
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,901
No, that's not it!

180
00:09:20,902 --> 00:09:22,704
There's a reason I'm doing this.

181
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:28,505
Has he left?

182
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:31,798
Can't be helped,
I'll just tell you the truth.

183
00:09:33,107 --> 00:09:33,709
Actually…

184
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,906
No, I don't want to hear it.

185
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,610
Why not?

186
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:36,992
I have a feeling it will get me
into trouble again.

187
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,302
Just like always.

188
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,479
But…

189
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,802
Don't say it!

190
00:09:40,803 --> 00:09:41,906
Okay, before anyone else comes,

191
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:42,595
hurry up and run away.

192
00:09:42,596 --> 00:09:43,604
I'll let you off the hook.

193
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:44,792
No. Um…

194
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,302
I have a favor to ask of you.

195
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,901
I don't want to hear it,
I don't want to hear it!

196
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:49,401
And think about it carefully.

197
00:09:49,402 --> 00:09:50,505
The lord known

198
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,599
for being a horny jerk is coming later.

199
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,302
If he sees that you have been caught,

200
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,303
he will definitely…

201
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:57,698
Someone's coming.

202
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,500
I'll retreat for today.

203
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:01,807
I will come back here and explain why.

204
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:03,297
There is no need to come anymore.

205
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:05,198
Rather than that, tie me up.

206
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:07,510
That way, I can claim that you fled.

207
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:08,797
Got it.

208
00:10:08,798 --> 00:10:09,803
Bind.

209
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,511
I'm off.

210
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,401
Are you okay, Kazuma?

211
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:17,604
Have you been hit with Bind?

212
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:18,506
Where's the thief?

213
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:22,012
Unfortunately, I almost caught him.

214
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,000
I was really too careless.

215
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,506
Hurry up and untie me.

216
00:10:26,005 --> 00:10:27,203
Did he run away?

217
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:28,906
You're not hurt, are you?

218
00:10:28,907 --> 00:10:30,432
What did the thief look like?

219
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:34,396
Uh…It was a man wearing a suspicious mask.

220
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:35,204
It could be someone

221
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:37,803
even stronger than
Leaders of Devil King's Army.

222
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,204
Th-That strong?

223
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:42,104
Speaking of which, Kazuma,

224
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:43,906
despite your scraggy appearance,

225
00:10:43,907 --> 00:10:45,698
are you really unable to move right now?

226
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:47,604
Isn't that obvious?

227
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,995
I chased him right up until the end.

228
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,515
Stop talking and untie me quickly!

229
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:52,302
It's really uncomfortable.

230
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,208
Kazuma.

231
00:10:56,209 --> 00:10:57,703
I know now is not
the right time to say this,

232
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:00,100
but I am sorry for something I did.

233
00:11:00,898 --> 00:11:02,443
What is it? Go ahead.

234
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:03,914
I'm telling you.

235
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,109
You did not return

236
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,593
after being taken away, right?

237
00:11:08,594 --> 00:11:10,198
What? Right.

238
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:12,099
I looked around in your room

239
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,793
to pass the time at that time.

240
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:15,406
So,

241
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:17,708
I broke that thing that looked like a doll

242
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,214
you were half way through making.

243
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:20,704
This jerk…

244
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:22,692
It's okay.

245
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:24,010
I can make a new one.

246
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,100
Hurry up
and release me from this restraint.

247
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:26,995
Are you willing to forgive me?

248
00:11:26,996 --> 00:11:29,692
Then I might as well say it all now.

249
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:31,015
Actually, I figured it

250
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:32,500
would be fine to drink bubble wine there

251
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:33,501
since nobody was

252
00:11:33,502 --> 00:11:34,791
using the room anyway.

253
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:36,302
Because, you see, if I drink in my room,

254
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:38,588
I will have to clean up the food
and empty the bottles,

255
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:39,692
which is a headache.

256
00:11:39,693 --> 00:11:41,491
And then I got drunk at that time.

257
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,604
I broke a lot of other things.

258
00:11:44,907 --> 00:11:45,995
Sorry about that.

259
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:48,303
Really want to beat her up.

260
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:49,791
I-It's okay.

261
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,501
After all, we are very good friends.

262
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,304
It was wrong of me not to go back.

263
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:54,544
Alright, let's not talk about that.

264
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:55,800
Hurry up and untie me.

265
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:01,794
This situation is indeed
what Aqua described.

266
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:04,904
It looks quite interesting.

267
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,893
What exactly happened?

268
00:12:09,903 --> 00:12:11,497
Help!

269
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:12,502
Come on, speak up.

270
00:12:12,503 --> 00:12:15,200
Quickly say, "I apologize for
being too arrogant lately."

271
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,002
You just keep causing me trouble.

272
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,403
Say your apologies quickly.

273
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,601
Quickly say, "Sorry, I embarrassed you."

274
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:22,002
I'm sorry.

275
00:12:22,003 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

276
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:27,893
-I'm sorry I've embarrassed you.
-Say that again.

277
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:30,398
Hurry up, that cool line.

278
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,502
How many points?

279
00:12:31,503 --> 00:12:33,393
How many points is my Explosion worth?

280
00:12:33,394 --> 00:12:34,212
Don't do this.

281
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,298
It only needs to be said once.

282
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,804
Come on, tell me.

283
00:12:37,805 --> 00:12:38,493
Alright, alright.

284
00:12:38,494 --> 00:12:40,304
Don't be shy, tell me.

285
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:42,398
It's very embarrassing.

286
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,403
-It is not bad to switch roles every so then.
-Quickly save me.

287
00:12:45,404 --> 00:12:47,409
-Alright, go ahead and say it.
-Lord Aldarp.

288
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,498
I see.

289
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,211
You were so sure of yourself
when you said it,

290
00:12:55,212 --> 00:12:56,794
but you failed?

291
00:12:56,795 --> 00:13:01,200
So, the thief is a powerful thief
with a mask?

292
00:13:01,201 --> 00:13:02,698
Yes.

293
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,410
But you can't say it was a total failure.

294
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,101
Without me,

295
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:09,309
Aldarp would have been in trouble now.

296
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,893
He's just third-rate.

297
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:13,003
So he's a third-rate adventurer.

298
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:17,304
These are the words of Mr. Kazuma,
who has fought

299
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:18,800
with many of Leaders of Devil King's Army.

300
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:22,910
Yeah, it seems that chivalrous thief
is really something.

301
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,706
Wait, Kazuma is…

302
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:29,511
Um…

303
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,508
Anyway, good job.

304
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,893
It is not a failure because you did not
catch the chivalrous thief,

305
00:13:35,894 --> 00:13:38,706
but rather a success
because you prevented him from stealing.

306
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,394
No one can blame you.

307
00:13:45,707 --> 00:13:48,305
You should be grateful
for Princess Iris's mercy.

308
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:52,393
But you have no reason to
stay in the city any longer.

309
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:53,956
Alright, leave quickly.

310
00:14:00,903 --> 00:14:02,393
The bubble wine in the royal capital

311
00:14:02,394 --> 00:14:04,601
is not as good as the rumors suggest.

312
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:06,198
It's a souvenir.

313
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,299
You've got no sense.

314
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,804
I'm really depressed.

315
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:12,100
Anyway, you have nothing
to do today, right?

316
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,003
This jerk…

317
00:14:13,498 --> 00:14:16,502
The bubble wine sold
in Mr. Michael's store

318
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:18,305
in Axel Town is much better.

319
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:20,799
Who is Mr. Michael?

320
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,217
The number of your friends
in town is growing.

321
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:26,698
Long ago, an elderly gentleman
expressed his gratitude

322
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,705
for your assistance in healing his wound

323
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:30,352
by presenting us
with a gift of premium meat.

324
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:33,502
I have never heard of this before.

325
00:14:33,503 --> 00:14:36,393
I do not recall getting that meat.

326
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:38,612
I asked Darkness to cook it.

327
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:39,399
The two of us ate it.

328
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,701
-What?
-Ouch!

329
00:14:40,702 --> 00:14:42,195
-I didn't get a single bite!
-What are you doing, jerk?

330
00:14:42,196 --> 00:14:44,492
-What a coincidence that we have met here.
-You're…

331
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:45,598
Lady Aqua.

332
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:51,305
Who are you?

333
00:14:51,306 --> 00:14:53,497
I see that you still like to joke around.

334
00:14:53,498 --> 00:14:54,507
Lady Aqua.

335
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:57,352
Hey, this guy is really good
at pretending to know us.

336
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:59,502
Um… it's me.

337
00:14:59,503 --> 00:15:02,404
The Swordsmanship Master
who was granted a Cursed Sword by you…

338
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:04,799
It's Mr. Katsuragi,
you've seen him before, right?

339
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,617
Who's that? I'm Mitsurugi.

340
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:08,102
(Konosuba)
My name is Mitsurugi.

341
00:15:09,205 --> 00:15:10,987
Are you familiar
with the person whose name is Mitsurugi?

342
00:15:10,988 --> 00:15:13,204
It's the wielder of the Cursed Sword…

343
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:16,908
You can't be seriously mistaken.

344
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:19,305
Can you try calling me by my first name?

345
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,903
We do not know each other well
enough to use our first names.

346
00:15:22,904 --> 00:15:23,810
It's Kyouya!

347
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:25,612
Honestly say you don't remember if you do.

348
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:27,103
My name is Mitsurugi Kyouya.

349
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:29,807
Forget it.

350
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:31,998
It's not important, Lady Aqua.

351
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:36,414
I am so glad that we got to
see each other again today.

352
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:38,806
What, you want to give it to me?

353
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:43,201
I came across this on my trip.

354
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:46,107
I am not sure if you would like it.

355
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:49,997
So cool, really so cool!

356
00:15:49,998 --> 00:15:51,263
It's really infuriating!

357
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:55,607
It's too small, I can't wear it.

358
00:15:59,404 --> 00:16:01,502
(Konosuba)
Excuse me, three bubble wine, please.

359
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,295
Wake up quickly.

360
00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:12,117
Hey, wake up quickly.

361
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:17,299
Hey, Kazu--

362
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,701
Thief!

363
00:16:19,404 --> 00:16:20,497
It's me, it's me.

364
00:16:20,498 --> 00:16:21,908
Stop, where are you touching?

365
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,601
Stop. Darkness!

366
00:16:23,602 --> 00:16:25,294
Darkness, help me!

367
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:26,295
(Konosuba)
What? So it's you, Chris.

368
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:27,701
It's me!

369
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:32,200
You hugged me
because you knew it was me, right?

370
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:34,205
Nocturnal visits a man's room

371
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:35,502
and then screams out loud
at the slightest touch?

372
00:16:35,503 --> 00:16:37,204
What kind of seduction method is that?

373
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:39,705
This is neither a nocturnal visit
nor a seduction method.

374
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:40,602
I said I would come back

375
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:43,002
and explain why, didn't I?

376
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:45,299
Hey. You.

377
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,706
Don't pretend you didn't hear.

378
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:50,002
I told you I did not want
to hear your reason.

379
00:16:50,003 --> 00:16:51,299
Talk about it next time.

380
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,299
To be specific,
let's talk about it next year.

381
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,200
I must explain it now.

382
00:16:55,201 --> 00:16:56,705
Please, listen to me.

383
00:16:56,706 --> 00:16:59,487
Listen to me…

384
00:16:59,488 --> 00:17:01,394
Alright, what is it?

385
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:07,002
I am collecting super strong, rare items
known as sacred treasure.

386
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:07,993
Sacred treasure?

387
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:10,398
Sounds troublesome.
I don't want to hear anymore.

388
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,408
Listen to me, please.

389
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,299
I have heard that adventurers
with black hair, eyes,

390
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,993
and a weird name are
the only ones who can get that item.

391
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,601
Names as weird as yours.

392
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:19,717
Don't say my name is weird.

393
00:17:20,898 --> 00:17:24,601
Is not that just the cheat item that
reincarnated people receive at the start?

394
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:26,394
Is Chris looking for that?

395
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,695
I heard its effects vary.

396
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:30,700
It can grant immense attack power.

397
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,805
Or bring about great wealth.

398
00:17:33,704 --> 00:17:34,704
Wealth…

399
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:44,304
So it was you?

400
00:17:44,305 --> 00:17:45,492
Sorry, sorry!

401
00:17:45,493 --> 00:17:47,398
However, sacred treasure
is extremely dangerous.

402
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,606
It must be retrieved.

403
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:51,112
Who is going to retrieve it?
What's the purpose?

404
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,113
Well…

405
00:17:52,601 --> 00:17:53,908
To protect my client's privacy,

406
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:55,607
I can't say anything.

407
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,800
Then I'm out of this.

408
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,106
What follows is the important part.

409
00:17:59,107 --> 00:18:02,903
Actually, the castle also gives off
a powerful aura of treasure.

410
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:05,862
It is hardly surprising
that the castle houses powerful treasure.

411
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:08,507
Exactly, so I want to ask for your help.

412
00:18:08,508 --> 00:18:09,700
See? I knew it. No need to say more.

413
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:11,612
I do not wish to get into more trouble.

414
00:18:11,613 --> 00:18:14,388
You do have night vision, right?

415
00:18:14,389 --> 00:18:16,408
And the skills of lurking
and sensing enemies.

416
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:18,414
Use these skills and come search with me.

417
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:21,393
Don't make me an accomplice to a crime.

418
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:22,601
The bad feeling came true.

419
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,794
I am not going to assist you with that.

420
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:27,653
Dude, you are being really icy.

421
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:30,101
Scram, scram, go back already.

422
00:18:30,102 --> 00:18:30,914
I will use the bind you cast yesterday

423
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:32,606
to capture and molestation you

424
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:34,404
if you don't go back.

425
00:18:35,784 --> 00:18:37,315
I'll retreat for today then.

426
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:39,695
I will talk about it
with you again tomorrow.

427
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:41,591
I've told you not to come back, right?

428
00:18:41,592 --> 00:18:42,472
Bind.

429
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:45,811
I am going to let you off today.

430
00:18:49,113 --> 00:18:50,113
Geez.

431
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:53,904
I wish she'd stop coming.

432
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,700
Lady Eris.

433
00:18:57,701 --> 00:18:59,304
You can have me join the Eris Order

434
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,606
after I get back to Axel.

435
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:05,300
Please grant me a peaceful life.

436
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,898
Devil King's Army alert!

437
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:19,407
Devil King's Army alert!

438
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,497
The plains near the royal capital
are now being occupied by

439
00:19:21,498 --> 00:19:23,612
groups thought to be
the Devil King's Army.

440
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:24,992
Knights, please get ready.

441
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:27,002
We implore you, all advanced
adventurers in the royal capital,

442
00:19:27,003 --> 00:19:28,154
to join the fight as well.

443
00:19:28,596 --> 00:19:30,001
Kazuma, this is bad!

444
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,289
Quickly get ready.

445
00:19:31,701 --> 00:19:32,804
I'm sleeping.

446
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,492
Now is not the time to joke around.

447
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:36,205
The Devil King's Army has appeared!

448
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:37,997
We also have to hurry and join the battle.

449
00:19:37,998 --> 00:19:40,002
You are the one joking, right?

450
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:42,205
Please listen to the broadcast properly!

451
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:44,205
She said "advanced," right?

452
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:45,997
I can barely be considered intermediate.

453
00:19:45,998 --> 00:19:46,909
Also,

454
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,794
this royal capital is full
of skilled adventurers everywhere.

455
00:19:48,795 --> 00:19:50,789
Even without us, they could win easily.

456
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,399
You useless jerk.

457
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,306
Forget it, I'll take Aqua
and Megumin to the battle.

458
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,405
The lower-level adventurers should
simply shiver under their blankets.

459
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:04,497
I don't want!

460
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:07,799
Why do I have to go
somewhere so dangerous?

461
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,294
I came to the royal capital to have fun.

462
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:12,908
I have no desire to fight
the Devil King's Army.

463
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:14,799
Aqua, don't be so selfish.

464
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,601
There will never be enough people

465
00:20:16,602 --> 00:20:17,799
who can cast healing spells.

466
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,403
Look at Megumin, she's full of enthusiasm.

467
00:20:20,404 --> 00:20:23,597
Darkness, I'm going there first.

468
00:20:24,103 --> 00:20:25,306
Once the battle begins,

469
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,502
it will become a melee involving people,

470
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:29,679
and I will be unable to use my magic.

471
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,908
I'm going to take the top spot.

472
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:34,299
To be more specific, I will defeat
the opposition in one fell swoop

473
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,310
using my power-enhanced magic.

474
00:20:36,899 --> 00:20:37,696
Wait, Megumin.

475
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:38,696
Don't talk nonsense.

476
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,799
Aqua, stop being so contrary.

477
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,903
Geez.

478
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:44,502
Kazuma, please think of a solution!

479
00:20:44,503 --> 00:20:46,804
How long are they going to be loud?

480
00:20:46,805 --> 00:20:48,315
It is not worth the risk

481
00:20:48,316 --> 00:20:49,998
to fight in this kind of battle.

482
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:53,210
No, wait a minute.

483
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,992
Making my presence known now

484
00:20:56,993 --> 00:20:59,601
could help me live in the city again.

485
00:20:59,602 --> 00:21:00,903
Also,

486
00:21:00,904 --> 00:21:03,513
there are a lot of adventurers in
the royal capital who can cheat,

487
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,613
so I do not see how we could lose.

488
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:08,487
Also, we do not have to be unbeatable

489
00:21:08,488 --> 00:21:10,898
when we face the Devil King's Army.

490
00:21:10,899 --> 00:21:13,107
It would be enough for me to

491
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:15,106
just get a little attention.

492
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,775
Don't be like that, Darkness.

493
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,106
I have a bad feeling.

494
00:21:19,107 --> 00:21:20,403
It's a goddess's intuition.

495
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,356
I'll share a sausage
with you for breakfast.

496
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:23,997
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

497
00:21:23,998 --> 00:21:26,783
When the royal army
gets to the battlefield,

498
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,804
they will see the Devil King's Army
completely destroyed

499
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:31,706
and the calm magicians leaving the scene.

500
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,101
This is what I want to do.

501
00:21:34,102 --> 00:21:35,591
Now is a good opportunity.

502
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:36,804
Let me go!

503
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:38,804
Kazuma, I can't handle this!

504
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:40,904
Please control them!

505
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,507
The country is having a hard time.

506
00:21:44,508 --> 00:21:46,393
What are you still doing here?

507
00:21:48,201 --> 00:21:49,807
Okay, let's go.

508
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,399
Now is the time for us to take the stage.

509
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:58,201
No!

510
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,108
(Episode 5: A Bad Friend for The Princess)

511
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,612
Strike!

512
00:23:32,613 --> 00:23:34,399
Strike!

513
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,502
Hello, today is also a good day.

514
00:23:36,503 --> 00:23:37,403
I am Beldia.

515
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,077
Let me tell you, no matter how I call…
