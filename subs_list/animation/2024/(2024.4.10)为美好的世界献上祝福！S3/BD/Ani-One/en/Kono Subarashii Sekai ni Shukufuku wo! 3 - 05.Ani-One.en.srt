1
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:06,603
Devil King's Army attack alert.

2
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:08,208
Devil King's Army attack alert.

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:10,593
This is a large-scale attack.

4
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:12,953
All adventurers in the royal capital,

5
00:00:12,953 --> 00:00:15,713
please go to the battlefield.

6
00:00:34,693 --> 00:00:39,198
(Konosuba Season 3)

7
00:01:50,995 --> 00:01:53,593
(Episode 5: A Bad Friend for The Princess)

8
00:01:53,594 --> 00:01:55,495
Protect the royal capital!

9
00:01:55,496 --> 00:01:58,094
The Devil King's Army is nothing to fear.

10
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,802
Are you Mr. Satou Kazuma?

11
00:02:02,495 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,505
People below level 30…

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,213
It doesn't matter.

14
00:02:08,214 --> 00:02:11,000
That man has many achievements.

15
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:12,597
Claire.

16
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:13,598
I've heard of him.

17
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,901
He's the one who destroyed that Destroyer.

18
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,494
I heard that in Arcanletia,

19
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:20,698
he defeated the Deadly Poison Slime, Hans.

20
00:02:20,698 --> 00:02:22,489
After all, he is the hero of Axel,

21
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,912
Satou Kazuma.

22
00:02:23,913 --> 00:02:31,103
Kazuma…

23
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:32,797
Everyone, calm down.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,287
I'm just about to become a legend.

25
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:47,005
Leave it to me, I'll do my best.

26
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,901
Mr. Kazuma.

27
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:52,713
Smart as I am, I've learned my lesson.

28
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,891
Something is sure to go wrong in the end.

29
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:55,703
For example,

30
00:02:55,704 --> 00:02:58,297
someone with a screw loose
will use Explosion

31
00:02:58,297 --> 00:02:59,203
and drag me into trouble.

32
00:02:59,203 --> 00:03:01,010
Or someone with a muscle for a brain
will summon monsters

33
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,608
and drag me into trouble too.

34
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:04,301
Who's the one with a screw loose?

35
00:03:04,302 --> 00:03:05,322
You tell me.

36
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:07,604
Don't you dare say
I have a muscle for a brain!

37
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,911
I want to go back to Axel.

38
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:14,417
The enemies are just small fries
who win by numbers.

39
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,906
I will show them my true abilities.

40
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:24,099
Then let's go.

41
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,917
Devil King's Army subjugation team,
on the move.

42
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:29,562
(Konosuba)

43
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:41,203
Long time no see, Lady Eris.

44
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,291
That's not it!

45
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:04,604
Lady Eris, that's not it!

46
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:07,199
That's right, it went well until halfway.

47
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,568
Mr. Kazuma!

48
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:13,693
Snipe.

49
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,507
What are you doing?

50
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,797
You're a goddess, aren't you?

51
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:21,739
How can you be defeated by a lowly Kobold?

52
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,099
How?

53
00:04:25,802 --> 00:04:29,401
I'll make them regret
for insulting a Goddess.

54
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,604
Tremble under the wrath of the deities.

55
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,412
Divine Light Fist.

56
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,604
God Requiem!

57
00:04:37,605 --> 00:04:38,791
-It seems I need not worry about her.
-God Requiem!

58
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,198
Kachoufugetsu.

59
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,100
God Requiem.

60
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,600
A Kobold.

61
00:04:44,302 --> 00:04:47,411
For me, who has fought Leaders
of Devil King's Army multiple times,

62
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,001
you are simply not a match.

63
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:51,797
Stop right there!

64
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:56,870
The Devil King's Army
that endangers peace,

65
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,901
turn into the rust
on my sword Chunchumaru…

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,708
What now? This is so embarrassing.

67
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:12,714
Looking smug before the battle,

68
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:15,647
only to be killed by Kobolds.

69
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:19,495
Even Lady Eris was left speechless.

70
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,292
You must not sexually harass others.

71
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:27,495
The other day, to my follower…

72
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:33,307
Lady Eris, you can see
what happened on the ground.

73
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:34,401
That's why…

74
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:37,203
No, that was unavoidable.

75
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:38,797
When I caught her,

76
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:41,364
her chest felt flat,
so I thought she was a man.

77
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,406
That's what happened.

78
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:47,995
I'm sorry!

79
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:49,807
I won't make any more excuses!

80
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:53,297
Fine.

81
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:56,109
I won't forgive you next time.

82
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,006
Thank you.

83
00:05:58,599 --> 00:05:59,604
Oh dear.

84
00:05:59,605 --> 00:06:01,306
I was just thinking what I should do

85
00:06:01,307 --> 00:06:04,109
if a precious classic female character
like Lady Eris dislikes me.

86
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:05,797
You are flattering me.

87
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,297
Haven't you recently been overjoyed

88
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:10,115
by getting a new sister?

89
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:12,604
You…

90
00:06:13,205 --> 00:06:14,588
Just how much have you seen?

91
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:15,396
Lady Eris.

92
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:23,396
I'll stop teasing you.

93
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,198
Actually, I have a favor to ask of you.

94
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,199
A favor?

95
00:06:29,411 --> 00:06:32,104
It's a task for which
you won't be rewarded,

96
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:34,495
nor will you gain any fame from it.

97
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:40,693
It's something I can only entrust
to someone I deem reliable.

98
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:45,120
Could you help retrieve
the sacred treasure?

99
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,411
Mr. Kazuma, who was killed by the Kobolds,

100
00:06:54,412 --> 00:06:55,709
welcome back.

101
00:06:56,193 --> 00:06:57,500
Hey.

102
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,203
Don't say that to someone
who has just been resurrected.

103
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,593
Let's finish the remaining
Devil King's Army.

104
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:04,312
Those who can still move, follow me.

105
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:06,178
Yes.

106
00:07:08,198 --> 00:07:09,411
What should we do?

107
00:07:09,412 --> 00:07:11,402
Things have become tricky.

108
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:14,297
This Useless Goddess

109
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:15,309
doesn't seem to know

110
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,995
where the sacred treasure
she bestowed to the reincarnated is.

111
00:07:19,202 --> 00:07:21,098
The first one doesn't require a price

112
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:24,193
and can summon monsters at random.

113
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,615
But controlling the monsters has a price.

114
00:07:28,703 --> 00:07:32,103
The other one allows body swapping.

115
00:07:32,104 --> 00:07:35,010
This thing has a time limit for its use.

116
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,109
It is said that these two items

117
00:07:37,109 --> 00:07:39,010
can have a great impact on the world

118
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,802
even if used by someone
other than the reincarnated.

119
00:07:43,802 --> 00:07:45,609
I want to go home.

120
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,402
Kazuma, have you been resurrected?

121
00:07:48,403 --> 00:07:49,704
Yes.

122
00:07:49,705 --> 00:07:51,417
How do you feel?

123
00:07:51,417 --> 00:07:52,698
Your performance just now

124
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:54,115
touched me greatly!

125
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:55,892
Thinking of how you
resisted powerful magic

126
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,098
and charged into the Devil King's Army,

127
00:07:58,099 --> 00:07:59,130
I just…

128
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,703
Bring it on!

129
00:08:02,193 --> 00:08:05,104
Their army commander
was frightened by you.

130
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:06,319
He looked shocked.

131
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,116
It was unforgettable.

132
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,509
No, I…

133
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,702
Ka… Kazuma,

134
00:08:11,703 --> 00:08:13,197
don't push yourself.

135
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,697
Rest well!

136
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:16,401
Okay.

137
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:17,705
Make way.

138
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,998
The biggest hero is coming through.

139
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,604
Clear a path.

140
00:08:23,792 --> 00:08:25,411
Miss Megumin is tired.

141
00:08:25,412 --> 00:08:28,193
Wanna get blown away by Explosion?

142
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:31,000
The top magician in Axel,

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,901
the one who turns everything to ashes,

144
00:08:32,901 --> 00:08:35,005
Miss Megumin is passing through!

145
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:37,285
What's that all about?

146
00:08:37,286 --> 00:08:39,104
It was exhilarating.

147
00:08:39,105 --> 00:08:40,005
Whenever the enemy commander

148
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:41,505
is in crisis,

149
00:08:41,506 --> 00:08:43,895
he always says
that this is just the vanguard.

150
00:08:43,896 --> 00:08:45,901
Next time, he will lead
an army many times larger

151
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:48,297
and turn the royal capital to ashes.

152
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:49,598
Trying to threaten us.

153
00:08:49,599 --> 00:08:50,693
Just when he said that…

154
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:53,617
Explosion!

155
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:01,203
I am Megumin,

156
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:03,817
the top magician in Axel

157
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:06,308
who controls explosion magic.

158
00:09:07,098 --> 00:09:11,411
You're the ones who will turn to ashes.

159
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:13,896
Yet you countered him.

160
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:18,892
And cast that grand spell
with all your power.

161
00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:21,312
Right?

162
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:23,400
Facing my fatal spell,

163
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:25,812
no one can survive.

164
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:29,687
After all, even that Destroyer
was annihilated.

165
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:32,004
Even that Destroyer?

166
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,301
What a great Arch Wizard.

167
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:35,203
Miss Megumin.

168
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:38,187
Please show us other advanced magic.

169
00:09:38,999 --> 00:09:40,510
I want to see too.

170
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:43,692
I do want to show you,

171
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:45,808
but my magic power is depleted now.

172
00:09:46,403 --> 00:09:47,401
Pity.

173
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:49,104
No matter, you can show us tomorrow.

174
00:09:49,105 --> 00:09:49,839
Miss Megumin.

175
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,593
I'm looking forward to tomorrow.

176
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:54,093
I'll tell the others.

177
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:58,198
Tomorrow… uh…

178
00:09:58,198 --> 00:09:59,390
Kazuma!

179
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,600
You've successfully revived?

180
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,911
You must have some trouble adjusting.

181
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:06,009
I'll take care of you tomorrow.

182
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,848
(Konosuba)
Kazuma!

183
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:20,099
Didn't you say you'd take care of me?

184
00:10:20,099 --> 00:10:21,010
Kazuma.

185
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,000
Let's return to Axel tomorrow.

186
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:23,864
Early in the morning.

187
00:10:27,906 --> 00:10:29,911
Elder brother, I am glad you are safe.

188
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:31,093
Elder brother?

189
00:10:31,094 --> 00:10:32,593
Ye… yeah.

190
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:34,802
Not exactly safe though.

191
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,599
Since I died and then came back to life.

192
00:10:37,598 --> 00:10:39,098
Are you alright?

193
00:10:39,099 --> 00:10:40,181
Before the victory celebration,

194
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,510
you should take some rest.

195
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,088
Your room has been kept
just as it was, elder brother.

196
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:45,604
'Elder brother' again?

197
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:53,109
This room is really nice.

198
00:10:53,809 --> 00:10:56,801
I can understand why you
didn't want to go back.

199
00:10:56,802 --> 00:10:58,197
Right?

200
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:00,401
The food is delicious,
and people respect me.

201
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:01,828
If you lived here,

202
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,807
you wouldn't want to go back either.

203
00:11:04,893 --> 00:11:08,193
But I haven't been very active.

204
00:11:08,194 --> 00:11:10,193
Back to Axel tomorrow?

205
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,999
Although I like showing off

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,716
in the royal capital…

207
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:20,312
I still prefer

208
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,806
the four of us in Axel

209
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,703
completing missions together.

210
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,068
It was a lively life,
even if we quarreled.

211
00:11:30,302 --> 00:11:32,603
Well… that's true.

212
00:11:32,604 --> 00:11:35,197
But too lively can also be a problem.

213
00:11:39,187 --> 00:11:40,286
Elder brother,

214
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:42,890
I am very sorry.

215
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:43,911
I pleaded with Claire

216
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,698
to let you stay in the city, but…

217
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:49,104
There's no helping it.

218
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,708
I'm sorry I couldn't be of help.

219
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,807
You need not apologize.

220
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,010
Because you literally

221
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,807
fought with your life on the line.

222
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:04,957
Sorry.

223
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,204
Your brother was besieged by Kobolds,

224
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:10,702
You two.

225
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:12,604
Have you forgotten that I'm here too?

226
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:13,900
We haven't forgotten!

227
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,213
Iris is right.

228
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:16,922
How could we possibly forget?

229
00:12:17,807 --> 00:12:18,490
Ah.

230
00:12:21,391 --> 00:12:23,495
I didn't notice before.

231
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:25,604
You're wearing a powerful magical item.

232
00:12:26,511 --> 00:12:30,499
I can feel immense magic
from that necklace.

233
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,604
Someone offered this to my brother Jadice.

234
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:36,603
In place of him, who is on an expedition,

235
00:12:36,604 --> 00:12:38,208
it's in my safekeeping.

236
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,005
What kind of power does it have?

237
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:44,093
Can it destroy the world?

238
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:45,412
No, well…

239
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:49,268
We still haven't figured out
how to use it.

240
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,483
You are flaunting your interest.

241
00:12:51,484 --> 00:12:54,198
There's a script etched on this.

242
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:58,403
But the scholars in town
couldn't decipher it.

243
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,698
Isn't this Japanese?

244
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,406
Let me see.

245
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,704
What's yours is mine.

246
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:06,797
What's mine is yours.

247
00:13:06,797 --> 00:13:08,807
Let me become you.

248
00:13:08,807 --> 00:13:10,103
Is this an insult?

249
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:12,005
You can understand this?

250
00:13:13,005 --> 00:13:14,293
This is called Japanese…

251
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,306
Hey, the necklace is glowing!

252
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:19,020
Iris, throw it away!

253
00:13:19,021 --> 00:13:22,313
Throw it out of the window!

254
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:27,318
Eh?

255
00:13:27,319 --> 00:13:29,193
Nothing happened.

256
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:32,917
I thought something would happen

257
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,594
and impact the whole world.

258
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:36,412
It's disappointing.

259
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,103
How long are you going
to stare at each other?

260
00:13:40,104 --> 00:13:41,005
Just like before.

261
00:13:41,005 --> 00:13:43,510
Don't forget that I'm here too.

262
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,698
No, Megumin.

263
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,994
Something shocking has indeed happened.

264
00:13:46,995 --> 00:13:48,245
Calling me by my name?

265
00:13:48,598 --> 00:13:49,692
Listen,

266
00:13:49,693 --> 00:13:51,812
I am older than you.

267
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:52,910
You should call me Sister Megumin.

268
00:13:52,911 --> 00:13:54,708
Well…

269
00:13:59,896 --> 00:14:02,505
I am Iris, actually.

270
00:14:07,508 --> 00:14:10,698
Alright, what should we do next?

271
00:14:11,386 --> 00:14:12,269
Personally, I'm willing

272
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,604
to live on as a beautiful girl.

273
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,148
But it's also hard to separate

274
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,390
with my old body.

275
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,614
Why are you so calm?

276
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:22,704
You just casually said
something astonishing.

277
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:26,907
Men are really strong.

278
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,407
I want to go on an adventure
just like this.

279
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:31,797
I'm sorry.

280
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:33,917
Speaking like this with that face…

281
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,500
It's really a headache.

282
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,708
Repeating the script
failed to switch us back.

283
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,198
It can swap bodies.

284
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:45,672
Such a powerful magical item
is unprecedented.

285
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,490
A magical item, huh.

286
00:14:49,085 --> 00:14:50,494
If it's some sort of curse,

287
00:14:50,495 --> 00:14:52,005
we just have to ask Aqua…

288
00:14:52,912 --> 00:14:56,312
The other one allows body swapping.

289
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,001
This thing has a time limit for its use.

290
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:03,562
This is it!

291
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,495
Don't worry.

292
00:15:06,496 --> 00:15:08,500
I know what this magical item is.

293
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:10,906
This thing has a time limit.

294
00:15:10,906 --> 00:15:12,796
We'll be able to swap back.

295
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:14,910
Really?

296
00:15:14,911 --> 00:15:17,401
I got the information
from the most reliable source.

297
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:18,416
Don't worry.

298
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:21,697
Bro… Brother…

299
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:23,412
What is it?

300
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,406
Iris, you're in the midst of puberty.

301
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:34,099
Don't play with my body, okay?

302
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,146
I… I wouldn't do that.

303
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:39,697
I…

304
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:41,398
Just this once.

305
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,167
I want to go outside the city
without my retainers.

306
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,104
Outside the city?

307
00:15:46,105 --> 00:15:47,109
Yes.

308
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:50,088
It's possible
with your current appearance.

309
00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:52,417
But just you alone…

310
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,599
Can't I?

311
00:15:58,306 --> 00:15:59,797
I'll accompany her.

312
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:00,906
Megumin?

313
00:16:02,096 --> 00:16:05,599
I can't follow Kazuma,
who is now the princess.

314
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,203
I won't be as meddlesome
as those retainers.

315
00:16:09,203 --> 00:16:11,807
Really, Sister Megumin?

316
00:16:12,997 --> 00:16:15,208
I did ask you to call me that,

317
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,453
but you can stick with Megumin.

318
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:20,687
Miss Megumin, thank you.

319
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,093
Leave it to me.

320
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:23,806
From how to bargain when shopping

321
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,609
to how to deal with others' provocations,

322
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,463
I will teach you all sorts of things.

323
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:30,406
Is it really okay?

324
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,958
Yay!

325
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,453
Konosuba.

326
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,406
Oh no, this is addictive.

327
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:52,010
Princess Iris.

328
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,088
Did that man

329
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:55,209
teach you bad things again?

330
00:16:55,994 --> 00:16:59,703
Claire, Mr. Kazuma is
an outstanding person.

331
00:16:59,704 --> 00:17:02,614
His name could be in a history textbook.

332
00:17:02,615 --> 00:17:05,360
Did he really impart something to you?

333
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:09,407
It's better to get rid of him.

334
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:13,604
Please don't have such frightening
thoughts right behind him.

335
00:17:14,502 --> 00:17:15,813
Princess Iris.

336
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:18,094
Mr. Mitsurugi.

337
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:23,001
I've heard that you've again
had a great performance.

338
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:23,930
Not at all.

339
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,401
It's nothing remarkable.

340
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:32,214
So you can look like that too.

341
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,513
Because I consider protecting the citizens

342
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,505
and Princess Iris as my mission.

343
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:41,000
Claire.

344
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:44,105
Execute this man
who dares to touch my head.

345
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:45,208
What?

346
00:17:45,794 --> 00:17:47,896
You've been weird since earlier.

347
00:17:47,897 --> 00:17:49,303
What happened?

348
00:17:49,712 --> 00:17:50,775
I'll forgive your disrespect

349
00:17:50,776 --> 00:17:53,599
on account of Claire.

350
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,197
Now get lost.

351
00:17:55,198 --> 00:17:56,906
Scram now.

352
00:17:56,906 --> 00:17:57,807
Go away.

353
00:17:58,412 --> 00:18:01,297
My…my apologies.

354
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:03,598
Heck.

355
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:05,411
I'm not strolling through the castle

356
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:06,995
to see you.

357
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:09,004
Right, Claire.

358
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:10,051
Yes.

359
00:18:10,052 --> 00:18:11,801
Where is Lalatina?

360
00:18:11,802 --> 00:18:13,208
I want to tease her…

361
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,593
She has worked hard in this battle.

362
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:20,081
I want to reward her.

363
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:22,301
Lord Dustiness got covered in ash

364
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:24,010
in the battle.

365
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,505
She is taking a bath.

366
00:18:27,104 --> 00:18:28,807
Take me there immediately!

367
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:31,588
I want to join in and wash her back!

368
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:34,610
How can royalty wash a retainer's back?

369
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:37,603
I want to wash your back too.

370
00:18:37,604 --> 00:18:39,911
Thank you for your hard work.

371
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:41,895
Could it be

372
00:18:42,595 --> 00:18:43,823
you don't like it?

373
00:18:44,805 --> 00:18:46,412
How could I not like it?

374
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:48,104
Come on, Princess Iris.

375
00:18:48,104 --> 00:18:48,911
Let's go.

376
00:18:48,912 --> 00:18:50,306
Let's go right now.

377
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:53,104
It's the highest honor.

378
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:54,797
Come, come.

379
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,306
Eh?

380
00:18:57,307 --> 00:18:59,805
This lady's gaze upon Iris is…

381
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:02,598
Is she from that side?

382
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,203
I thought she was serious and strict.

383
00:19:04,203 --> 00:19:06,307
She is from over there?

384
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:08,708
Is there no decent female character
in this world?

385
00:19:10,078 --> 00:19:12,391
But it suits me fine.

386
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:16,011
Konosuba.

387
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:18,693
Princess Iris.

388
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:21,209
Are you taking a bath before the banquet?

389
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:24,703
Princess Iris?

390
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:32,797
I want to wash Lalatina's back,
she fought hard in the battle.

391
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,698
But it seems I'm late.

392
00:19:39,198 --> 00:19:40,513
What a pity.

393
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:44,598
Princess Iris's kindness cannot be wasted.

394
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,203
I'll wash it again.

395
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:49,104
Undressing in front of me?

396
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,197
She's too careless.

397
00:19:51,198 --> 00:19:52,691
I'm not mentally prepared.

398
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,600
Calm down.

399
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:55,494
Calm down, Satou Kazuma.

400
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,604
Darkness and you
have bathed together before.

401
00:19:57,604 --> 00:19:59,896
What's wrong?

402
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,993
Your face is so red.

403
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,729
She smells good.

404
00:20:05,735 --> 00:20:09,088
No, that's not the point.

405
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:10,588
If I have the scent of soap on me,

406
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:13,278
Iris will find out that I took a bath.

407
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,863
Oh my gosh!

408
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:17,699
It's such a tempting scene.

409
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,599
Endure.

410
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:19,801
I must endure.

411
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,807
If she discovered…

412
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:23,511
Are you feeling unwell?

413
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,401
Something has been off since a while ago.

414
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,214
I understand

415
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:37,516
why the reincarnated would
want this sacred treasure.

416
00:20:39,307 --> 00:20:41,510
Whatever.

417
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,806
So what if Iris finds out I took a bath

418
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:46,005
because of the soap's scent?

419
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,099
The great ancestors of Japan

420
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:56,417
left us with this saying,

421
00:20:58,105 --> 00:21:02,406
'Leave tomorrow's matters to tomorrow.'

422
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,626
The goddess of fortune, Lady Eris,

423
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,104
I am now wholeheartedly grateful

424
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,302
for my good luck.

425
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:22,900
Asking for a beating, brat?

426
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:24,828
Are you prepared for the consequences?

427
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:27,593
Look, big brother is all disheartened.

428
00:21:27,594 --> 00:21:29,692
I… I'm not disheartened at all.

429
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:33,306
It's just the first time
I've been insulted so harshly.

430
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:36,294
That's right, you've said it well.

431
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,307
Crush them with your next sentence.

432
00:21:38,308 --> 00:21:39,807
From the moment
you strutted with your lackeys,

433
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:41,426
you were destined to be a nobody,

434
00:21:41,427 --> 00:21:43,009
an overwhelmingly insignificant nobody,

435
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:46,005
a waste that can't even
contribute to others' points.

436
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:52,297
How dare you look down on me!

437
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,006
(Episode 6: Farewell to the Good Life)

438
00:23:31,007 --> 00:23:32,504
Welcome.

439
00:23:32,505 --> 00:23:34,909
Three bowls of Slime Red Bean Soup left.

440
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,708
Hello, I'm Hans.

441
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,209
May I have a word?

442
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,209
Sometimes I wonder…
