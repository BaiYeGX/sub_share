1
00:00:03,594 --> 00:00:06,802
Princess Iris, I have already done
what needs to be done.

2
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,401
Mr. Kazuma will now be
officially considered a guest…

3
00:00:10,402 --> 00:00:11,103
Darkness then

4
00:00:11,104 --> 00:00:13,505
clenched the towel tightly
while being completely naked

5
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:14,699
and showing a shy face…

6
00:00:15,197 --> 00:00:16,687
Sh-Showing a shy face?

7
00:00:16,688 --> 00:00:17,198
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:19,609
After she put on a shy face,
what happened?

9
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:21,407
Damn!

10
00:00:21,407 --> 00:00:23,308
What the heck are you talking
about with Princess Iris?

11
00:00:23,308 --> 00:00:24,996
Wanna die?

12
00:00:24,997 --> 00:00:27,307
Iris asked me to tell the story.

13
00:00:27,308 --> 00:00:29,098
How dare you address her by her name?

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,500
Address her as Your Highness.

15
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,907
This guy is such a nuisance.

16
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:34,199
I allowed Mr. Kazuma

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,801
to call me by my name.

18
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:38,500
Princess Iris.

19
00:00:40,198 --> 00:00:41,572
Instead,

20
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:44,093
what did Lalatina do
as she clenched the towel tightly?

21
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:45,312
No way!

22
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:47,303
It is inappropriate for you
to hear about this!

23
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:50,208
Mr. Kazuma,

24
00:00:50,596 --> 00:00:54,006
please do not talk about
these things with Princess Iris.

25
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:56,500
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:57,504 --> 00:00:59,313
She was very forthcoming at the castle.

27
00:01:01,408 --> 00:01:03,500
No choice, then…

28
00:01:04,104 --> 00:01:05,692
I will just tell you how I won
the deal I made with Darkness,

29
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:08,604
in which the loser had to suffer.

30
00:01:08,605 --> 00:01:09,901
Tell me.

31
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:11,098
Please tell me.

32
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:12,703
No way, Princess Iris!

33
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,197
That man is talking nonsense!

34
00:01:14,198 --> 00:01:16,500
This guy is a total loser!

35
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:35,199
(Konosuba Season 3)

36
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:48,104
(Episode 3: Re-Educate this Arrogant Girl)

37
00:02:48,105 --> 00:02:49,006
Then, next…

38
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:52,396
It is the way to handle
being sucked up by a gigantic toad.

39
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,699
-Firstly, what needs to be noted is…
-Let me sort out the current situation.

40
00:02:57,204 --> 00:02:59,407
W-Welcome, Mr. Kazuma.

41
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:02,198
Please make yourself at home here.

42
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:03,412
Have a good rest.

43
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,895
This is your room, Mr. Kazuma.

44
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:13,094
Ex-Excuse me…

45
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:14,401
Lady?

46
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:17,194
My name is Rain.

47
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,104
Miss Rain, this is a kidnapping, isn't it?

48
00:03:20,808 --> 00:03:23,000
We invited you as a guest,

49
00:03:23,001 --> 00:03:24,296
this is not a kidnapping.

50
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,698
No, this is clearly a kidnapping.

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,099
Usually, Princess Iris is
very obedient and behaves well,

52
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:31,906
but she acted this way.

53
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:35,401
Please forgive her first rash move

54
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:38,298
and play with her for a while.

55
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:40,808
No matter what you say…

56
00:03:51,094 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:55,676
Lalatina seems to be very happy.

58
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:57,693
I am envious,

59
00:03:57,693 --> 00:03:59,488
so could you please spend

60
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,703
a few short days with me as well?

61
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:03,406
That's what Her Highness said.

62
00:04:05,607 --> 00:04:06,996
She's quite cute, isn't it?

63
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:10,302
Alright then.

64
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:11,912
Miss Rain.

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,568
Tell my friends

66
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:15,610
that I will be staying here
for a short time.

67
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:23,803
It sounds fun to have school festivals.

68
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,204
I can't believe it's run by people my age.

69
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:29,808
But

70
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:33,813
-could it really make enough to pay everyone?
-It surprised me that she was interested in hearing about school life.

71
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:37,302
The princess appears to be very envious

72
00:04:37,303 --> 00:04:39,808
of the days that I found extremely dull.

73
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,609
Why not just open a school
if you love it so much?

74
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,802
Devil King's Army alert!

75
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:50,001
Devil King's Army alert!

76
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:52,401
Knights are required
to depart immediately!

77
00:04:52,402 --> 00:04:54,197
-We are in need of the assistance of high-level adventurers.
-Again?

78
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:55,813
We are in need of the assistance
of high-level adventurers.

79
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,297
That is the case here.

80
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:03,407
It is really impossible
to concentrate on education.

81
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:10,308
Indeed,

82
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,703
everyone has a hard time in this world

83
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,412
due to that Devil King.

84
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:18,594
The Devil King's Army's raids
have been thwarted.

85
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:22,500
Adventurers who came
to our aid will be rewarded.

86
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,397
Kindly retrieve it from the guild counter.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,703
It was the capital of the kingdom,
yet it was raided.

88
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,495
This nation is in utter chaos.

89
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:32,289
I really hope that the Japanese people

90
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:34,104
who are capable of cheating
will help up a little.

91
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:36,006
Thanks for

92
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:39,906
telling me fun stories today.

93
00:05:40,396 --> 00:05:41,594
Please ask Rain to teleport you

94
00:05:41,594 --> 00:05:43,808
back to Axel tomorrow.

95
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:47,506
Because staying here is not very safe.

96
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:50,505
That's true.

97
00:05:51,704 --> 00:05:55,099
There is nothing I can do to
protect this place, even if I stay.

98
00:05:56,698 --> 00:05:57,808
I know those who remained in Axel

99
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:00,911
-are concerned about me,
-Kazuma.

100
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:02,709
-despite all that has transpired.
-Kazuma.

101
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,813
It makes me a little sad to leave,

102
00:06:06,813 --> 00:06:07,783
but I shall go back.

103
00:06:09,806 --> 00:06:13,204
Do you mind if I ask you to tell me
adventure stories again?

104
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,209
Of course not.

105
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:17,302
I will come back for you, Iris.

106
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:23,099
I always feel you resemble
my older brother.

107
00:06:24,006 --> 00:06:28,110
I no longer have casual conversations
with my own brother like this.

108
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,599
I really want you to stay,

109
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:33,709
but I can't be stubborn any longer.

110
00:06:34,101 --> 00:06:35,006
What did you just say?

111
00:06:36,303 --> 00:06:37,412
Um…

112
00:06:38,407 --> 00:06:41,312
I really want you to stay.

113
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:42,995
No, not this.

114
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:45,912
What did you say I resembled before that?

115
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:50,104
Um… You resemble my older brother.

116
00:06:50,105 --> 00:06:51,813
Could you please say that again?

117
00:06:53,308 --> 00:06:55,193
You resemble my older brother.

118
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:56,094
Say it again.

119
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:58,099
If possible, say it more affectionately.

120
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,313
You're a bit like my brother.

121
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:10,703
I am staying in this castle!

122
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:34,006
How may I be of assistance, Mr. Kazuma?

123
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:37,406
I would like a cup of coffee, Sebastian.

124
00:07:37,407 --> 00:07:38,693
My name is Heidel.

125
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:40,412
Please, Heidel.

126
00:07:40,891 --> 00:07:43,110
Um, I'll make the bed.

127
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:46,110
Don't mind me, Mary.

128
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:48,209
Yes, sir.

129
00:07:55,803 --> 00:07:57,602
Good morning.

130
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,312
Brother.

131
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:02,703
This is so nice.

132
00:08:02,704 --> 00:08:05,001
How sweet that you refer
to me as a brother!

133
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:12,704
Good morning, Iris.

134
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:16,506
Please put on your pants.

135
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:18,339
(Konosuba)
Huh?

136
00:08:19,895 --> 00:08:20,699
That's not it!

137
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,197
That's not it, Iris!

138
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:24,703
I'm not a pervert!

139
00:08:24,704 --> 00:08:26,203
Yeah, yeah.

140
00:08:26,204 --> 00:08:28,506
Please put on your pants, elder brother.

141
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:30,401
Call me brother!

142
00:08:30,402 --> 00:08:32,798
It breaks my heart that you seem to be
intentionally putting distance between us!

143
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:34,513
Iris!

144
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,598
Iris!

145
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:40,808
Iris no longer calls me brother.

146
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:45,610
After that,

147
00:08:46,697 --> 00:08:48,199
I play tag

148
00:08:49,193 --> 00:08:50,612
and hide-and-seek with Iris

149
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:55,996
and sometimes interrupt her lessons.

150
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:59,704
So, to sum it up, I am her daily playmate.

151
00:09:02,593 --> 00:09:06,292
I want you to play this game
with me today.

152
00:09:09,506 --> 00:09:10,901
There is just that she looks

153
00:09:10,902 --> 00:09:12,808
worried sometimes.

154
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,906
Perhaps it is because, as Rain mentioned,

155
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:17,600
she is usually a very well-behaved child.

156
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:19,907
Iris has to know full well

157
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:22,302
that her spoiled brat words

158
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:26,095
baffle those around her.

159
00:09:28,598 --> 00:09:30,510
If we play, I will compete seriously,

160
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:32,195
so I will not hold back to
be nice to my opponent.

161
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,912
Do you still want to play
even if that happens?

162
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:36,600
Yes.

163
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:39,494
Please take our game very seriously.

164
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,808
Okay, but do not weep if you lose.

165
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,501
Since we are going to play seriously,

166
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,803
we must exchange greetings
before the game begins.

167
00:09:47,602 --> 00:09:48,902
Good game.

168
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:51,198
Good game.

169
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,302
Um…

170
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:57,412
Let's call it a day.

171
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,907
Are you going to run after you win?

172
00:09:59,907 --> 00:10:01,697
You should do your best
if we are competing!

173
00:10:01,698 --> 00:10:03,802
Do not hold back simply
because you do not want to compete!

174
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:06,395
I can tell even if you try to lose!

175
00:10:06,396 --> 00:10:08,807
It is awkward to say this
because I invited you to play with me,

176
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,600
(Konosuba)
but you are a real pain to deal with, elder brother!

177
00:10:14,604 --> 00:10:16,199
I won!

178
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:19,398
Man. Elder brother,
you're just like a child.

179
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,002
Even though you lost,
you are still so cocky.

180
00:10:22,601 --> 00:10:25,403
Okay, here is this
bamboo dragonfly for you.

181
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:27,710
Thank you.

182
00:10:33,011 --> 00:10:35,387
Next time, let us take it outside to play.

183
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,705
You should get out more.

184
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:42,402
In this world,

185
00:10:42,403 --> 00:10:45,507
there may be demons
that people find strange

186
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:49,403
and liches that eat nothing
but bread crusts.

187
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:53,199
You can't trick me just
because I don't go outside very often.

188
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,007
How could there be such demons and liches?

189
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,710
Besides…

190
00:10:59,705 --> 00:11:01,809
A band of knights will form an escort

191
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:05,507
as soon as I step outside.

192
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:15,606
Konosuba.

193
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:34,111
How may I be of assistance, Mr. Kazuma?

194
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:37,699
I would like a cup of coffee, Sebastian.

195
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,906
My name is Heidel.

196
00:11:39,401 --> 00:11:40,507
Please, Heidel.

197
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:47,611
A week has passed already, huh?

198
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:49,403
Alright.

199
00:11:49,404 --> 00:11:52,512
Mary is coming to change the sheets soon.

200
00:11:53,107 --> 00:11:54,212
As a noble,

201
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,315
how should I stand in her way today?

202
00:11:58,513 --> 00:11:59,513
Here she is.

203
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:05,694
Good morning, Mary.

204
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:10,512
Don't think I'll let you change
the sheets that easily.

205
00:12:11,001 --> 00:12:14,392
Say this quickly if you want to

206
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:16,397
change the sheets:

207
00:12:16,397 --> 00:12:18,004
"Master, please."

208
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,094
"Could you please let me help you…"

209
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:29,317
Please let me help you what?

210
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:31,411
Tell me, Kazuma.

211
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:34,802
Just say it out loud so everyone can hear

212
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:36,703
what you have to say next.

213
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:39,203
M-Master, could you please let me

214
00:12:39,596 --> 00:12:44,307
help you change the sheets that smell…

215
00:12:44,815 --> 00:12:47,098
Yeah, keep going.

216
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,796
What's the matter? Doesn't sexual
harassment come naturally to you?

217
00:12:49,797 --> 00:12:52,011
Stop being coy and tell me.

218
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:53,697
F-Forgive me.

219
00:12:53,698 --> 00:12:55,505
Why are you guys here?

220
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,098
We've come to take you back.

221
00:12:58,099 --> 00:12:59,902
Megumin can't sleep at night.

222
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:01,202
She's been worried about you.

223
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:02,604
Th-That was a coincidence.

224
00:13:02,604 --> 00:13:04,703
Don't get confused over such silly things.

225
00:13:04,704 --> 00:13:07,493
It is my job to play with Iris!

226
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,707
Do not get in the way of my peaceful life!

227
00:13:09,708 --> 00:13:12,999
That job does not exist
in this country, you idiot.

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,198
Kazuma, you are having
too much fun by yourself.

229
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:19,015
We all took out the leaders
of the Devil King's Army.

230
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,994
If I don't get to live in
the castle too, it is just unfair.

231
00:13:22,698 --> 00:13:24,191
Aqua, shut up!

232
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:25,593
You are only going to make things worse.

233
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,604
Um…

234
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:29,302
Princess Iris.

235
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,193
I overheard your conversation.

237
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:39,208
Despite being a hopeless case,

238
00:13:39,697 --> 00:13:43,510
he is a famous adventurer in Axel.

239
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:46,806
The people in that city care about him,

240
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:48,312
and he has friends there.

241
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,208
We also worry about him.

242
00:13:52,604 --> 00:13:56,114
Could you please let him go?

243
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,192
Iris, tell her quickly.

244
00:13:59,192 --> 00:14:03,202
"Brother is going to live in the castle
with me and play with me."

245
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:04,296
You're right.

246
00:14:04,297 --> 00:14:06,401
Sorry. I acted solely in my self-interest.

247
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,430
It's okay!

248
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,098
It's okay to do that, Iris!

249
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:12,900
You are the highest-ranking
person in the castle!

250
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:14,406
Tell her, quickly!

251
00:14:14,407 --> 00:14:15,796
Hurry up!

252
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:17,302
Lalatina.

253
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:20,010
Please let me host a dinner

254
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,104
for him tonight to say goodbye.

255
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,844
Konosuba.

256
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:33,996
Look, Kazuma.

257
00:14:33,997 --> 00:14:35,916
This is really yummy.

258
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,384
Natural wild melon with prosciutto!

259
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:40,786
It's still alive!

260
00:14:40,786 --> 00:14:42,598
This tastes great too.

261
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:46,099
It is pudding on vinegar rice
with mustard soy sauce on top!

262
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:48,802
Yeah, yeah. Great.

263
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:50,103
The pudding in my mouth…

264
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:51,807
You look lovely today, too.

265
00:14:52,693 --> 00:14:54,104
The moonlight blossom,

266
00:14:54,104 --> 00:14:57,603
which only appears once every hundred
years, can't hold a candle to your beauty.

267
00:14:57,604 --> 00:14:59,010
I agree.

268
00:14:59,011 --> 00:15:00,493
You flatter me.

269
00:15:00,494 --> 00:15:01,494
Oh, right.

270
00:15:01,494 --> 00:15:03,999
Lady Dustiness, do you have a fiancé?

271
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:06,695
If you don't have one yet…

272
00:15:06,696 --> 00:15:07,697
What are you talking about?

273
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:12,193
Since I always go on blind dates with her,
I should be her fiancé!

274
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:14,198
She has a lot of fans.

275
00:15:14,704 --> 00:15:16,104
What an impropriety!

276
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:20,005
I suppose Lady Dustiness
should have a better match.

277
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,896
Lord Aldarp.

278
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:25,801
Hey, what are you doing here?

279
00:15:25,802 --> 00:15:26,894
Shut up!

280
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:28,790
My house is still under reconstruction

281
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,304
because you sent the Destroyer

282
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:34,317
to my mansion!

283
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:35,604
So,

284
00:15:35,605 --> 00:15:38,118
who would be a better match
for Lady Dustiness?

285
00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:40,598
Are you still after Darkness, old man?

286
00:15:40,599 --> 00:15:42,406
Call me Lord Aldarp.

287
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:46,514
As it stands, only one person

288
00:15:46,515 --> 00:15:48,196
can truly complement Lady Dustiness.

289
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:52,598
That is the first prince, Prince Jatice,
who is in charge of the regular army

290
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,594
fighting the Devil King's Army right now.

291
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,497
Prince Jatice, who is the national hero,

292
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:02,192
and Lady Dustiness, who just beat
the leaders of the Devil King's army,

293
00:16:02,192 --> 00:16:04,213
are a great match.

294
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,448
Th-That makes sense.

295
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:10,500
A more outstanding match
than Prince Jatice…

296
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:18,301
Hey.

297
00:16:18,302 --> 00:16:20,505
What about your shitty
relationship with me?

298
00:16:20,505 --> 00:16:21,812
What the hell, Lalatina?

299
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:23,302
Do you want to abandon me?

300
00:16:24,302 --> 00:16:26,307
Wh-What made you say that out of the blue?

301
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:28,509
What about all the sweet times we had?

302
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,302
Not too long ago,
you still called me master…

303
00:16:32,994 --> 00:16:36,510
Pranks can get out of hand
if they go too far.

304
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:38,906
Are you sure of this, Lalatina?

305
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:41,301
People who want to date you will run away

306
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:42,802
if you use your natural
super-strength on me.

307
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:46,703
Gosh.

308
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:49,307
(Konosuba)
You are still a great actor, as usual.

309
00:16:52,703 --> 00:16:54,802
I am just a little naughty.

310
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:58,608
But when I see Darkness's worried face,

311
00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:00,505
I say strange things without realizing it.

312
00:17:02,004 --> 00:17:04,898
After all, isn't this my farewell party?

313
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:07,693
Why are they ignoring the protagonist?

314
00:17:08,098 --> 00:17:10,111
They are having a great time over there.

315
00:17:10,111 --> 00:17:12,905
The protagonist is obviously right here.

316
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,802
What are you doing here?

317
00:17:17,592 --> 00:17:18,598
Iris!

318
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:19,807
As expected of Iris!

319
00:17:20,203 --> 00:17:22,599
It is too much to handle
being alone at this party.

320
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,104
Iris, you really are a good sister.

321
00:17:25,105 --> 00:17:26,500
A-Am I?

322
00:17:28,004 --> 00:17:30,904
Next, a huge toad

323
00:17:30,905 --> 00:17:32,707
comes out of this glass.

324
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:35,011
Her passion as a performer
is rising again.

325
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:35,905
Look.

326
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:39,394
What do you think? This is…

327
00:17:43,394 --> 00:17:46,415
This castle will return to its usual
serene state beginning tomorrow.

328
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:48,900
Because the person who irritates Claire

329
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:52,504
and causes Rain trouble is leaving.

330
00:17:53,201 --> 00:17:54,514
Is not that good?

331
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,098
That being said,
what about someone like me do you like?

332
00:17:59,102 --> 00:18:01,412
I have never met anyone like you before.

333
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,504
Everyone loves and cherishes you,

334
00:18:04,004 --> 00:18:05,004
and you are brave,

335
00:18:05,395 --> 00:18:07,400
rude, and outspoken.

336
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,993
You teach me strange things,

337
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:13,811
and you are utterly obsessed
with beating me, like a child.

338
00:18:14,499 --> 00:18:15,507
Hey.

339
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:18,092
I'm not asking what you dislike about me,

340
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:21,207
I'm asking what you like about me.

341
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:24,707
Yeah, I'm telling you
the reasons I like you.

342
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:29,004
Quite cute, huh?

343
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,494
The time I spent with you

344
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,801
is something I will never forget.

345
00:18:36,197 --> 00:18:37,993
I am so envious of Lalatina.

346
00:18:39,904 --> 00:18:43,707
I bet you guys are happy all the time.

347
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:46,999
Tomorrow,

348
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,097
she will definitely go back to being
a princess and keep herself in check,

349
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:53,603
living her life as a good child
who does what she is told.

350
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:58,405
Is it really impossible
for me to stay in this castle?

351
00:18:59,397 --> 00:19:01,608
I wish I could also be an adventurer.

352
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,498
Do you know?

353
00:19:03,906 --> 00:19:07,608
It has been passed down through generations that
the royal family has very strong magical skills and abilities.

354
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,509
It is unlikely that I will be able
to become a cross knight like Lalatina,

355
00:19:11,904 --> 00:19:14,212
but I could be a priest
or a magician instead.

356
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:18,811
I am going to become an adventurer
that will surprise even you.

357
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:22,811
Alternately, I could become a well-known,

358
00:19:22,812 --> 00:19:25,806
chivalrous thief who is infamous
in the city's back alleys and streets.

359
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:28,810
But I am afraid calling out my desire
to become a chivalrous thief

360
00:19:28,811 --> 00:19:30,793
might enrage Claire all over again.

361
00:19:31,408 --> 00:19:32,408
What did you just say?

362
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,900
Chivalrous thief?

363
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:40,493
I have heard that there are thieves
target nobles with bad reputations,

364
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,702
and that after the crime,

365
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:44,509
a substantial donation
is always left in front

366
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:46,905
of the Eris Church orphanage.

367
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:53,003
E-Elder brother?

368
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:56,598
This is it!

369
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:58,201
Konosuba.

370
00:19:58,202 --> 00:20:01,300
-Please have a friendly match with me one day.
-Darkness!

371
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,201
Darkness!

372
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:04,603
Claire, you are here as well.

373
00:20:05,098 --> 00:20:06,717
I-Is there something wrong?

374
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:07,718
I've heard.

375
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:10,603
There is a chivalrous thief in the royal
capital who only targets nobles, right?

376
00:20:10,994 --> 00:20:12,491
Y-Yeah.

377
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:15,702
It appears that all targeted
nobles are corrupt.

378
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:19,806
I'll help you catch that chivalrous thief.

379
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,207
What?

380
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,805
He actually stated that he will apprehend

381
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,597
the thief who has left no clues thus far.

382
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:28,108
What is that nasty man talking about?

383
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:29,201
Despite being ordinary,

384
00:20:29,202 --> 00:20:31,493
-You nobles, I heard everything.
-it looks like he is a friend of Lord Dustiness.

385
00:20:31,494 --> 00:20:32,208
-You nobles, I heard everything.
-He is?

386
00:20:32,209 --> 00:20:34,498
Though he is known as a chivalrous thief,
theft is still theft.

387
00:20:34,499 --> 00:20:36,399
We must not ignore him.

388
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,004
Why would someone
who doesn't care about justice say that?

389
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:41,900
I will stay to keep everyone safe.

390
00:20:42,306 --> 00:20:44,597
You really are…

391
00:20:44,598 --> 00:20:45,905
Amazing!

392
00:20:46,306 --> 00:20:48,801
Truly worthy of being
Lady Dustiness' companion.

393
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:50,092
Don't misunderstand.

394
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:54,103
There was no way that the chivalrous thief
could target me, of course.

395
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:57,102
I am not guilty of anything, too.

396
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:59,295
Of course, I do not think
I would be targeted either.

397
00:20:59,296 --> 00:21:01,411
They are really simple to grasp.

398
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,498
Is that so? Is that so?

399
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:08,801
Want to see your favorite brother
show off his skills?

400
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,306
Leave it to me.

401
00:21:11,306 --> 00:21:12,795
I am going to keep hanging out
in the castle and do nothing.

402
00:21:12,796 --> 00:21:14,702
He will be caught soon enough.

403
00:21:14,702 --> 00:21:17,707
I have high hopes for you, ordinary man.

404
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:19,582
You are more capable than I expected.

405
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:23,197
Quickly apprehend him
and alleviate our concerns.

406
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,801
What? What?

407
00:21:24,802 --> 00:21:27,498
Can we have delicious food
here tomorrow too?

408
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:28,987
Okay, okay.

409
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:29,811
Why do not we just eat
till we are 80% full today

410
00:21:29,812 --> 00:21:31,894
to make room for tomorrow?

411
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,692
What nonsense are you two talking about?

412
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:36,410
Alright then.

413
00:21:37,305 --> 00:21:41,009
Mr. Kazuma, you should go to the house
of the noble who agrees with this idea

414
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,994
and wait for the thief there.

415
00:21:45,093 --> 00:21:47,806
Everyone should try their utmost
to aid Mr. Kazuma.

416
00:21:57,898 --> 00:21:58,998
That's not it!

417
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,093
It's not like that!

418
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:32,103
(Episode 4: Divine Punishment
for This Handsome Chivalrous Thief)

419
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:33,603
They touched!

420
00:23:34,389 --> 00:23:35,696
They touched!

421
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:38,002
Long time no see, Devil King.

422
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:40,001
I am your faithful servant,

423
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,054
