1
00:00:01,797 --> 00:00:04,838
Hey, why you stayed out all night?

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:06,097
Yeah.

3
00:00:06,098 --> 00:00:07,604
You even left this kind of letter!

4
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:10,310
We absolutely disagree!

5
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:13,005
Darkness, Darkness!

6
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:14,109
-Please go back.
-Darkness!

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,204
-The young lady says she is not going to see anyone.
-Darkness!

8
00:00:19,698 --> 00:00:23,500
This thing came loose from your pocket.

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right, as long as you let us in…

10
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:29,390
I-I don't need this!

11
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:30,823
What does it mean

12
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,082
that you write this kind of letter?

13
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,803
We want an explanation from you!

14
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:38,296
Darkness, Darkness!

15
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:40,005
-G-Guards!
-Darkness!

16
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,308
-Quick, get the guards!
-Darkness!

17
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:45,697
We will get lunch ready and wait for you!

18
00:00:45,698 --> 00:00:48,203
Come back before that!

19
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:06,501
(Konosuba Season 3)

20
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:19,833
(Episode 9: Preaching to the Runaway Girl)
She's a pain in the ass.

21
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:20,927
Don't care, don't care!

22
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:21,825
I don't care about her anymore!

23
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:23,619
Yes, you say that,

24
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,310
but are not you still
making things for Darkness?

25
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,299
That is not at all how it is.

26
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,927
I only want to make my life easier
and scam a significant sum of money.

27
00:02:30,928 --> 00:02:32,126
All right, all right.

28
00:02:32,127 --> 00:02:33,004
Listen.

29
00:02:33,005 --> 00:02:34,432
The advice of the demon

30
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:35,126
is generally not a good one.

31
00:02:35,127 --> 00:02:37,248
(Konosuba)
All I want to do is put off work!

32
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,218
Hey, I'll give you pocket money.

33
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,612
Can you please go back to the mansion?

34
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:51,606
I should totally get to
pick a new team member.

35
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:58,422
To actually ditch the buddies
who went through good times and bad,

36
00:02:58,423 --> 00:02:59,713
you are a devil.

37
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:00,719
Devil.

38
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:02,224
I am not.

39
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:04,705
Darkness is the one who wants us
to pick a new team member.

40
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,041
I see.

41
00:03:08,042 --> 00:03:11,116
All three of us have
zero stamina, like, at all!

42
00:03:11,117 --> 00:03:13,303
(Konosuba)
We need a shield role!

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,810
I was just introducing myself.

44
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:22,801
Don't reveal your cards!

45
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,640
I'm Megumin,

46
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,416
the top magician in Axel

47
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,828
who controls explosion magic!

48
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,630
In Axel,

49
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:34,112
I go by the nickname
"crazy explosive girl"!

50
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,713
Is she the one they are rumored about?

51
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:38,714
I'm sorry!

52
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:40,218
I can't handle this job!

53
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,828
Please find someone else!

54
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:44,806
I had a tough time
getting everyone interested,

55
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:45,532
but look at what you have done!

56
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,326
You screamed,

57
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,933
and now everyone's too scared
to even look at us.

58
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,532
Can't be helped.

59
00:03:54,008 --> 00:03:55,799
Let's just go back for today.

60
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:57,817
You totally did that on purpose, right?

61
00:03:57,818 --> 00:03:58,620
You are keeping everyone away on purpose--

62
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:00,131
Kazuma!

63
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,625
What is up? You seem super flustered.

64
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:05,135
Something bad happened,
can you help me out?

65
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:07,333
This dude previously went off to attack
a water snake all by himself before,

66
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,834
and now he is freaking out like this.

67
00:04:10,725 --> 00:04:12,218
It is like a pretty big deal.

68
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,636
Megumin, I will be out for a sec.

69
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:14,823
(Konosuba)

70
00:04:14,824 --> 00:04:17,317
Rin have a boyfriend?

71
00:04:17,318 --> 00:04:18,614
Yeah.

72
00:04:18,615 --> 00:04:20,823
I am really concerned
because my close friend

73
00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:22,136
has been tricked by some random guy.

74
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,810
R-Right.

75
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,615
You know, Rin has been so difficult
to get in touch with lately.

76
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:28,952
It has been bothering me,

77
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:30,323
so I ended up spending
the whole day following her.

78
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:33,428
And guess what? I found out she went to
a motel with an unknown man.

79
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:34,623
That's…

80
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:35,427
That's stalk--

81
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:37,130
I was just sorta worried about my buddy!

82
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:38,829
Please, help me out!

83
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,215
I don't think that's a good idea…

84
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,703
Alright.

85
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:46,031
You're so nice, Kazuma.

86
00:04:46,032 --> 00:04:47,032
Here, these are for you.

87
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,229
Here it is.

88
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,126
The jerk who tricked Rin is right here.

89
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:54,810
So, you are not planning
on going in straight, huh?

90
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:57,339
How long do you think
I have been an adventurer?

91
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,024
If I do not watch my back and be smart,

92
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:02,121
I will not make it
in this gig for much longer.

93
00:05:07,115 --> 00:05:08,917
The walls are super thin,
so we gotta be careful.

94
00:05:09,617 --> 00:05:10,327
That's…

95
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:11,418
That's stalk--

96
00:05:11,823 --> 00:05:13,114
Miss Rin.

97
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:15,833
Now that I have fallen for you,
there is nothing I can do.

98
00:05:15,834 --> 00:05:17,015
C-Calm down.

99
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:19,625
How can a noble like you
fall for an adventurer?

100
00:05:21,427 --> 00:05:23,031
I understand that
our statuses may not align…

101
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:23,923
But at least…

102
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:27,520
At least let me take a photo
with this magic camera.

103
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:28,636
Calm down.

104
00:05:28,637 --> 00:05:29,823
Please calm down!

105
00:05:29,824 --> 00:05:31,119
Keep your reason!

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,515
I see.

107
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:35,130
He knows they can't be together,

108
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:37,427
so he hopes to at least snap a photo?

109
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:39,328
He is not, like, a bad person or anything.

110
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,015
I'd like to see something sensational.

111
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:43,422
Like this! More sensational!

112
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:45,225
He's a piece of shit!

113
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:48,312
I am going to pummel him.

114
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:50,010
Hey, wait, don't go!

115
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:50,823
Calm down.

116
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:52,724
Alright, just clean your heart first.

117
00:05:52,725 --> 00:05:54,922
Let's head downstairs
and grab a cup of tea.

118
00:05:54,923 --> 00:05:56,510
-Calm down, please!
-Please

119
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:58,823
(Konosuba)
I'd like to see something sensational!

120
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:06,292
Really?

121
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,531
Unforgivable.

122
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:09,511
This jerk!

123
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:10,418
I am going to screw it up!

124
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,011
Hey, if you mess up the room…

125
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:14,621
Ouch.

126
00:06:18,719 --> 00:06:19,728
Kazuma.

127
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:20,214
Yes?

128
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:22,131
Just grab that camera over there
and snap a pic of me.

129
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:25,619
I want to fill up all the photo film
with my nudity

130
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,037
and leave him with some serious
long-term psychological scars.

131
00:06:33,898 --> 00:06:36,692
Don't you run away.

132
00:06:37,928 --> 00:06:39,208
(Konosuba)
Of course.

133
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:40,427
Very good, Dust.

134
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:41,720
That's right.

135
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:51,527
So, how many pics did we actually snap?

136
00:06:53,435 --> 00:06:56,027
I stand on the table,
looking down at Dust,

137
00:06:56,526 --> 00:06:58,333
and roll around on the ground,

138
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:01,027
shooting him fiercely from all angles.

139
00:07:01,525 --> 00:07:02,427
Good!

140
00:07:02,428 --> 00:07:04,734
Now, give it a cool vibe.

141
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:06,422
Spread your legs. Squat low.

142
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:08,501
Yes, that's right.

143
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:11,620
Go on!

144
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:27,812
So, what are you doing?

145
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:30,193
Sorry.

146
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:33,423
I totally got hooked on taking photos.

147
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:36,620
You had me freaking out for no reason.

148
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,412
Feel free to handle that jerk.

149
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:41,323
Okay, Kazuma.

150
00:07:41,324 --> 00:07:42,126
Let's go.

151
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,427
Nah, letting them both
stay together is kinda…

152
00:07:44,428 --> 00:07:45,428
Enough, hurry up.

153
00:07:50,692 --> 00:07:53,390
I was not expecting to see you in my room.

154
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,616
What? Got any issues with that?

155
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,131
Right.

156
00:07:57,132 --> 00:07:59,829
How about we have a candid and
honest conversation, just between us guys?

157
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:03,631
Be prepared.

158
00:08:04,928 --> 00:08:06,218
Hey, Rin.

159
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,833
We should probably stop them.

160
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:09,031
In this rate…

161
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:10,619
I have put in a lot of effort, you know.

162
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,620
Yeah, a lot.

163
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,619
But he showed up in the room
dressed that way in the end.

164
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,927
It is like a fool just walking right
into the trap, ya know?

165
00:08:17,928 --> 00:08:19,724
I could not even save him, man.

166
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:25,020
I am really touched.

167
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:27,323
I never saw it coming…

168
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:28,145
You would be completely wrong

169
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:28,834
if you assumed that

170
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:29,938
I would be scared just
because you are a noble.

171
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,933
I gotta say, I am pretty used to dealing
with royal families and nobles.

172
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,427
Used to…

173
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:38,121
So there really is a god.

174
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:41,328
I am glad I joined the order.

175
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:43,041
Listen.

176
00:08:43,042 --> 00:08:44,915
There are two men here.

177
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,458
Nothing more than that!

178
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,418
Wha--

179
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:49,219
Forget about the status.

180
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:53,218
Today is so freaking awesome!

181
00:08:53,219 --> 00:08:55,031
I appreciate you very much,

182
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:57,027
Lady Aqua.

183
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,026
Actually,

184
00:09:01,027 --> 00:09:03,143
that noble dude is into Dust.

185
00:09:03,852 --> 00:09:05,686
What'd you just say?

186
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:06,937
That noble

187
00:09:06,938 --> 00:09:09,223
told me he likes Dust,

188
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:10,517
and he came to talk to me about it.

189
00:09:11,223 --> 00:09:14,510
I politely told him that
there is probably no chance,

190
00:09:14,511 --> 00:09:17,337
but he said he hopes
to get a photo of Dust, at least.

191
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,818
So this means, Dust…

192
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,598
Today, nothing went down.

193
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,531
R-Right.

194
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:36,883
Speaking of nobles…

195
00:09:36,884 --> 00:09:37,676
Stop it!

196
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:39,284
I am so over this whole nobles thing!

197
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:40,487
No, no, it's not that.

198
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:42,086
I'm talking about Lalatina.

199
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:43,186
Darkness?

200
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:45,790
Everyone is buzzing about it -

201
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,987
the young lady from the Dustiness family

202
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,493
is about to tie the knot with Aldarp.

203
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:52,482
Huh?

204
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,899
Tell me more.

205
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,516
Marriage?

206
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:02,631
This is really annoying.

207
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:04,819
Then it will totally match up
with the demon's fortune-telling.

208
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:07,219
Do you really believe it?

209
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:10,823
I think Vanir talks about
a lot of stuff in a vague way,

210
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:12,521
but anything about that lord

211
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:15,522
is a whole different story.

212
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,614
We gotta track down Darkness
and ask for some clarification!

213
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:20,209
Right, right?

214
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,245
Really!

215
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:25,318
That guy has been a real pain
in the butt since forever.

216
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:27,323
Since Rin told us about this,

217
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:29,116
I don't have any other option.

218
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:30,827
Don't have any other option.

219
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,022
So, Aqua, I am counting on you.

220
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:35,527
Leave it to me.

221
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:36,917
Powered.

222
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:38,213
Speed Gain.

223
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:39,719
Resist Magic.

224
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,621
Versatile Entertainer.

225
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,220
What's the last one for?

226
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:46,609
Magic that transforms one
into a master of talents.

227
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,411
It hurts!

228
00:10:49,412 --> 00:10:51,932
-Are you going by yourself?
-Don't pull so hard, okay?

229
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,323
-Since I have got this lurk skill,
-Ouch!

230
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:55,726
it would be way easier for me
to succeed if I went alone.

231
00:10:55,727 --> 00:10:57,730
Just wait for me in the mansion.

232
00:10:58,223 --> 00:10:59,223
You must do a good job.

233
00:10:59,928 --> 00:11:01,022
I'll be back shortly.

234
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:05,021
That's strange.

235
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:07,614
Nothing is going on, Norris.

236
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:09,125
Hey, let us head to the kitchen downstairs

237
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,401
and fix us a late-night snack.

238
00:11:10,402 --> 00:11:13,912
I think I heard something.

239
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:15,834
Alright.

240
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:18,120
Where's Darkness?

241
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,209
That's right, the kitchen…

242
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,713
If Darkness orders a late-night snack,

243
00:11:23,714 --> 00:11:26,130
I could just go to her room
with the delivered meal.

244
00:11:26,721 --> 00:11:28,009
It does not really seem doable.

245
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,429
I wish I could imitate voices…

246
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,720
My name is Norris.

247
00:11:38,313 --> 00:11:39,708
I was just trying.

248
00:11:39,709 --> 00:11:41,813
Can a master of talents truly
accomplish something like this?

249
00:11:41,814 --> 00:11:43,422
Mr. Kazuma is amazing.

250
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:45,323
Hold me.

251
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:46,812
This is so useful.

252
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:48,114
This is extremely useful.

253
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,110
Once I am back, I gotta say sorry to Aqua.

254
00:11:54,608 --> 00:11:56,303
I have got some food for you.

255
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:58,323
I don't think I ordered anything.

256
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:01,099
But Mr. Norris said…

257
00:12:01,918 --> 00:12:03,015
Sorry.

258
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:04,209
Just give me a break, okay?

259
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:05,922
Sorry.

260
00:12:09,524 --> 00:12:10,522
Young lady.

261
00:12:10,523 --> 00:12:13,510
A man named Satou Kazuma
is coming in the middle of the night…

262
00:12:13,511 --> 00:12:15,329
I already told you,
no need to tell me these.

263
00:12:17,418 --> 00:12:19,230
He actually comes at this hour.

264
00:12:20,103 --> 00:12:21,033
Geez.

265
00:12:21,813 --> 00:12:22,724
Geez.

266
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,818
But, young lady,

267
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:26,427
that Kazuma man told me

268
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:27,724
that if I do not tell you,

269
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:29,125
he will tell everyone in the guild

270
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:32,819
your embarrassing secret.

271
00:12:33,918 --> 00:12:35,118
That guy really is…

272
00:12:35,717 --> 00:12:37,319
Tell him to do as he likes.

273
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:40,120
I am not going to go to
the guild again, anyway.

274
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:41,623
But, young lady,

275
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:42,916
that guy told me

276
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:46,812
that you have abs now,

277
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:47,921
and that made him uneasy.

278
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:50,604
He thinks you should eat less protein.

279
00:12:50,605 --> 00:12:51,376
Wha…

280
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,807
He also said you would
put on a cute dress,

281
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:55,512
look at yourself in the mirror,

282
00:12:55,513 --> 00:12:57,208
and then laugh to yourself.

283
00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:00,109
He wants us to get you such cute clothes.

284
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,018
T-Those are lies.

285
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:03,520
Don't let him fool you.

286
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:07,208
But he said something
even more mind-blowing.

287
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:08,219
Can I say it?

288
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:10,928
Let's hear it.

289
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:15,318
You can't hold on
your curvy body all the time,

290
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:16,225
every night…

291
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,331
Break in!

292
00:13:23,022 --> 00:13:24,838
I have been boosted by some support magic,

293
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,419
so I will not easily
lose to your strength.

294
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,708
D-Don't get me wrong.

295
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,824
I just want to ask some questions.

296
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:41,026
Hey!

297
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:42,917
Don't close your eyes
like you are giving up!

298
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:43,626
Don't close your eyes.

299
00:13:43,627 --> 00:13:44,631
Don't close your eyes!

300
00:13:45,016 --> 00:13:45,719
Listen.

301
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,771
I'm letting go of you now.

302
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:48,021
Don't scream, okay?

303
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:54,709
Okay.

304
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,120
Then, I'm going to let go.

305
00:13:57,918 --> 00:13:59,507
Thief!

306
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,411
You set me up!

307
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:04,122
Ugh, I have been way too careless!

308
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:05,625
L-Lady Lalatina!

309
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:07,616
How dare you set me up?

310
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:11,318
What happened?

311
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,380
I'll open the door right away!

312
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:13,422
Don't!

313
00:14:13,423 --> 00:14:16,109
I can't be seen in this outfit right now.

314
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,015
I was playing this really intense game

315
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:20,318
and I couldn't help but scream
because it was so exciting!

316
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:23,515
Is it really late at night to play games?

317
00:14:23,516 --> 00:14:25,510
It is a game that adults
can play by themselves.

318
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:27,110
Please, don't make me say it.
It is really embarrassing.

319
00:14:28,323 --> 00:14:29,823
Y-Young lady.

320
00:14:29,824 --> 00:14:31,323
-What?
-Seriously?

321
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:32,828
So, you are saying you want to
make sure I am safe,

322
00:14:32,829 --> 00:14:34,819
but you are actually interested
in seeing my less refined side, huh?

323
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,224
You are quite the pervert!

324
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:38,709
What's wrong with you?

325
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:40,313
I-It's nothing!

326
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:43,120
I totally forgot to turn off
that erotic, magical toy!

327
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:45,361
I-It's going to break!

328
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:48,911
Things are about to get really weird!

329
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:51,328
If this keeps going like this,
it is going to break!

330
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,001
S-Sorry to interrupt!

331
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:02,722
Geez.

332
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:04,713
From tomorrow on, people at home

333
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:06,516
will start calling me
a perverted young lady.

334
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:10,522
You just thought that might
not be a bad idea, right?

335
00:15:10,523 --> 00:15:11,522
(Konosuba)
Not that I thought.

336
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:12,814
That is exactly what you thought.

337
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,406
In debt?

338
00:15:15,407 --> 00:15:16,417
That's right.

339
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,928
So basically, the nobleman's daughter
has to marry the person who lent us money.

340
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:21,824
That is all there is to it.

341
00:15:24,421 --> 00:15:26,616
You are familiar with my interests
and hobbies, aren't you?

342
00:15:28,112 --> 00:15:29,521
I guess the guy will be
starving and thirsty,

343
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:32,021
craving my body.

344
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:33,220
It's really exciting.

345
00:15:34,422 --> 00:15:35,527
Idiot.

346
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:37,626
Why do you look so lonely,

347
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:40,719
if that is the case?

348
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,823
That's why you are hoping we can
take on the water snake on our own?

349
00:15:45,818 --> 00:15:47,109
I ended up getting a bunch of people

350
00:15:47,115 --> 00:15:48,621
involved and interfering.

351
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:52,611
How much is the debt?

352
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:54,120
For the insufficient money…

353
00:15:54,121 --> 00:15:56,027
Don't say you're going to pay, Kazuma.

354
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:57,912
I am a noble.

355
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,515
How can I allow the regular folks,
whom I am supposed to look out for,

356
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:02,417
to use the money they earn
from their hard work

357
00:16:02,418 --> 00:16:04,220
to pay off my debt?

358
00:16:05,113 --> 00:16:06,714
If that is the situation,
I would rather just sell myself.

359
00:16:21,524 --> 00:16:22,610
I would rather have

360
00:16:23,313 --> 00:16:26,719
my body taken away by that lord.

361
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:34,823
Hey, Kazuma.

362
00:16:34,824 --> 00:16:35,524
Yes?

363
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:38,829
How about we…

364
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,017
Darkness…

365
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,329
You…

366
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:50,623
You really do have abs.

367
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,422
(Konosuba)

368
00:16:53,423 --> 00:16:55,500
Sorry, it's my fault!

369
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:57,422
I really can't handle this atmosphere!

370
00:16:57,423 --> 00:16:59,922
There are definitely times
when I get really angry.

371
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:01,828
How dare you do this to a woman
who's made up her mind…

372
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:03,214
I'm going to kill you!

373
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:05,512
What?

374
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:07,208
You are really into me, huh?

375
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:10,219
Just say it straight up, young lady!

376
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,323
I will not like someone like you, dummy!

377
00:17:12,324 --> 00:17:13,708
It is so frustrating, you know?

378
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:15,614
And stop calling me young lady!

379
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:17,417
Young lady, I'm going to open the door!

380
00:17:17,418 --> 00:17:18,739
Don't!

381
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,417
Lalatina is totally naked at the moment!

382
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:22,417
-You can't look!
-Totally…

383
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:23,953
My deepest apologies!

384
00:17:23,954 --> 00:17:27,005
Don't use my voice to say that!

385
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:28,326
Hey, there's an intruder!

386
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:30,449
He is got this skill
where he can imitate my voice.

387
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,830
Yes, we'll go in right away!

388
00:17:31,831 --> 00:17:33,021
Damn it.

389
00:17:33,022 --> 00:17:34,210
Create Earth.

390
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,818
Everyone, close your eyes!

391
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:38,319
Wind Breath.

392
00:17:41,418 --> 00:17:43,064
(Konosuba)
Lurk.

393
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:45,187
We must not allow him to get away!

394
00:17:45,188 --> 00:17:46,521
Kazuma!

395
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:47,142
If you will only step out now

396
00:17:47,143 --> 00:17:49,323
and take ten full punches from me,
I will let you go.

397
00:17:49,324 --> 00:17:51,312
You better believe I will not

398
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:53,917
give you much of a pass
if I track you down.

399
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:56,027
This is bad. Things are looking bleak.

400
00:17:56,516 --> 00:17:57,417
Let's go back.

401
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:04,110
Okay.

402
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:06,015
All I have to do
is jump out of the window…

403
00:18:06,016 --> 00:18:08,116
Is anybody there?

404
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,714
It's you.

405
00:18:14,816 --> 00:18:16,913
Why did you come here
in the middle of the night?

406
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:19,209
W-Well.

407
00:18:19,712 --> 00:18:21,522
I see.

408
00:18:21,523 --> 00:18:24,626
It looks like my daughter
has found an amazing companion.

409
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,512
A true confidant
of the kingdom, I must say.

410
00:18:29,513 --> 00:18:31,521
He totally gets why I came here.

411
00:18:32,521 --> 00:18:35,213
I'm sorry to be a bother
when you're not feeling well.

412
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:37,427
Your daughter is really mad.

413
00:18:37,428 --> 00:18:39,022
Can you go and convince her?

414
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:40,609
I see.

415
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,010
My daughter has been feeling
really down lately,

416
00:18:43,011 --> 00:18:44,829
and now she is getting so angry.

417
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:47,730
This is not funny at all.

418
00:18:48,824 --> 00:18:50,824
I heard you have debts.

419
00:18:51,415 --> 00:18:52,277
I honestly don't think

420
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:55,121
you would borrow money
from someone like that.

421
00:18:57,524 --> 00:19:01,323
You are pretty smart, Kazuma, aren't you?

422
00:19:01,324 --> 00:19:04,725
I think I should trust you
with my daughter.

423
00:19:05,215 --> 00:19:06,121
What?

424
00:19:06,122 --> 00:19:07,323
I'm sorry.

425
00:19:07,324 --> 00:19:10,334
Can you just take her
and run away somewhere else?

426
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,719
I was just asking you about the debt.

427
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,017
Why are you suggesting
that I elope with your daughter?

428
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:16,917
I refuse.

429
00:19:16,918 --> 00:19:18,818
I absolutely refuse.

430
00:19:18,819 --> 00:19:20,588
It's your daughter who is chasing me.

431
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:22,125
That is why I have run away to this room.

432
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:26,225
Kazuma.

433
00:19:27,222 --> 00:19:29,615
Can you please not ask why?

434
00:19:30,423 --> 00:19:31,329
Don't worry.

435
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,719
I will just sell this mansion

436
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,522
after you run away with my daughter…

437
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:39,324
Are you feeling unwell?

438
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,584
Our team has this amazing

439
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:43,324
Arch Priest who is really great
at healing magic.

440
00:19:44,414 --> 00:19:48,026
No, healing magic can't cure illness,

441
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:50,802
and it can't resurrect someone

442
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:52,939
who has died from a disease, either.

443
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:55,417
When someone gets sick, it's like
they are getting closer to their end.

444
00:19:55,418 --> 00:19:57,417
If you are nearing the end,

445
00:19:57,418 --> 00:19:59,824
don't expect a miracle from God.

446
00:20:02,521 --> 00:20:03,652
There is

447
00:20:04,105 --> 00:20:06,417
no need for that face.

448
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:11,906
Kazuma!

449
00:20:11,907 --> 00:20:13,031
Come out!

450
00:20:13,032 --> 00:20:15,704
I will definitely make you
regret imitating my voice!

451
00:20:16,313 --> 00:20:17,537
This time I must…

452
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:20,220
Okay? I am trusting you with her.

453
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:21,510
I'm going to kill you!

454
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,730
Oh, I really don't want that.

455
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:26,510
Gotcha!

456
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:28,505
So, how do you plan on compensating me?

457
00:20:28,506 --> 00:20:30,328
Hey, please be quiet!

458
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,625
Shut up!

459
00:20:31,626 --> 00:20:33,120
The person I am worried about

460
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:34,495
hurt my image so badly

461
00:20:34,496 --> 00:20:36,219
in such a short time.

462
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,104
What I just said is totally true!

463
00:20:38,105 --> 00:20:39,917
How could it be true?

464
00:20:40,425 --> 00:20:41,901
Forget about the debt.

465
00:20:41,902 --> 00:20:43,433
Let's all run away together!

466
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:45,620
Aqua and Megumin
will not sit on their hands

467
00:20:45,621 --> 00:20:47,911
if I return alone.

468
00:20:47,912 --> 00:20:50,724
Megumin might just blow up
the wedding ceremony too!

469
00:20:50,725 --> 00:20:52,215
Go ahead and give it a shot
if you are up for it!

470
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:53,719
Everyone's going to
be sentenced to hanging!

471
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,611
Make sure to look after them for me!

472
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:58,329
You are such an inflexible
and stubborn woman!

473
00:21:01,415 --> 00:21:02,615
I won't run away.

474
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,318
If I run away,

475
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:05,928
someone is going to
get implicated for sure.

476
00:21:09,024 --> 00:21:10,829
Forget it, do as you please!

477
00:21:11,414 --> 00:21:12,360
If you need me to save you,

478
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:14,599
just come over to the mansion,
say sorry, and tell me,

479
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,819
"I need Lord Kazuma's rescue."

480
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:21,435
So hard…

481
00:21:23,714 --> 00:21:25,620
A-Are you okay, Kazuma?

482
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,620
You should be the one saying,

483
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,015
"Sorry, and please save me."

484
00:21:32,016 --> 00:21:33,917
I can provide medical treatment.

485
00:21:35,115 --> 00:21:37,120
D-Damn it.

486
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,193
I will not save you until you come

487
00:21:39,194 --> 00:21:41,328
to me crying and begging, no doubt!

488
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:43,501
Idiot, idiot!

489
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:44,438
It hurts!

490
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:46,521
It not hurts, idiot!

491
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:57,406
Aqua!

492
00:21:57,407 --> 00:21:58,324
Heal me.

493
00:21:58,325 --> 00:22:01,116
Heal me.

494
00:23:31,003 --> 00:23:32,014
(Episode 10: Wishes
for the Stubborn Bride)

495
00:23:32,015 --> 00:23:34,412
I am Beldia,
a leader of the Devil King's army.

496
00:23:35,318 --> 00:23:37,200
On behalf of the entire Devil King's Army,

497
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:38,805
I congratulate

498
00:23:39,515 --> 00:23:41,117
Lalatina Ford Dustiness.
