1
00:00:00,995 --> 00:00:03,897
Lord Aldarp is going to have a wedding.

2
00:00:03,898 --> 00:00:05,397
What a joyous occasion.

3
00:00:05,398 --> 00:00:06,694
-Aldarp
-The lady over there and thee little boy,

4
00:00:06,695 --> 00:00:08,596
-might be getting impatient.
-take one too.

5
00:00:08,597 --> 00:00:10,007
Skipped various steps

6
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:12,003
and set the wedding date.

7
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,502
Kazuma, this isn't the time to fight.

8
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:21,188
She said this was her decision, right?

9
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,569
Before she apologizes to me in tears,

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,696
I won't do anything.

11
00:00:26,404 --> 00:00:28,387
I won't agree to this.

12
00:00:28,388 --> 00:00:30,508
If you go on like this to the big day,

13
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,289
I'll have my own plans.

14
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:35,915
Hey, don't do anything dangerous.

15
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,507
Alright, give that back to me.

16
00:00:37,508 --> 00:00:39,925
I've been working on it all morning.

17
00:00:41,305 --> 00:00:43,513
What is this?

18
00:00:45,398 --> 00:00:46,801
It's for popping.

19
00:00:46,802 --> 00:00:48,304
Pop them one by one.

20
00:00:48,305 --> 00:00:49,814
It's an entertainment

21
00:00:49,815 --> 00:00:51,768
to keep you relaxed.

22
00:00:53,104 --> 00:00:54,419
Is that it?

23
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:56,320
That's it.

24
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:20,503
(Konosuba S3)

25
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:34,486
Hello?

26
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,513
(Episode 10: Wishes for the Stubborn Bride)
I have come here

27
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:40,386
to consult with Mr. Kazuma.

28
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,661
Has Darkness finally given in?

29
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:48,158
She's asking for my help…?

30
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:51,289
To the Dustiness family.

31
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,486
I've received news through connections

32
00:02:52,487 --> 00:02:54,690
that a senior member
of the Devil King's Army

33
00:02:54,692 --> 00:02:56,527
will carry out a terrorist attack

34
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:59,081
at Axel's Eris Order.

35
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,184
The attack is scheduled
on the wedding day.

36
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:04,393
If the wedding is not
canceled immediately,

37
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:09,289
the church will be blown away
by Explosion on that day.

38
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,195
I hope you will heed my advice.

39
00:03:13,196 --> 00:03:15,169
With kind regards, the magician.

40
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,893
I am very sorry!

41
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:19,445
I will give that idiot a good scolding!

42
00:03:19,446 --> 00:03:20,696
(Konosuba)
Megumin!

43
00:03:20,697 --> 00:03:22,681
I have something to say to you. Come out!

44
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:26,796
The days without Darkness
passed by just like that.

45
00:03:27,595 --> 00:03:29,779
I've decided to leave it be.

46
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,456
As for the two of them…

47
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:34,790
Look, out of this tiny pouch,

48
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,193
a Beginner's Bane will emerge.

49
00:03:37,194 --> 00:03:38,894
Don't let it out!

50
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:40,394
Hey, what are you doing?

51
00:03:40,395 --> 00:03:41,488
Let me go.

52
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:42,994
So many people are gathered here

53
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:45,180
to watch my performance!

54
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:47,134
That's why I was called here.

55
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:48,352
What you're doing
at someone else's doorstep

56
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,289
is causing them a lot of trouble.

57
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:50,085
-I was told to stop you.
-Let me go!

58
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:51,581
-Hey, show us!
-Everyone is waiting.

59
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:53,598
-Yeah.
-Show us!

60
00:03:54,285 --> 00:03:56,290
Please don't tip.

61
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,956
Because I am not a performer.

62
00:03:57,957 --> 00:03:59,785
Please don't tip.

63
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,085
Kazuma.

64
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:01,394
What?

65
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:05,279
It's a strategy to lure Darkness
out of her home.

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,087
What?

67
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:06,889
Exactly.

68
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:10,167
Don't you know the story of Amano-Iwato?

69
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,181
Yes, that's it.

70
00:04:11,592 --> 00:04:14,784
Hey! Darkness, do you hear me?

71
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:16,988
Come out quickly!

72
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,587
Come!

73
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:19,790
You'll regret it if you don't
come closer to watch.

74
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:21,482
I'm going to perform my best act.

75
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,899
Hey, Kazuma!

76
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,482
What are you doing? Let me go!

77
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:27,185
It's enough, we're going back.

78
00:04:27,186 --> 00:04:28,378
No!

79
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:29,889
Before Darkness comes out,

80
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,093
I will perform here every day.

81
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:33,685
Hey, Darkness!

82
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:36,785
Darkness!

83
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:39,092
A few days later.

84
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:44,894
I'm back.

85
00:04:44,895 --> 00:04:47,088
Has it been three days already?

86
00:04:47,685 --> 00:04:48,879
I told you, didn't I?

87
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:51,498
You'll get arrested for
sending threatening letters.

88
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,488
You better behave.

89
00:04:56,287 --> 00:04:58,290
Up to now, you and Aqua

90
00:04:58,291 --> 00:05:00,676
have only been causing trouble
for the Dustiness family.

91
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:05,290
Kazuma, it's about time you help out.

92
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,890
If Darkness asks me, I'll help.

93
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,784
How cold-blooded.

94
00:05:11,785 --> 00:05:14,999
The people in town call you scum or trash.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,588
I thought no matter what they said,

96
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,087
you wouldn't abandon a friend in trouble

97
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:21,593
and would step up at critical times.

98
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:29,181
At times like this, the one I love

99
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:33,404
would look annoyed

100
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:35,686
and complain,

101
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:37,004
but he would still help me.

102
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,191
That's the kind of person he is.

103
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,320
If you think this vague confession

104
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,390
will make me help you,

105
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:46,780
you're greatly mistaken.

106
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:48,681
I'm not so easily fooled.

107
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,787
(Konosuba)
Stop it!

108
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:55,118
Stop!

109
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,784
And finally,

110
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:02,384
the day of Darkness' wedding came.

111
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:06,685
Let's go, Kazuma.

112
00:06:06,686 --> 00:06:08,988
Let's ruin the wedding.

113
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:12,790
Magic can accidentally destroy the venue

114
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:15,581
or the lord's house.

115
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:17,186
It happens all the time.

116
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:19,279
Hey, don't do that.

117
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,389
I mean it.

118
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:22,791
Not only will we end up in debt again,

119
00:06:22,793 --> 00:06:25,191
but this can make us criminals.

120
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:27,088
You'll regret it if you don't go.

121
00:06:28,103 --> 00:06:29,394
I won't go.

122
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:30,491
What?

123
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,284
You don't care about that lord

124
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:37,503
doing whatever he wants to Darkness?

125
00:06:37,504 --> 00:06:39,988
Do you really not care?

126
00:06:40,496 --> 00:06:42,187
Of course I care!

127
00:06:44,995 --> 00:06:46,785
Of course I care.

128
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,499
You may not know

129
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,477
that the man will stop at nothing

130
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,796
to possess the women he desires.

131
00:06:57,798 --> 00:06:59,894
After he grows tired of them,

132
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,593
he discards them with a small alimony.

133
00:07:02,196 --> 00:07:03,795
What's worse,

134
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:05,691
despite his despicable behavior,

135
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,390
we just can't find the crucial
evidence for some reason.

136
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,993
His reputation is terrible.

137
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:15,285
Then we should go.

138
00:07:15,286 --> 00:07:16,389
If you go,

139
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,187
you should be able to
come up with some ideas.

140
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:23,603
This time, I'm powerless.

141
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,994
It's a wedding between nobles.

142
00:07:27,694 --> 00:07:29,383
The security is strict.

143
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:30,889
No matter what we do,

144
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,197
we can't get close to them.

145
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:35,279
Rather, this is precisely why

146
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,186
I've been waiting
for Darkness to ask me for help.

147
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,796
Kazuma.

148
00:07:41,781 --> 00:07:44,092
Darkness' father is seriously ill.

149
00:07:45,092 --> 00:07:47,889
And I have no noble connections
who could introduce me.

150
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,790
After all, I'm just
an insignificant adventurer.

151
00:07:56,593 --> 00:07:59,187
This is what they call
a disparity in social status.

152
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:01,284
Besides,

153
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,603
Darkness and we live in different worlds.

154
00:08:05,488 --> 00:08:07,801
That we've managed to go on
adventures together up till now

155
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,187
is in itself a miracle.

156
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:22,576
Now I know

157
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:25,285
you're also trying to help her.

158
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:29,087
For me, that's enough.

159
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:34,977
I will figure out a way by myself.

160
00:08:34,978 --> 00:08:36,883
I'll embark on a path I won't regret.

161
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:39,488
I hope you'll give it some thought

162
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:42,494
and then set out on a path
you won't regret.

163
00:08:44,896 --> 00:08:45,896
I'm going.

164
00:08:53,192 --> 00:08:54,786
What can I do with her?

165
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,784
Hi, hello!

166
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,795
Leave your unreliable partners.

167
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:01,375
A clairvoyant demon came to your rescue.

168
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:02,390
Vanir?

169
00:09:02,392 --> 00:09:04,533
Weep with joy at my arrival.

170
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:06,383
Cheer with all your might.

171
00:09:06,384 --> 00:09:07,186
Come,

172
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:10,092
let me see all your
intellectual properties.

173
00:09:10,494 --> 00:09:11,385
What?

174
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:12,967
Why must I do business with you

175
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:15,499
when I'm so dispirited?

176
00:09:15,501 --> 00:09:17,798
Bring the beautiful lady manager.

177
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:19,878
That debt-generating machine

178
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,785
can't possibly do business properly.

179
00:09:22,283 --> 00:09:24,389
Yesterday, when I wasn't paying attention,

180
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,503
'This can be sold to adventurer couple,'
she said,

181
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:30,284
and purchased this necklace.

182
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:31,389
What is that?

183
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:34,795
When the one wearing this
suffers a fatal injury,

184
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:38,515
it'll catch fire and explode
right before they die.

185
00:09:38,988 --> 00:09:40,181
The concept

186
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:43,389
is to sacrifice one's life

187
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,185
to protect someone important.

188
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,481
Isn't that romantic?

189
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,680
She said this with a smile.

190
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:53,235
But its power is too strong.

191
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:53,879
Not to mention the enemy,

192
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,258
even the one who should
have been protected

193
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:57,698
will be blasted away.

194
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,191
This is an item that makes one question

195
00:09:59,192 --> 00:10:02,385
the store owner's intelligence.

196
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:04,587
Do you want this?

197
00:10:05,198 --> 00:10:06,796
Nope.

198
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:09,702
Right, what do you mean
you came to my rescue?

199
00:10:11,992 --> 00:10:13,575
It seems you've followed my advice

200
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:15,999
and have been working hard on products.

201
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:18,594
Therefore…

202
00:10:22,494 --> 00:10:26,186
These… are my intellectual properties.

203
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:28,181
I have no intention of selling them cheap.

204
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:30,772
You want to save her,

205
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:32,727
yet you fear being rejected
by the girl in armor

206
00:10:32,728 --> 00:10:35,192
if you go there.

207
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,592
The demon Vanir hereby declares

208
00:10:38,593 --> 00:10:41,581
to purchase all of your
intellectual property rights.

209
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,399
The money in this bag

210
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,285
will certainly fulfill your wishes.

211
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,612
Then let me confirm

212
00:10:50,613 --> 00:10:52,512
all your properties and rights.

213
00:10:52,513 --> 00:10:53,840
Vanir,

214
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:55,732
you can know many things, right?

215
00:10:56,764 --> 00:10:57,598
Hm.

216
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:59,508
I can foresee most things.

217
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,853
For example, the question you want to ask.

218
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:04,105
Of course, I also know

219
00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:05,929
why the girl in armor

220
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,716
owes the lord a huge debt,

221
00:11:09,307 --> 00:11:10,523
and why no evidence can be found

222
00:11:10,524 --> 00:11:13,118
after that lord

223
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,628
have done so many evil things.

224
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:17,821
Hey.

225
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:19,419
-You are a demon…
-A demon,

226
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,018
yet why so eager to help?

227
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:23,430
Is there some ulterior motive?

228
00:11:24,229 --> 00:11:26,109
Of course, there is.

229
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,628
After all, I am a demon.

230
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:31,925
However, this time our interests align.

231
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:33,113
That's why I would help you.

232
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:35,893
For instance, I could take this chance

233
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:37,326
to have you sell all sorts of rights

234
00:11:37,328 --> 00:11:38,632
you have hidden away for emergencies

235
00:11:38,633 --> 00:11:41,216
at a cheap price.

236
00:11:41,714 --> 00:11:43,325
The clairvoyant Mr. Demon.

237
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:45,123
You're a tough opponent.

238
00:11:45,813 --> 00:11:46,732
So,

239
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:48,424
since you know my questions,

240
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:50,419
then you might as well just tell me.

241
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,024
Alright, alright.

242
00:11:52,026 --> 00:11:53,612
I'll tell you.

243
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,217
Sacred Exorcism!

244
00:12:00,216 --> 00:12:01,320
Wait!

245
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,622
Aren't you a powerful demon?

246
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:05,014
You couldn't possibly be defeated
by the Goddess of Toilets!

247
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:05,623
What?

248
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,122
I was away for a little bit.

249
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:08,929
Why have you become a demon's friend?

250
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,924
And besides, I am the Goddess of Water.

251
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:12,804
You always meddle.

252
00:12:12,805 --> 00:12:14,502
Never to be seen when you're needed.

253
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:17,018
I went to receive guests.

254
00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:18,929
What guest?

255
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,024
The steward… Sir?

256
00:12:21,734 --> 00:12:24,908
You seem to be busy.

257
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:26,721
Then I will take my leave.

258
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,623
No, this is…

259
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:34,194
Daring to ambush me? How bold.

260
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:35,320
Rogue goddess.

261
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,419
Look.

262
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,210
My handsome mask is cracked.

263
00:12:39,211 --> 00:12:40,800
Shut it.

264
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,924
Do I have to declare in advance

265
00:12:42,925 --> 00:12:46,097
every time I expel pests?

266
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,521
Are you stupid?

267
00:12:47,523 --> 00:12:49,128
Pfft pfft.

268
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,419
Pfft pfft.

269
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:51,711
(Konosuba)
Hey, stop interfering with us.

270
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,491
Alright, the man with
the goddess by his side

271
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:58,205
yet cannot rely on her.

272
00:12:58,206 --> 00:12:59,939
What you want to know is

273
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,700
why the girl in armor is in debt, right?

274
00:13:02,702 --> 00:13:03,815
Right.

275
00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:06,320
The cause of this

276
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:07,908
is that you adventurers

277
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:11,298
defeated the Mobile Fortress Destroyer.

278
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,706
Destroyer?

279
00:13:13,734 --> 00:13:14,804
Do explain.

280
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:17,387
Generally speaking,
when the Destroyer appears,

281
00:13:17,388 --> 00:13:19,518
Lords will lose their land.

282
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:21,689
However,

283
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,929
with your desperate efforts,

284
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,529
this city did not come to that.

285
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:26,618
Isn't that a good thing?

286
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,023
The town itself was saved.

287
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:31,034
Yes, I mean the town itself.

288
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:34,226
But the granary areas along the way

289
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:37,227
were ravaged by all sorts of things.

290
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:40,299
Those farmers

291
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:42,419
have practically lost everything.

292
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:47,085
So they ran to the lord for help.

293
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:51,321
Yes, as you expected,

294
00:13:51,323 --> 00:13:53,310
this is what the lord said.

295
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:57,110
You should be grateful
that you're still alive.

296
00:13:57,111 --> 00:14:00,623
Even if left unattended,
weeds will still grow.

297
00:14:01,227 --> 00:14:02,033
Like that.

298
00:14:03,906 --> 00:14:06,313
It's impossible to describe it
as a natural disaster

299
00:14:06,315 --> 00:14:07,830
and have the people give up.

300
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,128
They cried and pleaded,

301
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,128
yes,

302
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,961
to the Dustiness family

303
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:14,717
who you know well.

304
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:17,518
This is what those people said.

305
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,342
The adventurers compensated

306
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:22,913
for the buildings destroyed by the flood.

307
00:14:22,914 --> 00:14:25,127
The benevolent Lady Dustiness,

308
00:14:25,128 --> 00:14:27,716
please pity us too.

309
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:28,618
Like this.

310
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:30,715
What did you just say?

311
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:32,914
About the buildings
destroyed by the flood.

312
00:14:35,425 --> 00:14:37,616
When they requested compensation from you,

313
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:38,929
they said

314
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:41,530
'I won't ask for full compensation,'

315
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:44,420
'but please compensate at least a part.'

316
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,721
The Dustiness family

317
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:49,118
lost more than half of their property

318
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,415
to compensate for the damage.

319
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,917
And that's not all.

320
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:57,128
To help those ravaged by the Destroyer,

321
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:00,006
they went to borrow money from the lord

322
00:15:00,007 --> 00:15:01,331
who disclaimed responsibility.

323
00:15:02,523 --> 00:15:04,336
The lord proposed an attached condition.

324
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:09,627
If you don't have money,

325
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:12,425
repay me with your body.

326
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:18,122
Kazuma.

327
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:21,221
Pounding the table must hurt.

328
00:15:21,222 --> 00:15:22,524
It hurts, doesn't it?

329
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:25,908
Then everything makes sense.

330
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:29,216
How much money does Darkness owe?

331
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,314
The property you own

332
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:35,529
plus the money in this bag

333
00:15:35,531 --> 00:15:38,211
amounts exactly to the debt.

334
00:15:40,813 --> 00:15:43,419
So, let's talk business.

335
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:51,425
Miss, you are very beautiful.

336
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:53,710
After the wedding,

337
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:56,715
please let the sick master

338
00:15:56,716 --> 00:15:59,122
take a look at you.

339
00:16:00,305 --> 00:16:01,705
Get lost!

340
00:16:01,706 --> 00:16:05,238
Lalatina is about to become mine anyway.

341
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:09,616
Only people from the Dustiness House
can pass through here.

342
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:11,018
Please go back.

343
00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:12,127
You fool!

344
00:16:12,128 --> 00:16:13,019
Listen.

345
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:13,998
After the wedding,

346
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:16,612
I will become your master.

347
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:18,518
I cannot let you pass.

348
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,512
You are not my master yet.

349
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:22,523
Wha…

350
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:25,726
I'll remember your face.

351
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:28,347
Just you wait after the wedding.

352
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:33,221
Can you ask the person outside to come in?

353
00:16:33,222 --> 00:16:34,326
I want to thank him.

354
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:35,607
Yes.

355
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:38,519
Please.

356
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,116
Well, well.

357
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:46,721
You are very beautiful.

358
00:16:47,828 --> 00:16:49,326
I'm sorry.

359
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:50,632
I will talk to him.

360
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:53,018
You will not be punished.

361
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:54,930
Please don't mind.

362
00:16:55,524 --> 00:16:57,913
Since he is approved by the young lady,

363
00:16:57,914 --> 00:16:59,523
I am willing to serve him.

364
00:17:01,112 --> 00:17:03,131
I approved, huh?

365
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:09,116
Seeing your smile

366
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:11,112
makes me feel very happy, young lady.

367
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:19,913
It might be a bit presumptuous.

368
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:22,419
You are so beautiful.

369
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,316
It's better not to play
intense games alone.

370
00:17:29,223 --> 00:17:30,429
Darn it.

371
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:33,529
It's all that man's fault
for imitating my voice.

372
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:40,919
A person born as a noble

373
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,314
does not have the right

374
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:44,419
to live as they please.

375
00:17:45,516 --> 00:17:46,716
Despite this,

376
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:50,424
I am fortunate to have lived up till now

377
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:52,514
with friends I can trust.

378
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:54,409
It's enough.

379
00:17:55,224 --> 00:17:57,435
To desire more would be greedy.

380
00:17:58,117 --> 00:18:01,521
Now it's my turn to repay
everyone in the town.

381
00:18:02,606 --> 00:18:03,617
Young lady?

382
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,201
Sorry.

383
00:18:05,776 --> 00:18:06,607
I'm fine.

384
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:11,727
What will they think once they
know the reason for my debt?

385
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:14,529
Megumin will probably get angry.

386
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:18,117
Aqua might burst into tears.

387
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,611
As for him,

388
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:22,314
he'll likely lecture me

389
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:24,101
that I've done a stupid thing.

390
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:27,309
Precisely the last thing I want him to do.

391
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,320
Carry it out then.

392
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,628
Will he come?

393
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,628
No, he won't come.

394
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:40,612
Given his personality,

395
00:18:40,614 --> 00:18:42,127
he's definitely sulking

396
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:44,118
alone at home.

397
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:50,216
It's time, young lady.

398
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:53,705
The priest blessing you today

399
00:18:53,706 --> 00:18:56,430
is the most influential person in town.

400
00:18:56,432 --> 00:19:00,310
This wedding will be great.

401
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:04,424
I'm so happy.

402
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:08,216
This year I spent with them,

403
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:11,018
I was so cheerful every day.

404
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,427
So happy.

405
00:19:20,508 --> 00:19:21,726
Don't push.

406
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,628
Can't see inside at all.

407
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:29,527
I wish you all the happiness, young lady.

408
00:20:33,588 --> 00:20:36,124
Bride Darkness

409
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:40,431
is soon to marry this guy who
looks like a bear and pig combined.

410
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:44,312
She follows a fate
not decided by me, a goddess,

411
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:47,224
and becomes his wife.

412
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:50,811
Do you swear that in health

413
00:20:50,812 --> 00:20:52,212
or sickness,

414
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:53,618
in happiness

415
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,217
or sadness,

416
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:56,509
in wealth

417
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,124
or poverty,

418
00:20:58,125 --> 00:20:59,927
you will love this old man,

419
00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:01,510
respect him,

420
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,416
comfort him,

421
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:05,307
help him,

422
00:21:05,308 --> 00:21:10,428
and be loyal to him for this life?

423
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,417
Calling me an old man?

424
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,516
You can't do it, can you?

425
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:18,509
Darkness, I want to go back with you,

426
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,625
eat the food made by Kazuma,

427
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:22,928
and then have a drink.

428
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,099
You… you're the woman who came to my house

429
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,918
and caused me a lot of trouble!

430
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:40,115
Dad, mom.

431
00:21:41,006 --> 00:21:43,807
You've always taught your darling son

432
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,913
to be an upright person.

433
00:21:46,621 --> 00:21:49,916
-I no longer know what a mundane life is.
-Go, Kazuma! Show him what you've got.

434
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:53,411
-I'm getting ready to fight the most powerful person in the area
-Go! Kazuma!

435
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:56,126
-and kidnap a noble young lady.
-Go! Show him!

436
00:21:57,424 --> 00:21:59,017
Let's go home, Darkness!

437
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:30,991
(Episode 11: Blessings for the Unchanging Daily Life)

438
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,596
Lord Demon King.

439
00:23:32,597 --> 00:23:33,503
We…

440
00:23:33,504 --> 00:23:34,882
We…

441
00:23:34,883 --> 00:23:38,288
are living on the beautiful Sanzu River.

442
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:40,060
We will keep enjoying it to the fullest.
