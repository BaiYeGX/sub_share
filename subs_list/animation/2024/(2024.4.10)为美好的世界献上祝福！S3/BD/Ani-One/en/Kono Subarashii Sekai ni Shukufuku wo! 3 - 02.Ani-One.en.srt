1
00:00:01,105 --> 00:00:03,003
Hmm… Princess.

2
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:06,011
She seems younger than me.

3
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:10,193
After we get to know each other well,
I hope she will call me "brother."

4
00:00:10,698 --> 00:00:12,005
Hey, Kazuma.

5
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:14,995
It is still not too late.

6
00:00:14,995 --> 00:00:16,505
Please turn down this matter.

7
00:00:16,902 --> 00:00:17,808
Okay?

8
00:00:17,808 --> 00:00:20,011
She is in charge of this nation.

9
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:21,510
Shut it up already!

10
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:23,796
You had the gall to disagree
with my proposal

11
00:00:23,797 --> 00:00:25,594
that I greet her in a kimono and hakama!

12
00:00:25,594 --> 00:00:26,985
How am I supposed
to meet her in those clothes,

13
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,604
which I have never heard of?

14
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:30,005
Listen.

15
00:00:30,005 --> 00:00:31,155
I will be dressing like this

16
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:32,302
until Princess Iris gets here,

17
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:35,495
so you should also wear formal clothes.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,906
Enough talk.

19
00:00:36,906 --> 00:00:39,396
This is the moment for you
to respond with "Yes, master".

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,802
Y-Yes, master.

21
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,604
I am a humble sow.

22
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,198
I did not ask you to say it over the top.

23
00:01:04,807 --> 00:01:09,104
(Konosuba S3)

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,494
(Episode 2: A Smile
for the Unsmiling Girl)

25
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:26,412
As expected,

26
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,698
the usual clothes make me feel safer.

27
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:31,412
I allowed it
because you begged me in tears.

28
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,005
After all, I am a noble.

29
00:02:34,006 --> 00:02:35,109
How could I dress like that?

30
00:02:35,109 --> 00:02:37,088
You were clearly snickering
behind my back.

31
00:02:37,089 --> 00:02:37,995
I was not.

32
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:41,308
Get moving, you two.

33
00:02:41,797 --> 00:02:43,705
Don't be so hasty.

34
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,406
There is a necessary task to
be carried out before meeting Princess.

35
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,318
The timing could not be better,
the goods have arrived just now.

36
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,010
The product
that you developed, Mr. Kazuma.

37
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:56,114
Without my help,
it couldn't have been done.

38
00:02:56,115 --> 00:02:57,198
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:02:57,604 --> 00:02:59,807
This is a useful tool in our country.

40
00:03:04,604 --> 00:03:06,609
This is very convenient.

41
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:08,905
This is sure to be a hit
with customers, Mr. Kazuma.

42
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:11,801
This Destroyer model
is also one of my proudest works.

43
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:14,099
This eliminates the need for flint.

44
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:16,203
I want one of these too.

45
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:18,098
You can have it.

46
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,197
I want one too, I want one too.

47
00:03:20,198 --> 00:03:21,609
Pfft, pfft, pfft.

48
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:23,401
It is only lighter,

49
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,099
so why are you excited about it?

50
00:03:25,604 --> 00:03:26,708
I'll take one too.

51
00:03:30,698 --> 00:03:31,604
What are you doing?

52
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,410
I would also like to pick one.

53
00:03:33,417 --> 00:03:34,895
No, you have to pay.

54
00:03:34,896 --> 00:03:36,505
Why?

55
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:38,416
Why can Darkness
and Megumin get it for free

56
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:39,713
but not me?

57
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:41,803
Because you did nothing, right?

58
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,806
Megumin helped with this.

59
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,504
Darkness connected me
to a major wholesaler's channel.

60
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:51,192
You do nothing but eat and sleep at home.

61
00:03:51,193 --> 00:03:54,407
Just go out and get customers
if you want it.

62
00:03:58,604 --> 00:04:00,813
Kazuma, you loser!

63
00:04:01,594 --> 00:04:03,504
You grabbed the clothes I took off to wash

64
00:04:03,505 --> 00:04:05,203
and sniffed desperately!

65
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,192
Initially, I was going
to help you conceal it!

66
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:10,817
You ungrateful wretch.

67
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,703
Hey, don't talk nonsense!

68
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,908
(Konosuba)
Please do not look at me that way.

69
00:04:17,605 --> 00:04:19,105
So, next…

70
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:22,996
Unbelievable as it may seem,

71
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:27,006
doves came out of this plain
handkerchief I pulled out.

72
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,396
What is she doing?

73
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,995
That's putting the cart before the horse.

74
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:36,401
Come on, perform some more.

75
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,803
Please, let me see something
more thrilling.

76
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:40,917
Please don't tip.

77
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:42,615
Because I'm not an artist.

78
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,409
Please don't tip.

79
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,410
Don't say that.

80
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,808
A tip of the hat to that wonderful trick.

81
00:04:49,196 --> 00:04:50,501
You bastard.

82
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:54,105
Are you not content to sprinkling holy
water on our shop's doorknob every day,

83
00:04:54,705 --> 00:04:57,615
to the point where you start openly
impeding our business operations?

84
00:04:57,616 --> 00:05:00,203
Stay out of my way, you strange mask guy.

85
00:05:00,204 --> 00:05:02,115
This is a public roadway.

86
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,907
What is the problem with performing here?

87
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:06,412
Shut up!

88
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:09,694
Today marks the debut of new merchandise
that is critical to the store.

89
00:05:09,694 --> 00:05:11,908
-Could you please not get in the way of business?
-Well… Listen.

90
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:13,595
Guys.

91
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,194
There is a new useful item
in our shop today.

92
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:19,611
Please come in and take a look.

93
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,360
(Konosuba)
Wiz is looking like

94
00:05:21,361 --> 00:05:22,403
(Konosuba)
a shop manager for the first time.

95
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:24,594
Darkness, let go of me.

96
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:26,506
Let me continue to perform.

97
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:29,604
-Thank you. Thank you.
-What is this?

98
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:32,901
-Two lighters and a Vanir mask, right?
-What is it? Wow, awesome.

99
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:34,417
Thank you.

100
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:38,407
Thank you again.

101
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:41,006
You restless lad, the vibe
with your traveling companions

102
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,506
was great, but after that,

103
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:44,093
there was zero movement.

104
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,001
D-Don't talk nonsense.

105
00:05:46,001 --> 00:05:47,797
I am certainly not restless.

106
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:49,803
Megumin, stop peeking at me all the time.

107
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:51,412
I certainly wasn't looking at you.

108
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:52,901
Don't waver now.

109
00:05:52,902 --> 00:05:56,100
How can the words of a demon
make you believe things that are not true?

110
00:05:56,793 --> 00:05:58,611
We should not talk about this.

111
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,297
Look at this grand scene.

112
00:06:00,298 --> 00:06:03,522
The 300 million Eris you deserve
will be credited to your account.

113
00:06:04,103 --> 00:06:05,699
As an apology for keeping you waiting,

114
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,798
I will give you this.

115
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,600
-What is this?
-So cool, so amazing.

116
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,308
-It's a mass-produced Vanir mask.
-So cool, so amazing.

117
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:11,923
-Wearing it under the moonlight, the mysterious
-So cool, so amazing.

118
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:13,912
-demonic power will enhance your magical power,
-So cool, so amazing.

119
00:06:13,913 --> 00:06:15,808
-improve blood circulation, smooth your skin,
-So cool, so amazing.

120
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,101
-and put you in excellent condition.
-So cool, so amazing.

121
00:06:18,798 --> 00:06:22,006
And this is one of the rarest,
the black mask.

122
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:24,303
You can show it off to the kids.

123
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,304
-From that day forward,
-I must perform this.

124
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:29,141
-Wiz's shop continues to thrive,
-Let me do it. Let me perform till the end.

125
00:06:29,142 --> 00:06:31,007
-going against the grain.
-Calm down, Aqua.

126
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:34,018
And finally…

127
00:06:36,895 --> 00:06:38,110
Alright, you two.

128
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:39,006
You know what to do, right?

129
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,507
Of course.

130
00:06:40,508 --> 00:06:43,011
I'll heat things up
with my best party show.

131
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:45,002
I won't let Darkness lose face.

132
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,203
I will also make a grand entrance

133
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:49,100
that will really surprise the princess.

134
00:06:49,413 --> 00:06:50,106
Kazuma.

135
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:51,494
Where should I buy something that produces

136
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,413
a smoky effect and fireworks?

137
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:56,605
-Are they really okay?
-I'll lend you my treasured smoke bombs.

138
00:06:56,606 --> 00:06:57,511
Great.

139
00:06:57,512 --> 00:06:59,001
-Hello, everyone.
-Thank you.

140
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:01,505
Today, I,

141
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,907
Lalatina Ford Dustiness,

142
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:05,912
will be in charge of leading you.

143
00:07:16,105 --> 00:07:18,500
This is too loose.

144
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:20,209
I think a bit tighter would be better.

145
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:22,413
T-There is no choice.

146
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:25,007
You can't hold up a knight's
clothes without muscles.

147
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:27,616
Megumin, what's wrong with you?

148
00:07:36,012 --> 00:07:37,101
I have no idea

149
00:07:38,093 --> 00:07:39,314
why it fell off so suddenly.

150
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:41,709
Isn't there a smaller size?

151
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:44,308
There is, but…

152
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,418
But that dress was worn by me
when I was a child…

153
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,693
It hurts.

154
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:51,350
Don't pull my braids.

155
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:53,084
Megumin, what is this?

156
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:56,002
Is not this a monster-repelling smoke bomb
and explosive potion?

157
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,402
(Konosuba)
Confiscated!

158
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:00,912
Look, look.

159
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,200
How is it?

160
00:08:02,597 --> 00:08:03,506
Oh.

161
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:06,600
Oh.

162
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:10,600
Stop staring at me.

163
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:12,116
Oh, oh.

164
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:14,105
Alright.

165
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:14,803
Listen up.

166
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:17,203
Behave nicely.

167
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:18,703
One wrong word

168
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:20,204
could give you the death penalty.

169
00:08:21,303 --> 00:08:22,293
What's the matter, Kazuma?

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,100
Let me tell you in advance.

171
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:30,204
If the Princess wants me to go with her,

172
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:32,522
I might think about moving.

173
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:35,407
Please be mentally prepared for this.

174
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:39,397
You view things too positively.

175
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:41,396
Listen.

176
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:43,908
I'll be responsible for
chatting with Princess Iris.

177
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,209
All you have to do is eat and

178
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,512
nod your head yes.

179
00:08:48,704 --> 00:08:49,714
So…

180
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:50,512
Let's go in.

181
00:08:58,303 --> 00:09:00,397
Princess Iris,
sorry for keeping you waiting.

182
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:02,806
They are both my friends

183
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,293
and my adventuring companions.

184
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,111
Satou Kazuma and his peers.

185
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:10,008
Truly unexpected.

186
00:09:12,006 --> 00:09:14,512
This world has not
disappointed my expectations.

187
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:16,306
It's indeed rare.

188
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:22,412
This is the first princess
of this country,

189
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:25,397
Princess Iris Stylish-Sword Belzerg.

190
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:26,913
You three,

191
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:28,913
greet the Princess.

192
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,204
I am Aqua, serving as the Archpriest.

193
00:09:38,803 --> 00:09:40,303
It is a pleasure to meet you.

194
00:09:43,105 --> 00:09:43,998
So

195
00:09:43,999 --> 00:09:46,397
as a greeting,
let me perform one of my talents.

196
00:09:46,397 --> 00:09:49,594
Please excuse me,
I have something to say to her.

197
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:50,996
Hey, let go of me!

198
00:09:50,996 --> 00:09:53,017
I'm about to perform
my best talent right now.

199
00:09:53,918 --> 00:09:55,802
A pleasure to meet you, Princess.

200
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:56,913
My name is Megu--

201
00:09:59,402 --> 00:10:01,692
Hey, didn't I say to behave properly?

202
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:02,595
Hey!

203
00:10:04,406 --> 00:10:05,298
That being said,

204
00:10:06,302 --> 00:10:08,204
Princess is really adorable!

205
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,803
Is she very shy?

206
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:13,798
Despicable fellow.

207
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,397
You must not stare at the royalty
with such impolite eyes.

208
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,704
Bow low, avoid making eye contact,

209
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:23,293
and then introduce yourself
and share your adventure tale.

210
00:10:23,997 --> 00:10:24,902
That's what Her Highness said.

211
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:25,808
I see.

212
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:29,902
Change!

213
00:10:30,204 --> 00:10:31,105
(Konosuba)
Princess Iris!

214
00:10:31,105 --> 00:10:32,193
My companions are too nervous.

215
00:10:32,194 --> 00:10:33,100
So they are a bit overexcited.

216
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:34,809
Please give me a moment.

217
00:10:35,105 --> 00:10:36,302
You jerk…

218
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,594
You jerk…

219
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,011
What does "change" mean?

220
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,203
This isn't what we agreed on, right?

221
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:43,599
That's my line.

222
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,412
I can't believe I've had expectations
from Her Highness.

223
00:10:45,413 --> 00:10:46,912
What's with that?

224
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:47,908
I was hoping she would say something like,

225
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:50,808
"I long for the world beyond,

226
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:52,191
O brave adventurer,

227
00:10:52,192 --> 00:10:55,406
let me hear your tales

228
00:10:55,407 --> 00:10:57,496
of adventure."

229
00:10:57,803 --> 00:10:59,698
With her attitude like that,
how are we going to eat together?

230
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:00,756
Is she looking down on me?

231
00:11:00,756 --> 00:11:02,204
It's done.

232
00:11:07,001 --> 00:11:08,599
As a symbol of friendship,

233
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,605
please accept this.

234
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:12,495
It is a masterpiece
that highlights every detail,

235
00:11:12,496 --> 00:11:14,506
including unkempt hair.

236
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:20,802
Princess Iris,

237
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:23,204
I will have these rude people
kicked out right away.

238
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:25,017
I-I'm sorry.

239
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:30,912
It is incredible that such
an outstanding sand painting

240
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:32,601
could be created in
such a short period of time.

241
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:34,108
And you even got Lalatina,

242
00:11:34,109 --> 00:11:35,808
who is usually quiet and calm,

243
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:38,021
to show a rare sign of stress.

244
00:11:38,022 --> 00:11:39,110
So it's alright.

245
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:40,006
That's what Her Highness said.

246
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:43,214
Then let us begin the meal.

247
00:11:53,095 --> 00:11:56,012
You must be the Cursed Sword Hero
that Mitsurugi mentioned, right?

248
00:11:56,506 --> 00:11:58,699
Tell me your story.

249
00:11:59,199 --> 00:12:00,095
That's what Her Highness said.

250
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,011
I would love to hear it too.

251
00:12:02,808 --> 00:12:05,515
The story of how
you impressed Mr. Mitsurugi.

252
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:09,913
Alright.

253
00:12:11,501 --> 00:12:14,793
In a later stage, I adjusted to
the circumstances and laid a trap,

254
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,501
using myself as bait

255
00:12:18,106 --> 00:12:20,309
to expose Sylvia's vulnerability.

256
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:25,996
Your style of fighting

257
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:28,303
is unlike anything I have ever heard of.

258
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:29,710
So far,

259
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:31,297
all the stories I have heard about heroes

260
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:34,496
have involved them vanquishing
monsters by themselves.

261
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:35,913
That's what Her Highness said.

262
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,106
My constant pursuit of personal growth

263
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:44,095
in the face of formidable challenges

264
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:47,097
is one way that I differ from them,

265
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:48,506
Princess.

266
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,902
A shut-in is talking nonsense.

267
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,199
Awesome.

268
00:12:55,694 --> 00:12:58,001
Just before you became an adventurer,
what did you do for a living?

269
00:12:58,593 --> 00:12:59,501
That's what Her Highness asked.

270
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,195
I am also interested.

271
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:02,606
Please tell us.

272
00:13:06,413 --> 00:13:07,699
Before I came to this country,

273
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:10,705
it was my job to watch over
my family as they came home.

274
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:13,101
Every day, I worked on
my skills in silence,

275
00:13:13,802 --> 00:13:15,194
keeping important places

276
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:17,012
safe from disaster.

277
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,506
However, nobody understood
or complimented me.

278
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:23,407
That is a tragic job.

279
00:13:25,407 --> 00:13:27,402
Is it similar to
the role of a castle guard?

280
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:29,813
It seems that you, too,
played a silent role

281
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:32,409
in protecting your hometown
from various disasters.

282
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:34,580
On occasion, I have to figure out
how to deal with individuals

283
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,997
who try to force me into contracts by
claiming that three months is sufficient.

284
00:13:37,907 --> 00:13:40,116
In short, a lot has happened.

285
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:41,501
Contracts?

286
00:13:42,006 --> 00:13:44,011
Did you repel the demon on your own?

287
00:13:44,505 --> 00:13:45,356
Home security…

288
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,001
(Konosuba)
I wasn't lying!

289
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:49,704
Just so you can beat Mr. Mitsurugi…

290
00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:51,604
Would you mind showing me

291
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:55,600
your adventurer card
so I can use it as a reference?

292
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,193
How could I possibly let her see

293
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:04,408
my personalized adventurer card?

294
00:14:04,409 --> 00:14:06,093
I would be exposed in an instant

295
00:14:06,094 --> 00:14:08,408
if she asked me,
"Where did you learn Lich?"

296
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,100
Asking an adventurer to reveal
his card seems inappropriate.

297
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:14,006
Rather than that…

298
00:14:14,006 --> 00:14:14,798
Aqua,

299
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:16,407
it is time for you
to show off your big talent.

300
00:14:16,407 --> 00:14:18,599
I drew a lovely sand painting.

301
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,698
I am done for the day.

302
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:20,491
Hey!

303
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,406
Bring over some more bubble wine.

304
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:23,913
-Bring it here quickly.
-I won't tell anyone.

305
00:14:24,611 --> 00:14:25,517
Or

306
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:28,111
is it do you have a reason
not to let other people see it?

307
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,100
There is indeed a reason
not to show it to others.

308
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,303
The job this person has is the weakest,

309
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:37,304
and he might be
too embarrassed to tell you this.

310
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:39,908
T-That's how it is.

311
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,600
What you just said raises suspicions.

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,996
Did you really defeat Mr. Mitsurugi?

313
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:47,402
I can't tell her that

314
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:48,803
I won by using Steal

315
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:51,308
to steal his Cursed Sword.

316
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:01,900
Um…

317
00:15:02,801 --> 00:15:04,610
I find it hard to believe that someone

318
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:06,501
from the lowest profession could

319
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,488
defeat Mr. Mitsurugi,
the Swordsmanship Master.

320
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:10,408
Are you deceiving me?

321
00:15:11,095 --> 00:15:12,911
And he is very handsome.

322
00:15:13,309 --> 00:15:14,200
That's what Her Highness said.

323
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,594
I think so too.

324
00:15:16,595 --> 00:15:17,907
He is very handsome.

325
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:19,793
Hey, you guys!

326
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,303
I'd beat you up!

327
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:23,204
Insolent man!

328
00:15:23,204 --> 00:15:25,605
How dare you address
the royal family as "you guys"?

329
00:15:26,194 --> 00:15:29,402
Saying things that invite mockery,

330
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:31,308
then becoming enraged when someone mocks.

331
00:15:33,501 --> 00:15:34,600
I am very sorry.

332
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:37,907
After all, he lacks manners.

333
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:42,793
For my sake,

334
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:44,194
please forgive him for being rude.

335
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,980
Considering Dustiness's significant impact

336
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,709
on our nation,

337
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,809
I will refrain from pursuing it.

338
00:15:55,303 --> 00:15:57,313
But I feel very disappointed.

339
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:00,101
I will reward you for telling me
an adventure story.

340
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:03,303
Please accept your reward
and depart immediately,

341
00:16:03,304 --> 00:16:04,997
you con artist from the lowest profession.

342
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,006
That's what Her Highness said.

343
00:16:06,303 --> 00:16:08,105
My goodness, that is excessive.

344
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,011
But thanks to Darkness,

345
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,111
I was saved.

346
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,011
Hurry back.

347
00:16:16,996 --> 00:16:17,996
That hurts.

348
00:16:18,496 --> 00:16:19,995
Hey, Megumin, what are you doing?

349
00:16:19,996 --> 00:16:21,600
Stop it.

350
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,204
Hey.

351
00:16:24,303 --> 00:16:25,698
Not good.

352
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:27,814
Megumin prioritizes companions the most.

353
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:30,704
If someone picks a fight,
she will surely retaliate.

354
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:36,803
Strange.

355
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:40,704
I was worried that
you would definitely be mad.

356
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,318
If it were just me,

357
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:45,100
I would not endure it.

358
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:47,212
It would be hard for you, Darkness,

359
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:48,902
if I got mad here, right?

360
00:16:54,605 --> 00:16:55,596
Princess Iris.

361
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:58,918
Could you take back

362
00:16:59,401 --> 00:17:00,996
what you said about him
being a con artist?

363
00:17:02,802 --> 00:17:05,698
This man has not lied,

364
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,105
despite his exaggerated claims.

365
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,297
Furthermore, in times of crisis,

366
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:11,695
he is more dependable than anybody else,

367
00:17:11,696 --> 00:17:13,699
even though his profession is the weakest.

368
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,700
Princess Iris, I implore you

369
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,099
to retract your previous statement

370
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,303
and offer an apology to him.

371
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:24,304
Lord Dustiness!

372
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,204
I won't apologize!

373
00:17:29,995 --> 00:17:31,709
Since you said he was not lying,

374
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,601
ask him to describe

375
00:17:32,602 --> 00:17:35,412
how he beat Mr. Mitsurugi.

376
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:37,305
If he can't do that,

377
00:17:37,305 --> 00:17:38,485
he is weak

378
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:39,606
and just a blowhard con artist--

379
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:45,704
What are you doing, Lord Dustiness?

380
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:47,898
No!

381
00:17:55,793 --> 00:17:56,710
Princess Iris.

382
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:02,913
I'm sorry.

383
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,600
However, you should not
speak ill of someone

384
00:18:06,006 --> 00:18:09,694
who fought bravely and achieved so much.

385
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:11,793
He is under no obligation

386
00:18:11,794 --> 00:18:15,512
to explain to you how he defeated
the Cursed Sword Guy.

387
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:19,013
And even if he lost,

388
00:18:19,508 --> 00:18:21,506
you still have no right
to scold him severely.

389
00:18:27,907 --> 00:18:29,798
Alright, I understand.

390
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:32,401
My companion is obviously
trying to protect me,

391
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:34,209
so I can't remain silent.

392
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:36,902
Despite its lack of grace,

393
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:38,512
I will show you

394
00:18:39,007 --> 00:18:40,910
how I defeated Mitsurugi.

395
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:44,204
Enough.

396
00:18:44,511 --> 00:18:46,511
Claire, I'm alright now.

397
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:49,204
Why has her attitude taken
such a complete and utter turn?

398
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:51,517
Maybe her actual character
is not so terrible.

399
00:18:53,407 --> 00:18:55,214
Given your willingness,
I will not intervene.

400
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:56,717
Go ahead, Kazuma.

401
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,507
You shouldn't lose to her, right?

402
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:01,699
Of course not.

403
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,210
Think about the opponents
I've faced before.

404
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,894
Cursed Sword Guy
and the leaders of the Devil King's Army.

405
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:09,324
And those hefty reward targets.

406
00:19:09,793 --> 00:19:12,215
I usually fight such opponents.

407
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:15,506
I am going to steal that dangerous sword.

408
00:19:15,897 --> 00:19:16,996
Eat this!

409
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:20,006
Steal!

410
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:23,699
Alright. Now I'm going to--

411
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,709
Sorry, this…

412
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:30,704
Please take this back.

413
00:19:36,012 --> 00:19:37,198
-You jerk!
-I'm sorry!

414
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:38,600
-You jerk!
-I'm sorry!

415
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,990
Why can't you do it right?

416
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:42,210
I'm sorry.

417
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:44,105
Um…

418
00:19:44,603 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm very sorry.

419
00:19:46,001 --> 00:19:47,209
Please don't mind it.

420
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:49,105
After all, the wound has healed.

421
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,714
It's best to pretend it never happened.

422
00:19:51,095 --> 00:19:51,798
Nonetheless,

423
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,809
I was genuinely surprised that
she managed to heal that wound flawlessly.

424
00:19:55,506 --> 00:19:57,720
And, Lord Dustiness,
your unwavering attitude.

425
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:00,799
Plus, this individual is none other
than the famous Crimson Demon.

426
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:02,604
If it were you,

427
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:05,105
it would make sense to be able to repel
the leaders of the Devil King's Army.

428
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:09,308
As for Mr. Kazuma…

429
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,710
What makes you look at me with doubt?

430
00:20:21,204 --> 00:20:23,709
It would be better
if you told him that yourself.

431
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:25,306
Don't worry.

432
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:26,793
Mr. Kazuma appears helpless

433
00:20:26,794 --> 00:20:29,803
against someone
like Princess Iris, you see.

434
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:33,517
It seems they are talking
about something rude.

435
00:20:46,902 --> 00:20:49,314
Apologies for earlier
labeling you as a con artist.

436
00:20:49,694 --> 00:20:50,725
Can you tell me

437
00:20:53,595 --> 00:20:56,803
some more adventure stories?

438
00:21:01,604 --> 00:21:02,511
Sure.

439
00:21:06,496 --> 00:21:08,408
Then it is time to return to the castle.

440
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,913
Princess Iris.

441
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,304
Let us talk more when we visit

442
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:13,522
the royal capital.

443
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:16,006
Farewell.

444
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,698
Then, Princess,

445
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:20,798
see you next time.

446
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:23,406
Tele…

447
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,700
-What are you saying?
-port

448
00:21:26,199 --> 00:21:26,992
What?

449
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:40,600
P-Princess Iris?

450
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,705
Um…What's going on?

451
00:21:46,808 --> 00:21:48,203
Did not you say

452
00:21:48,204 --> 00:21:50,918
you would tell me more adventure stories?

453
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:55,022
Worthy of being the leader of the nobles.

454
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:59,308
That's a hell of a way to behave.

455
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:33,200
(Episode 3: Re-Educate this Arrogant Girl)

456
00:23:33,201 --> 00:23:35,003
Long time no see, Devil King.

457
00:23:35,496 --> 00:23:37,810
I am the Deadly Poison Slime, Hans.

458
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:39,804
I started selling something called

459
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:41,554
"Slime Red Bean Soup" at
Sanzu River not long ago…
