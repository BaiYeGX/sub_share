1
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:10,510
Kazuma!

2
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,100
I am Kazuma.

3
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:13,510
How embarrassing. You actually died.

4
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:15,704
You're so excited.

5
00:00:16,307 --> 00:00:18,307
I have always wanted to say it once.

6
00:00:18,308 --> 00:00:19,505
Kazuma!

7
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:20,396
I am Kazuma.

8
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:22,302
Your body has been revived!

9
00:00:22,303 --> 00:00:23,606
Come back quickly!

10
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:25,411
Darkness is really sad for no reason

11
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:27,505
and has a bad smell.

12
00:00:27,506 --> 00:00:30,001
Come back quickly, come back!

13
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:37,161
Mr. Kazuma, welcome back.

14
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,902
It stinks!

15
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:41,008
What happened to my clothes?

16
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:43,708
It's all melted.

17
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:46,870
Only this strangely named sword is left.

18
00:00:47,204 --> 00:00:48,006
What?

19
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,005
The name I chose for the sword
is strange, you say?

20
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:52,506
I can't just listen to that.

21
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:55,803
Darkness.

22
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:57,027
Lady Eris told me about it.

23
00:00:57,797 --> 00:00:59,005
To save me,

24
00:00:59,006 --> 00:01:01,006
you got eaten by the water snake?

25
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:06,912
That is not like you at all.

26
00:01:08,197 --> 00:01:10,697
Okay, let us go home
and take a bath immediately.

27
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:12,401
Hey, Kazuma.

28
00:01:12,402 --> 00:01:14,255
It does not seem right
to ask her to take a bath

29
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:15,588
when you are not dressed.

30
00:01:15,589 --> 00:01:16,993
Are you a pervert?

31
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:20,000
Are you a pervert?

32
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,037
(Konosuba S3)

33
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:54,590
(Episode 8: Eternal Rest to The Lord of This Lake)
Okay, quickly take a bath.

34
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,092
Kazuma, if you keep dressing like that,

35
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:57,593
people will call the cops.

36
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,514
Shut up!

37
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:00,910
There is no need to worry
about that water snake over there, right?

38
00:03:01,494 --> 00:03:05,503
It should be busy polluting
the lake water for now.

39
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:08,217
I am the one who purified the lake.

40
00:03:08,218 --> 00:03:10,189
Aqua, when you are overconfident,

41
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,301
a trap is likely to be lurking around.

42
00:03:13,207 --> 00:03:15,403
Geez, I can't stand you.

43
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:16,503
If you continue to utter crazy things,

44
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:18,487
I will have Kazuma or Darkness carry you.

45
00:03:18,488 --> 00:03:20,508
I apologize, please don't do that!

46
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:21,717
Please!

47
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:23,706
Then let's go.

48
00:03:23,707 --> 00:03:27,399
We should do our best to show off
our accomplishments to other people.

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,102
Therefore, we could get some money

50
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,405
even if we do not get the prize
for being subdued.

51
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:34,213
Leave it to me!

52
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,590
Let me tell you more

53
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,004
about how strong my explosion magic is!

54
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,691
Aqua told me that

55
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:47,201
the water snake who ate me

56
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,416
seems to have turned me
into a baby Kazuma.

57
00:03:53,603 --> 00:03:56,900
It should have gone back
to its original size, right?

58
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:58,801
Kazuma.

59
00:03:58,801 --> 00:03:59,400
Yes?

60
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,004
I'm baby Kazuma.

61
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:01,490
You took a long bath.

62
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,597
Could it be that you are hurting?

63
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:04,410
I-I'm fine.

64
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,097
It smells awful, do not you think?

65
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:07,843
That is why I wanted to wash it off well.

66
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:10,916
Hey, Kazuma.

67
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,915
Um…

68
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:13,706
I am sorry that my request
this time was too much.

69
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:15,905
Stop talking about the past.

70
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,998
Aqua and Megumin are probably
eating fancy food at the guild.

71
00:04:19,999 --> 00:04:21,504
Let us hurry over too.

72
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,597
Alright, you're right.

73
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,605
Then I will leave these clothes here
for you to change into.

74
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:33,500
Hey.

75
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:36,194
Do you need to beat water snake
for some reason?

76
00:04:36,802 --> 00:04:37,501
Wha--

77
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:39,297
No!

78
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:41,401
-It seems there is a reason.
-No, how could there be?

79
00:04:41,402 --> 00:04:42,995
Despite failing today,

80
00:04:42,996 --> 00:04:44,901
let us plan ahead for the next time

81
00:04:44,902 --> 00:04:47,001
we try to beat that water snake.

82
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,500
What's up with you?

83
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:51,058
You made a big deal out

84
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,708
of saying you would keep people safe,

85
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,401
but you gave up so fast.

86
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:57,599
Idiot, who do you think I am?

87
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,089
It is the duty

88
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,407
of the Dustiness family
to safeguard the populace!

89
00:05:01,408 --> 00:05:04,408
I will kill that water snake
the next time!

90
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:12,558
Why are you so prone
to doing pointless things?

91
00:05:12,559 --> 00:05:16,607
You dare to anger the fierce water snake!

92
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,912
Oh my, Megumin!

93
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:20,314
Do you have any idea what kind
of trouble you got into?

94
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,199
Kazuma!

95
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:26,910
Why are they mad?

96
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,787
Were we not supposed to vanquish it

97
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,498
with a determination to perish
before the knights came?

98
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,693
Because something very
big happened in the royal capital.

99
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:37,712
The royal capital?

100
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,007
Brother.

101
00:05:41,001 --> 00:05:42,901
Hey, is the royal capital in danger?

102
00:05:42,902 --> 00:05:45,506
Is my dear sister in danger?

103
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:50,006
The royal castle has been broken
into by a group of thieves

104
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:52,011
called the Silver-Haired Thieves.

105
00:05:52,012 --> 00:05:54,198
The knights have been sent to catch them

106
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,506
because they stole treasures.

107
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,693
How is this possible?

108
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,657
I am also being sought after along with
the leaders of the Devil King Army.

109
00:06:03,658 --> 00:06:05,302
If this city gets

110
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:07,996
the royal capital's wanted order,
it means…

111
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:10,110
I am only telling you this.

112
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:12,407
They asked a fortune-teller
from the Crimson Demon Village

113
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:15,096
to help them figure out
where the criminal is.

114
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,901
-The target with a 200 million reward
- No…it's not like that.

115
00:06:17,902 --> 00:06:20,298
-is surprisingly in Axel City.
-Don't make such a scary face.

116
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,037
200 million?

117
00:06:22,038 --> 00:06:23,797
Hey, is that true?

118
00:06:23,798 --> 00:06:26,199
That must make more money
than killing monsters.

119
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,297
Exactly.

120
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:29,797
-The Silver-Haired Thieves
-We really need money, so we have to do it.

121
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:31,105
are in this city?

122
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:32,797
200 million Eris…

123
00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:34,199
200 million Eris, huh?

124
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:38,402
Hey, why are you looking at me?

125
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,094
If you capture the Silver-Haired Thieves,

126
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:45,137
the knights can come to Axel
and conquer the water snake.

127
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:46,797
That's how it is.

128
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:49,506
We need your help, Mr. Kazuma.

129
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,401
O-Of course, I'll help.

130
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:55,668
Konosuba.

131
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:58,792
Good night, dragon.

132
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:03,792
-My plan is to hide at home, of course.
-Good dragon.

133
00:07:03,793 --> 00:07:07,907
After you are born,

134
00:07:07,908 --> 00:07:10,907
-I will raise you.
-Hey, what are you doing?

135
00:07:10,908 --> 00:07:12,059
Prenatal education.

136
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,814
Right?

137
00:07:14,397 --> 00:07:16,797
There is no need for you
to keep looking after it.

138
00:07:16,798 --> 00:07:19,308
It should stay warm if you put it
in front of the stove, right?

139
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,497
You can eat it as a snack
if it gets too done.

140
00:07:22,204 --> 00:07:23,006
Hey!

141
00:07:23,007 --> 00:07:25,404
Be careful,
or I'll feed you a sacred punch!

142
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,995
I am giving it magical power.

143
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:31,408
He's going to be the leader of the dragon.

144
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,198
I want to give it everything

145
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,605
because I am its mother.

146
00:07:36,606 --> 00:07:37,809
Right, Jelteman?

147
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,496
You really did pick such a bad name.

148
00:07:40,809 --> 00:07:41,595
Kazuma!

149
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:42,595
The key is firepower!

150
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,605
We should fight until
the water snake is gone

151
00:07:44,606 --> 00:07:46,804
if we cannot get rid of it in one shot.

152
00:07:46,805 --> 00:07:47,995
What?

153
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:50,610
Like when we were fighting
the mobile fortress destroyer.

154
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:51,804
With Aqua's power

155
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,287
and Kazuma's Drain Touch,
we can defeat it.

156
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:54,897
I don't want to.

157
00:07:54,897 --> 00:07:55,892
Huh?

158
00:07:56,606 --> 00:08:00,907
Why do I have to take
this dirty Lich skill?

159
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:02,401
I can't just give away

160
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:05,511
my holy magical power to anyone.

161
00:08:05,512 --> 00:08:07,194
I am not going to do it,

162
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,988
not even if Kazuma threatens me,

163
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,401
Darkness treats me well,

164
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:11,667
or Megumin goes crazy!

165
00:08:11,668 --> 00:08:12,512
Huh?

166
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:14,002
So, Megumin,

167
00:08:14,003 --> 00:08:16,605
why do you want
to get back at it so badly?

168
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:22,099
Because it killed you.

169
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,412
Naturally, I want to get revenge
on it personally.

170
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:27,210
I-I see.

171
00:08:29,707 --> 00:08:31,308
From then on,

172
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:33,006
I used Darkness's Decoy,

173
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,912
cast Explosion on it, and then ran away

174
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:36,636
every day to bother it.

175
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:40,302
Couldn't we find
a more effective solution?

176
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:42,605
Darkness, what are you doing?

177
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:44,907
Shouldn't you be the one to stop her now?

178
00:08:44,908 --> 00:08:46,191
B-But…

179
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,907
No matter what,
I want to beat that water snake.

180
00:08:48,908 --> 00:08:53,194
Also, this makes water snake's
magic less strong.

181
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,418
These two…

182
00:08:55,895 --> 00:08:56,703
Anyway,

183
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,297
it is not going to happen
while it is still raining, right?

184
00:08:58,298 --> 00:09:00,412
It would only be good for it.

185
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:03,996
The weather report says
it will rain for a while longer.

186
00:09:04,601 --> 00:09:06,908
I will get serious
when the weather gets better.

187
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:14,506
Do you mean you are
not going to be serious now?

188
00:09:14,507 --> 00:09:16,302
What are you doing? Stop it!

189
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:17,792
Give Chomusuke back to me!

190
00:09:17,793 --> 00:09:19,203
Bastard, let go of it quickly!

191
00:09:19,204 --> 00:09:21,209
Believe it or not, I will hurt you
if you do not let go!

192
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:35,397
-It kept raining for days on end.
-Explosion, explosion.

193
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,993
Darkness and Megumin were the only ones

194
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,506
-who kept going after the water snake.
- Explosion, explosion.

195
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,703
We're home.

196
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:44,599
Darkness is in a pretty messy state.

197
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,996
Please take her to bathe.

198
00:09:48,108 --> 00:09:50,590
It's too dangerous.
You guys shouldn't go there anymore.

199
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:52,599
That snake

200
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,198
sneaked up on us,
maybe because it can't stand

201
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,600
the constant explosion.

202
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:59,292
Megumin just barely used magic to hit it.

203
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:01,809
During its process of neck regeneration,
we managed to flee.

204
00:10:03,602 --> 00:10:05,793
It is really hard to deal with.

205
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,496
Aqua, thank you.

206
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:32,912
You are a dragon.

207
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:37,302
An awesome dragon.

208
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,901
But your mom, who is me,

209
00:10:40,902 --> 00:10:43,308
-Kazuma, what are you doing?
- is blue.

210
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,698
I'm fixing it for you since I have
too much time on my hands.

211
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:46,600
-It's raining outside anyway.
-Even with the padding,

212
00:10:46,601 --> 00:10:50,193
-I have nothing to do, either.
-Even with the padding,

213
00:10:50,194 --> 00:10:53,902
-Don't go back there after I fixed it, okay?
-Eris's breast remains flat.

214
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,292
When we went to

215
00:10:56,293 --> 00:10:58,297
the hot springs together,

216
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:00,397
you also helped me
repair my armor, didn't you?

217
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:03,599
I would like to go to the hot springs
with you guys again.

218
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,663
I don't want to.

219
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,094
I hate that city.

220
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:08,402
Everyone there is as strange as Megumin.

221
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:10,292
Hey, what do you mean by that?

222
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:11,798
Let's be clear about this.

223
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:12,596
Hey.

224
00:11:12,597 --> 00:11:14,006
What is up with saying such hurtful things

225
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,480
about my cute believers?

226
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:16,605
Aqua, how can you say that?

227
00:11:16,606 --> 00:11:19,011
What on earth do you mean?
Let's be clear about this.

228
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,105
My believers

229
00:11:20,106 --> 00:11:21,913
are all earnest and well-behaved.

230
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:23,313
-Are you implying
-Despite this,

231
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,897
-that I am not earnest and well-behaved?
-I still want to go.

232
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:32,412
Kazuma, Darkness has disappeared!

233
00:11:32,413 --> 00:11:34,205
She vanished along with her armor!

234
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:35,995
That fellow…

235
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:38,011
I told her not to go!

236
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:39,792
It is too perilous to go alone!

237
00:11:39,793 --> 00:11:41,199
Really!

238
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,730
She is really a pain.

239
00:11:43,109 --> 00:11:44,995
I will leave Wiz to take care of the egg.

240
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,111
Let's go teach Darkness a lesson.

241
00:11:50,996 --> 00:11:54,412
Go stop Darkness first, Aqua and Megumin.

242
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:55,502
How about you?

243
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:57,802
I have to go somewhere.

244
00:11:57,803 --> 00:12:00,308
We can't let her fight by herself.

245
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:02,017
Damn her.

246
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:05,101
She makes me mad!

247
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:10,804
Ominous sky.

248
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:13,803
My old wounds have begun to hurt.

249
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,694
Let me go!

250
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,599
Seriously, I can't stand you!

251
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,891
You can't do it alone.

252
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:23,803
You do not want to go back halfway

253
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,703
because you think we will scold you?

254
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,995
I am not going to get mad.
Come on, go back.

255
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:30,000
Seriously, what is wrong with you?

256
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:31,209
We have teamed up.

257
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,193
Tell us the reason.

258
00:12:33,194 --> 00:12:34,802
I…

259
00:12:34,803 --> 00:12:36,402
Even if it is not possible…

260
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:41,204
Darkness.

261
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:43,736
Hey, wait for us.

262
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:49,017
Darkness.

263
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,195
What's going on?

264
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:53,241
Lalatina!

265
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:55,502
Don't call me Lalatina!

266
00:12:55,503 --> 00:12:57,303
-What are you doing?
-Hey, Lalatina, do not say that.

267
00:12:57,304 --> 00:12:58,512
-If it is a new trick,
-We refuse to let our pal Lalatina

268
00:12:58,513 --> 00:13:00,152
-I have other ideas.
-act on her own.

269
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:01,613
No, it is not it.

270
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,781
I am merely telling everyone

271
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,902
that you go to deal
with the water snake every day

272
00:13:04,903 --> 00:13:07,205
and ask them if they can help.

273
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,501
Recently, Kazuma has been
buying us dinner a lot.

274
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:15,012
We ought to be able
to pay him back a little.

275
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:18,393
After all, we might as well listen
to your vague wishes, Lalatina.

276
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,690
Alright, look.

277
00:13:22,598 --> 00:13:26,298
So many adventurers have come for you.

278
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,099
We do not like how stubborn you are,

279
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,018
but you should not worry them.

280
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,007
Everyone…

281
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:35,111
Oh my, Lalatina

282
00:13:35,112 --> 00:13:36,393
is blushing!

283
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:39,820
(Konosuba)

284
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:42,904
Blessing.

285
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,199
Blessing.

286
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,596
Blessing.

287
00:13:47,392 --> 00:13:49,402
Thieves, prepare Bind.

288
00:13:49,403 --> 00:13:52,267
For archers, get your grappling
hook-equipped shots ready.

289
00:13:52,268 --> 00:13:53,803
Our opponent is a water snake.

290
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:55,106
Do not be careless, okay?

291
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:56,003
Okay!

292
00:13:56,393 --> 00:13:58,742
There is no need for magicians
to save a second shot.

293
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:03,007
Gather all your magical might
and get ready for a massive one!

294
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,402
Leave it to me!

295
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:06,397
I will definitely employ Explosion

296
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:08,903
to dispel that water snake this time.

297
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,013
And then, Darkness,

298
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,147
your Decoy is the key to victory.

299
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:16,396
Do not be easily defeated, okay?

300
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,304
Okay.

301
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,191
Okay.

302
00:14:20,005 --> 00:14:21,294
Let's go!

303
00:14:24,607 --> 00:14:27,673
Blessing.

304
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:28,799
Darkness!

305
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,404
Leave it to me!

306
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,914
Decoy!

307
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,195
I'm going to kill you!

308
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:51,189
Good, thieves' skill squad!

309
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,600
Bind!

310
00:14:57,002 --> 00:14:59,106
Go!

311
00:14:59,107 --> 00:14:59,940
Thump!

312
00:15:10,303 --> 00:15:11,401
The wind direction is fine.

313
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:12,569
Visibility is clear.

314
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,704
A bit higher.

315
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,490
That's right.

316
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,100
Very good, stop.

317
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:20,408
Fire!

318
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,595
Got it!

319
00:15:29,906 --> 00:15:31,479
Pull hard, pull hard!

320
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,495
Pull hard, pull hard!

321
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,006
Harder!

322
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,485
Is this truly okay, Kazuma?

323
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:44,705
Yes, just go for it!

324
00:15:44,706 --> 00:15:46,397
Okay!

325
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,365
It is impossible to beat
until its magic power is gone.

326
00:15:57,366 --> 00:15:58,974
Let me drain it then.

327
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,480
Drain Touch!

328
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:09,593
We can do it!

329
00:16:09,594 --> 00:16:12,292
We can do it!

330
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:19,793
Worked!

331
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,209
Kazuma!

332
00:16:29,798 --> 00:16:30,860
Everyone!

333
00:16:38,501 --> 00:16:40,406
This is really Miss Dustiness.

334
00:16:40,407 --> 00:16:43,203
Seriously, you have amazing
wrist strength and endurance.

335
00:16:43,204 --> 00:16:44,615
Is this the right time to say this?

336
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:47,110
Things can't go like this

337
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:48,120
I can't hold on anymore.

338
00:16:48,121 --> 00:16:49,906
Idiot, hold on for me!

339
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:50,907
You have to hold on!

340
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:54,005
Drain Touch!

341
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:57,182
-Every day, Darkness hurts herself
-Drain Touch!

342
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,120
-to lessen this snake magic power.
-Drain Touch!

343
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:01,407
-How can I let her work go to waste?
-Drain Touch!

344
00:17:04,194 --> 00:17:05,163
I can't hold on anymore.

345
00:17:05,164 --> 00:17:06,293
Hey!

346
00:17:06,294 --> 00:17:09,298
You rarely help,
but now you have a chance to shine,

347
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:10,527
and then you are out
of the game so quickly?

348
00:17:12,204 --> 00:17:13,807
You can't hold on even like this.

349
00:17:13,808 --> 00:17:16,016
Are you able to win
an endurance contest back-to-back?

350
00:17:16,017 --> 00:17:17,512
You're such a weakling.

351
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:19,913
Being scolded by a mean man

352
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,902
while being pressed hard
by the water snake

353
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:23,897
was…

354
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:26,194
a truly wonderful reward!

355
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:27,921
Pull! Pull!

356
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,505
Darkness can't hold on any longer.

357
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,391
Don't underestimate
the adventurers of Axel!

358
00:17:32,392 --> 00:17:33,511
Everyone…

359
00:17:34,802 --> 00:17:37,396
Don't worry, Kazuma.

360
00:17:37,397 --> 00:17:38,901
I will die with you.

361
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:40,600
Could I not be worried?

362
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,412
Don't give up!

363
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:44,698
How could you die from being pressed
by a water snake when you are so strong?

364
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:47,400
I am the only one
who will die from being crushed!

365
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:48,401
Wha--

366
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:53,105
Kazuma is going to die if I give up now?

367
00:17:55,595 --> 00:17:56,996
What is this feeling?

368
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:06,406
Although you act like my lord
and urge me to hold on,

369
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:10,199
your life is in my hands.

370
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,011
What a contradiction.

371
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:15,995
Who really is the lord in this case?

372
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:17,297
This is something new for me.

373
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:19,194
This is something new for me, Kazuma!

374
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:28,900
Has the water snake weakened?

375
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,297
I will take the heavyweight reward target!

376
00:18:32,298 --> 00:18:34,995
The reward money goes
to the person who kills it!

377
00:18:34,996 --> 00:18:37,599
Hey, what are you talking about?

378
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,604
I won't share with anyone--

379
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:43,901
Duster!

380
00:18:43,902 --> 00:18:46,808
Light of Saber!

381
00:18:49,407 --> 00:18:50,595
Hey, look!

382
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,292
Its head is not growing back.

383
00:18:53,293 --> 00:18:56,100
Magicians!

384
00:18:56,699 --> 00:18:58,604
The sound of impending doom,

385
00:18:58,605 --> 00:18:59,902
the cries that will soon erupt,

386
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:04,407
-is the roar that will guide us to triumph.
-Get out of here before the explosion happens!

387
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,698
The smoke of the end

388
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:08,606
is rising right now.

389
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,297
And it will soon transform into a bouquet

390
00:19:11,298 --> 00:19:13,407
to be offered to him in heaven
as an offering.

391
00:19:15,105 --> 00:19:16,396
I want to avenge Kazuma!

392
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:18,199
Hey, I'm still alive, you know!

393
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:21,501
Explosion!

394
00:19:35,095 --> 00:19:36,307
But I didn't think

395
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,094
it would really work out.

396
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:40,407
Give Kazuma and his friends
a little extra bonus, okay?

397
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:41,995
I truly hope they can seize the urge
to monopolize the bonus

398
00:19:41,996 --> 00:19:44,407
and take away the portion
of that guy who wanted to flee.

399
00:19:45,288 --> 00:19:47,198
It might be best not to
let him revive at all.

400
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:49,182
How do you feel
after defeating the water snake

401
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:50,198
you have been longing for?

402
00:19:50,199 --> 00:19:51,902
Can this make you sleep well?

403
00:19:52,806 --> 00:19:53,611
Yes.

404
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:55,807
I no longer have to worry
about anything because of you.

405
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:58,104
I am not even sure
what I was worrying about.

406
00:19:58,105 --> 00:19:59,798
I believe that my former self
was quite foolish.

407
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:04,907
However, this is not due to
defeating the water snake.

408
00:20:05,407 --> 00:20:06,599
-Now I know for sure.
-Hey, that's my doing, right?

409
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,709
-I really do like the people in this place.
-It's thanks to Lady Aqua, right?

410
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,420
-I won't be lost anymore.
-You're so crooked.

411
00:20:13,602 --> 00:20:15,996
You say some stupid things
without thinking about it.

412
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:21,210
Life is good for me.

413
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:26,198
Hey, show me more respect!

414
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:28,896
I should be thanked
for bringing you back to life.

415
00:20:28,897 --> 00:20:30,709
Admire me a bit more!

416
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:31,802
Hey, Kazuma!

417
00:20:31,803 --> 00:20:32,402
The priest on your team

418
00:20:32,403 --> 00:20:34,418
has been a pain since just now.

419
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:40,694
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

420
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,410
Darkness, are you home?

421
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:47,111
Oh, she does not seem to be here.

422
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,870
She is probably in her room.

423
00:20:48,871 --> 00:20:49,710
Okay.

424
00:20:49,711 --> 00:20:51,708
Let us continue drinking
in our warm house.

425
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,126
Hurry and call Darkness over.

426
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,292
Quickly, call her here.

427
00:20:54,293 --> 00:20:55,212
Kazuma.

428
00:20:57,994 --> 00:20:58,662
What is this?

429
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,413
What?

430
00:21:01,411 --> 00:21:04,304
I am sorry I said something…

431
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:05,397
Hey, this is…

432
00:21:06,204 --> 00:21:08,401
I am sorry I said something

433
00:21:08,402 --> 00:21:09,610
like that out of the blue.

434
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,808
Things got really complicated.

435
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:14,198
I realize this is selfish,

436
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:16,604
but I want to leave the squad.

437
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:19,703
Please find someone else to take my place

438
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:20,808
as the vanguard.

439
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,705
I appreciate all of you.

440
00:21:24,204 --> 00:21:25,302
No amount of thanking

441
00:21:25,303 --> 00:21:27,709
will suffice to express my gratitude.

442
00:21:28,406 --> 00:21:31,499
Aqua, Megumin, and Kazuma.

443
00:21:32,411 --> 00:21:34,412
The excursions I have had with you

444
00:21:34,413 --> 00:21:36,901
have been the happiest times

445
00:21:36,902 --> 00:21:38,694
of my life so far.

446
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,604
I shall never forget

447
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:45,787
our adventures together.

448
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:48,412
Thank you for everything over this period.

449
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:52,103
From Lalatina Ford Dustiness.

450
00:21:53,098 --> 00:21:54,595
A heartfelt thank you

451
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:56,408
to my loving companions.

452
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:31,000
(Episode 9: Preaching to the Runaway Girl)

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,396
This is the very end of the line.

454
00:23:34,001 --> 00:23:36,080
Hey, stay tuned.

455
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,098
I don't think you understand.

456
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:40,009
I think this is the store's motto for ads…
