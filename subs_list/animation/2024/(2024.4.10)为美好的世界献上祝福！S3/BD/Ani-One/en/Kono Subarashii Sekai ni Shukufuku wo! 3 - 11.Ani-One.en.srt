1
00:00:01,698 --> 00:00:03,791
Breaking off a noble's wedding

2
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:05,798
is punishable by death.

3
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:08,092
You must be quite foolish

4
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,526
to do something so foolish.

5
00:00:09,528 --> 00:00:11,596
Stop calling me foolish,
you foolish woman.

6
00:00:12,896 --> 00:00:15,804
There is no need for you to take on
the responsibility of paying off my debts!

7
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:17,695
Think you are my wife?

8
00:00:17,696 --> 00:00:20,703
Didn't I tell you to just be honest
if you have feelings for me?

9
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,502
I never said that!

10
00:00:23,503 --> 00:00:26,399
You fool!

11
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:29,901
(Episode 11: Blessings for the Unchanging Daily Life)
Who does this lowly pauper think they are, daring to be so arrogant?

12
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:33,994
Lalatina owes me two billion, you know.

13
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:37,484
If you want her, bring the money,

14
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:40,885
assuming you have it.

15
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:42,995
You know, a true gentleman
always keeps his promises.

16
00:00:43,594 --> 00:00:45,000
Say what?

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,500
Here's the two billion
that Darkness borrowed.

18
00:00:49,192 --> 00:00:52,693
Now I can bring her along.

19
00:01:01,797 --> 00:01:03,999
T-Two billion?

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,593
M-My money.

21
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:09,182
-Hey, that's my money!
-Money, it's money…

22
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:11,495
Hey, you people!

23
00:01:12,105 --> 00:01:12,698
That's my money!

24
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:15,396
This money…
Where did this money come from?

25
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:17,193
I sold them.

26
00:01:18,502 --> 00:01:21,907
I managed to sell off all the knowledge
and rights I could think of,

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,489
along with the bounty
I had saved up from before,

28
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,599
and it ended up totaling
a cool two billion Eris.

29
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:30,188
No way.

30
00:01:30,894 --> 00:01:32,301
You…

31
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:33,900
You really are…

32
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,490
You can't say no.

33
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:41,312
Listen. Starting now, I am going to
have complete control over you.

34
00:01:41,313 --> 00:01:44,274
You will have to repay the money
I spent with your body.

35
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:45,687
Get ready for it.

36
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:48,593
Do you get it, you twisted cross knight!

37
00:01:48,594 --> 00:01:51,193
Answer me if you get it!

38
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:55,995
Yes!

39
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,296
Those words just now

40
00:02:01,297 --> 00:02:04,499
felt like a direct hit to a masochist.

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,594
Why are you holding me back
when it matters?

42
00:02:08,198 --> 00:02:09,489
Don't take my money!

43
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,204
That hurts!

44
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:16,192
To ask me to pay back with my body

45
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:18,333
and even carry me like a princess…

46
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,593
Hey, you're drooling.

47
00:02:20,594 --> 00:02:22,192
Just like always,
Mr. Kazuma is truly despicable.

48
00:02:22,193 --> 00:02:22,792
Despicable?

49
00:02:22,793 --> 00:02:25,598
You are paying back the debt
she took on for you,

50
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,989
but for some reason, you make
it seem like you are purchasing her.

51
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,593
I am asking her to work hard

52
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:31,495
to gain money as an adventurer.

53
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,791
M-Mr. Kazuma.

54
00:02:35,792 --> 00:02:38,188
Get down and walk by yourself!

55
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:41,801
You have got quite the muscles,
so you are quite the heavyweight!

56
00:02:41,802 --> 00:02:43,505
Do not call me a heavyweight!

57
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,198
I've seen it all now.

58
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:52,097
Get out of my path, ye scum of the earth!

59
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,998
If you do not step aside,

60
00:02:53,999 --> 00:02:55,994
I will harm you!

61
00:02:55,995 --> 00:02:59,010
I don't understand why you are
going in there all by yourself!

62
00:02:59,011 --> 00:02:59,902
Aqua, support!

63
00:02:59,903 --> 00:03:01,588
Cast support magic on me!

64
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:03,395
Yeah!

65
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:06,093
Do you need the Master of Talent magic?

66
00:03:06,094 --> 00:03:07,895
It hurts!

67
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,988
It's going to split open,
it's going to split open!

68
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,395
You guys!

69
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:13,093
Forget about her, come over here quickly!

70
00:03:13,094 --> 00:03:15,588
Help me pick up the money.

71
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:18,315
Yes, sir!

72
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:21,411
Very well.

73
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,093
Lord Aldarp.

74
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:25,801
Why are you all here?

75
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:28,693
Hurry up and catch Lalatina!

76
00:03:30,587 --> 00:03:31,490
Very well.

77
00:03:31,491 --> 00:03:32,599
In this rate…

78
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:43,390
I will not allow you to go.

79
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:44,698
So big!

80
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:47,603
Stop there!

81
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:50,301
Holy cow. We are running out of options.

82
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:51,650
What should we do?

83
00:03:51,651 --> 00:03:53,333
Any ideas on what we should do?

84
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:57,402
Light of Saber!

85
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:07,103
Megumin, it worked!

86
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:08,603
I have managed to do it!

87
00:04:08,604 --> 00:04:10,297
If it is a request from a close friend,

88
00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:13,591
I'm willing to do something
that could be considered questionable.

89
00:04:14,193 --> 00:04:15,193
Yeah, yeah.

90
00:04:15,195 --> 00:04:17,302
You truly are my close friend.

91
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,891
The wicked magician has shown up.

92
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,094
I went with my gut

93
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,401
and came to take the bride away.

94
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:32,093
She has been throwing around
Explosion in the town!

95
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,999
That's the crazy…

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,005
There is no way that light
could be Explosion, could there?

97
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:39,900
H-Huh?

98
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:42,899
Megumin, Mr. Kazuma…

99
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,796
She must be faking.

100
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:52,499
Do you know the implications
of casting that kind of spell here?

101
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,452
Hurry up and catch her!

102
00:04:54,453 --> 00:04:57,900
Oh, you think I'd be scared?

103
00:04:57,901 --> 00:05:00,895
Scared of casting Explosion?

104
00:05:00,896 --> 00:05:02,793
Alright, alright.

105
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:05,505
I accept your challenge.

106
00:05:07,088 --> 00:05:08,093
Stop it!

107
00:05:08,094 --> 00:05:09,800
We won't come any closer, so stop it!

108
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:12,682
Lord Aldarp, please do not provoke her!

109
00:05:12,683 --> 00:05:15,001
You took away my moment of glory.

110
00:05:15,593 --> 00:05:18,100
I didn't expect you to beat me to it.

111
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:20,745
Megumin, and Yunyun.

112
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:22,604
I will…

113
00:05:23,794 --> 00:05:25,297
I will thank you once we get back.

114
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:28,598
Um…

115
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:31,396
Aren't we companions?

116
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:37,312
I will not let a fine cross knight
quit our squad that simply.

117
00:05:40,193 --> 00:05:42,698
Hey, you onlookers over there!

118
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,702
You, who appear to be adventurers,

119
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:49,593
bring my bride back for me!

120
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:51,494
I will give you a nice reward.

121
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:53,390
How much do you want?

122
00:05:53,391 --> 00:05:55,307
Did you hear that?

123
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:58,803
You can get rid
of the just-getting-by life.

124
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:09,094
Hey, come play soccer!

125
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:12,093
Very well.

126
00:06:12,094 --> 00:06:13,994
Hey, pass the ball!

127
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:16,287
Pass it here, pass it here!

128
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:22,402
Come on.

129
00:06:23,286 --> 00:06:24,407
Wha--

130
00:06:26,795 --> 00:06:30,197
Everyone wants to help you.

131
00:06:30,198 --> 00:06:33,193
Get over your intransigence,
give it some serious thought.

132
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:40,785
It's wonderful.

133
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:43,900
Lord Aldarp.

134
00:06:43,901 --> 00:06:46,391
Finally arrived.

135
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:47,692
This is bad.

136
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:48,895
Hurry, get out of here!

137
00:06:48,896 --> 00:06:50,495
K-Kazuma.

138
00:06:52,406 --> 00:06:56,297
I can't keep it up any longer.

139
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:59,500
May I cast it now?

140
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,303
May I cast it now?

141
00:07:05,198 --> 00:07:06,583
N-No, you can't.

142
00:07:06,584 --> 00:07:07,885
You can't cast it here.

143
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:08,886
I can't hold out any longer.

144
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,083
No, no, no. You can still hold on, right?

145
00:07:11,084 --> 00:07:12,423
You are capable of accomplishing
anything you set your mind to.

146
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:14,687
Let go slowly, like that.

147
00:07:14,688 --> 00:07:16,999
Good girl, you can't give up, okay?

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,697
I can't do it anymore.

149
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:22,083
-Everyone, quickly get away from me!
-Can't you?

150
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:26,094
Run!

151
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:30,192
Explosion!

152
00:08:01,403 --> 00:08:04,997
Alright. Why not go now?

153
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:08,896
Hey.

154
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:12,595
It is really disappointing
to see someone hiding

155
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:14,896
behind the person
they are supposed to save.

156
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:17,096
-You are awful, Mr. Kazuma.
-I'm Kazuma.

157
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,007
They are going to flee!

158
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,199
She can no longer use Explosion.

159
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,788
Quickly catch them!

160
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,211
Mr. Kazuma, Mr. Kazuma.

161
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:30,888
Aqua?

162
00:08:31,294 --> 00:08:33,793
That hurts!

163
00:08:33,794 --> 00:08:36,491
A sudden force pushed me down!

164
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:39,996
Fracture. I have a fracture.

165
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:42,597
Dust, save me!

166
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:45,892
Hey, Keith.

167
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,694
This is just too awful.

168
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,299
He's got a comminuted fracture in his arm.

169
00:08:51,793 --> 00:08:53,289
Who cares?

170
00:08:54,502 --> 00:08:55,382
Wha--

171
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:57,293
Hey, let go of me.

172
00:08:57,294 --> 00:08:59,283
Did you not say it was a fracture?
How come you can still grab it?

173
00:08:59,284 --> 00:09:01,294
Hey, hey, hey!

174
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,702
You have rendered
my dearest friend immobile,

175
00:09:05,703 --> 00:09:07,804
and you have not even expressed regret?

176
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,689
You are really pulling off
the big shot, right?

177
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:12,793
You mentioned that there was a fracture,

178
00:09:12,794 --> 00:09:14,695
at what point did it become immobile?

179
00:09:15,197 --> 00:09:16,506
Give me a break.

180
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:19,006
That hurts!

181
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,006
He attacked me!

182
00:09:21,007 --> 00:09:24,100
They are taking advantage
of their privileges!

183
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,486
Don't underestimate adventurers!

184
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:36,783
I have been dealing
with some difficult nobles lately,

185
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:40,397
so I might just vent
my frustration on you.

186
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:42,898
Let us treat them to
some bubble wine later.

187
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:45,793
My bride!

188
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:49,502
Don't go, don't go, Lalatina!

189
00:09:52,402 --> 00:09:53,418
You are…

190
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,516
Excuse me.

191
00:10:11,505 --> 00:10:13,505
So beautiful.

192
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:16,730
Just like your mother.

193
00:10:17,603 --> 00:10:19,001
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:20,107 --> 00:10:22,022
I opted to marry on my own

195
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:25,816
and ended up ruining everything.

196
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:28,303
I see.

197
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:34,511
Kazuma.

198
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:38,021
I will walk outside to get some fresh air.

199
00:10:43,103 --> 00:10:46,220
Thank you, I am very grateful to you.

200
00:10:47,206 --> 00:10:50,235
I am only returning a favor
to your daughter.

201
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,604
Take my daughter away from here, Kazuma.

202
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:57,808
Please.

203
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:00,213
I don't want to.

204
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:01,620
What is the deal with this?
Is it some kind of punishment game?

205
00:11:03,313 --> 00:11:06,303
W-Why do you always act like this?

206
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:08,788
What the heck?

207
00:11:09,505 --> 00:11:13,922
Looks like the kingdom's confidant
has figured out what I am thinking.

208
00:11:15,115 --> 00:11:16,708
Understood.

209
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,620
I will take good care of her.

210
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,302
Lalatina.

211
00:11:25,303 --> 00:11:28,313
Are you content with your current life?

212
00:11:29,212 --> 00:11:30,421
Yes.

213
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:32,203
To the extent that I would be
willing to sacrifice everything

214
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:34,511
to protect my companions.

215
00:11:35,714 --> 00:11:37,214
I see.

216
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:52,715
Father, I love you.

217
00:11:53,616 --> 00:11:57,620
Many thanks for seeing me
through childhood and into maturity.

218
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,828
Once you feel better,

219
00:12:01,516 --> 00:12:05,224
go ahead and share stories
about mom with me

220
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:08,710
until I drift off to sleep.

221
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:14,621
It appears that you have
regressed to a younger age.

222
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:20,459
Just for a little while…
remain… in this state…

223
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:22,412
Father.

224
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,215
He does not have much time left.

225
00:12:28,104 --> 00:12:31,370
Sacred Break Spell.

226
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:39,209
Father!

227
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,119
This is a curse.

228
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,000
You have been hit
with quite a powerful curse.

229
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:47,704
I effortlessly lifted it with my strength.

230
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,312
That'll be fine.

231
00:12:58,313 --> 00:13:00,213
Darkness, that's really great.

232
00:13:00,214 --> 00:13:03,704
Mister, do not forget to tell her
more about her mom.

233
00:13:06,412 --> 00:13:08,699
How beautiful.

234
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:12,214
Useless demon!

235
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,401
So, is that all there is to your power

236
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:17,105
of manipulating reality?

237
00:13:20,011 --> 00:13:23,515
It appears that the curse
I cast upon Lord Dustiness

238
00:13:23,516 --> 00:13:25,604
has been lifted.

239
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:26,819
The curse has been lifted?

240
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:29,099
That's not good.

241
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,709
If it goes on like this…

242
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,614
Max!

243
00:13:32,615 --> 00:13:34,416
Help me come up with a clever excuse

244
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:37,015
to bend reality this time.

245
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,114
No can do, Aldarp.

246
00:13:39,115 --> 00:13:40,802
No can do?

247
00:13:40,803 --> 00:13:42,911
You useless demon.

248
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:44,922
Do you not remember that
I was the one who summoned you

249
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,307
with this sacred treasure?

250
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:47,308
Do it!

251
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:49,520
You have no right to refuse.

252
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:50,797
Can't be helped.

253
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:54,312
The powerful light that breaks
the curse is obstructing me.

254
00:13:54,313 --> 00:13:55,911
So I can't do it.

255
00:13:55,912 --> 00:13:58,109
You useless thing.

256
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,812
I don't need a guy like you.

257
00:14:00,813 --> 00:14:02,614
Here's the last command.

258
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:05,593
Bring Lalatina to me.

259
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,011
If you do so, I will pay the price.

260
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:10,214
Pay the price?

261
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:12,411
Yes.

262
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:13,817
If you bring Lalatina to me--

263
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,303
My lord.

264
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,209
I have come to apologize to you
for today's incident.

265
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:20,994
W-Well done, Max.

266
00:14:20,995 --> 00:14:23,604
I will pay you the price as agreed.

267
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:25,516
And then cancel the contract.

268
00:14:25,518 --> 00:14:29,006
-Contract…
-Lalatina, Lalatina.

269
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:35,314
My lord.

270
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:37,948
I am willing to offer
my own body in exchange

271
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:38,808
for the life of my companions.

272
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,625
You are mine…

273
00:14:40,626 --> 00:14:44,709
You are already mine.

274
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:51,505
So, did you think the person
who showed up was Lalatina?

275
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:53,933
Unfortunately, it's me.

276
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,210
Oh.

277
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:59,114
Such stunning
and powerful negative emotions.

278
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,011
Truly delicious, truly delicious.

279
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,110
This eerie sensation…

280
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,818
Just like Max.

281
00:15:06,517 --> 00:15:08,401
Have I seen you somewhere?

282
00:15:09,014 --> 00:15:12,468
I have lost count of how many times
I have introduced myself to you.

283
00:15:12,469 --> 00:15:15,401
It is nice to meet you again.

284
00:15:15,402 --> 00:15:18,505
Maxwell, a master of bending reality.

285
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:22,318
I am Vanir, the demon
with the ability to see into the future.

286
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,205
Vanir?

287
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:25,614
Vanir.

288
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:28,709
What is happening?
I am feeling a wave of nostalgia.

289
00:15:29,411 --> 00:15:31,109
Let's go back to hell.

290
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,205
Maxwell, the master of bending reality.

291
00:15:33,206 --> 00:15:35,417
That guy is my servant.

292
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:37,713
Servant?

293
00:15:37,714 --> 00:15:41,614
Maxwell, a Duke of Hell much like me,

294
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:43,412
is your servant?

295
00:15:44,006 --> 00:15:46,135
D-Duke?

296
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:48,511
You are fortunate.

297
00:15:49,306 --> 00:15:51,302
If you had summoned another demon,

298
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:53,807
you would have definitely
been ripped apart on the spot.

299
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:55,719
Vanir, Vanir.

300
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:59,814
You are where you are because of him.

301
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:02,214
Do not forget to express
your gratitude to him.

302
00:16:04,013 --> 00:16:06,901
Pay the price as agreed.

303
00:16:06,902 --> 00:16:08,907
Then, terminate the contract.

304
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:12,015
Exactly.

305
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:16,177
The real issue lies in the contract
between you and Maxwell.

306
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:19,302
Gosh.

307
00:16:19,303 --> 00:16:22,203
It was quite a hassle
for no reason at all.

308
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:23,406
Could it be…

309
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,713
You have got the right idea.

310
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:29,724
I am the one who discovered how to
make that brat repay his debt

311
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:32,808
and informed him about you.

312
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,520
Very well.

313
00:16:35,521 --> 00:16:37,297
Such amazing negative emotions.

314
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:40,012
Truly delicious, truly delicious.

315
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:43,907
What? What did you say? Bastard!

316
00:16:47,912 --> 00:16:50,709
Okay, you are no longer needed.

317
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:53,208
I will bring him back to hell,

318
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:57,415
then return to toiling away
under that useless manager.

319
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:01,516
Vanir, Vanir.

320
00:17:01,518 --> 00:17:05,522
We must make sure Aldarp
pays the price before we leave.

321
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:07,609
Yeah, yeah.

322
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,516
I'll pay you the price, now please leave.

323
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:16,109
It hurts! It hurts!

324
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:19,103
Aldarp, Aldarp.

325
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,521
-What a wonderful scream, Aldarp.
-Let me go, Maxwell!

326
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:22,203
-What a wonderful scream, Aldarp.
-Stop it, just stop!

327
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:23,703
The price you must pay is to give him

328
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:27,011
the negative emotions that he most enjoys.

329
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,016
The remaining years of your life
are completely insufficient.

330
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:33,902
In…

331
00:17:33,903 --> 00:17:36,620
In that case, sacrifice someone
from your family?

332
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:37,911
Unfortunately,

333
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:40,907
we can only demand the price from
the individual who signed the contract.

334
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:46,619
Although it is a really
precious negative emotion,

335
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,912
despair is not my preference.

336
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,806
That negative emotion is…

337
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:55,110
Maxwell's favorite.

338
00:17:58,318 --> 00:17:59,912
The lord has disappeared?

339
00:18:00,613 --> 00:18:03,120
For some reason, all the horrible things
he did were revealed, and the one who

340
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,817
delivered the sacred treasure
that can exchange bodies to Princess Iris

341
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:08,016
appears to have been him as well.

342
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:11,020
I heard he went away
since his wrongdoings were revealed.

343
00:18:11,021 --> 00:18:12,317
It is the talk of the town.

344
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:13,516
Seriously?

345
00:18:14,909 --> 00:18:16,724
You no longer have to run away at night.

346
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,505
See, I said nothing would happen.

347
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:23,010
Really.

348
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:26,105
I stayed up all night to prepare the bag.
I'm exhausted.

349
00:18:26,597 --> 00:18:28,547
In any case, we will sleep
until the evening

350
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:30,717
and then go to the guild for dinner.

351
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:32,895
What's wrong with you?

352
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:34,317
Darkness?

353
00:18:34,318 --> 00:18:36,802
Megumin, you don't know yet, do you?

354
00:18:36,803 --> 00:18:40,609
Kazuma bought Darkness.

355
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:43,005
Is she too terrified to enter the house?

356
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:45,323
Hey, watch your language.

357
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:46,398
No, Megumin.

358
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:49,010
Not quite, while that is not inaccurate,
it is not like that.

359
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,615
I am sorry, I did something selfish.

360
00:18:53,713 --> 00:18:55,808
I actually done something stupid.

361
00:18:59,615 --> 00:19:01,413
I don't mind at all.

362
00:19:01,414 --> 00:19:03,895
Although Kazuma lost
a lot of stuff all at once,

363
00:19:03,896 --> 00:19:05,609
the end result is excellent.

364
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,916
Yeah, yeah.

365
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:07,516
Because of this,

366
00:19:07,517 --> 00:19:10,115
I discovered
that your father has been cursed.

367
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,109
That money should be

368
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,016
reimbursed with the lord's
confiscated possessions.

369
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:19,714
However…

370
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,901
The intellectual property that Kazuma sold

371
00:19:25,005 --> 00:19:26,407
will never be reclaimed.

372
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,312
So that was the reason?

373
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:30,495
Don't worry about it.

374
00:19:31,308 --> 00:19:32,677
After all, I've already
learned cooking skills.

375
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:33,613
I can set up a stall…

376
00:19:34,405 --> 00:19:36,406
Huh? Will I get my money back?

377
00:19:36,803 --> 00:19:37,714
Yes.

378
00:19:37,715 --> 00:19:39,906
The two billion you advanced for me,

379
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,496
along with additional compensations.

380
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:44,823
T-Two billion?

381
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:49,208
I always feel that Mr. Kazuma is a bit…

382
00:19:49,209 --> 00:19:51,708
Yes, very much that.

383
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:52,521
Huh?

384
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:55,609
I want to make a nice tiny
hut for Jelteman.

385
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,411
That's right, it's exactly that feeling.

386
00:19:58,412 --> 00:20:01,026
By the way, I want a new robe.

387
00:20:01,027 --> 00:20:03,010
These annoying women…

388
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:06,917
Listen up,
I'm going to stay out for a week.

389
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:10,906
What's wrong? Didn't I say I don't mind?

390
00:20:12,406 --> 00:20:16,823
Um… the letter I wrote…

391
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:18,917
I see.

392
00:20:19,607 --> 00:20:21,824
Does she think she is
no longer a member of our team?

393
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:24,955
What, that's--

394
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:27,120
What are you talking about?

395
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,698
You are a vital cross knight on our team.

396
00:20:30,699 --> 00:20:32,614
I will surely not let you go.

397
00:20:32,615 --> 00:20:33,807
That's right.

398
00:20:33,808 --> 00:20:35,614
What's the point of talking about it now?

399
00:20:35,615 --> 00:20:37,505
Are you an idiot?

400
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:40,505
Is not this the only place you belong?

401
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:43,609
Hey, that's what I wanted to say.

402
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,011
Um…

403
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:51,609
I am a cross knight
who is physically strong

404
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,308
but can't fence well.

405
00:20:56,701 --> 00:20:59,511
But is it possible

406
00:21:02,806 --> 00:21:06,714
for me to join you again?

407
00:21:10,616 --> 00:21:12,011
Of course, you can.

408
00:21:15,203 --> 00:21:16,203
Welcome back.

409
00:21:21,902 --> 00:21:22,902
I…

410
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:25,714
I'm back.

411
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:35,116
I remember being joyful
every day from the time

412
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:38,116
I lived with the princess

413
00:21:38,117 --> 00:21:40,204
until I experienced
the team's survival dilemma

414
00:21:40,205 --> 00:21:42,403
and the raucous moments.

415
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:44,820
With friends on my side

416
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,121
and reliable individuals all around.

417
00:21:50,315 --> 00:21:52,107
I dwell in this town,

418
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:55,837
and perhaps I will journey
with these teammates again

419
00:21:55,838 --> 00:21:58,502
to seek modest pleasures.

420
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:03,013
In this wonderful world.

421
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,807
Attempted?

422
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:07,685
Hey, Kazuma.

423
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:09,518
You're not actually an idiot, are you?

424
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,424
Weren't you going to bring Darkness back?

425
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:14,982
Even though it was a night raid,

426
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:15,721
I was merely touched in the stomach.

427
00:22:15,723 --> 00:22:17,319
Night raid?

428
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,366
Wait a second.

429
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:19,294
No, that's true.

430
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:21,006
Although that is true,

431
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:22,913
did not you hold my hand yourself?

432
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:24,715
Hold hand?

433
00:22:24,716 --> 00:22:25,814
No, that's not it.

434
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:28,023
I was thinking
since I have to marry the lord anyway…

435
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:30,204
Admitted!

436
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:33,002
Darkness admitted she had seduced him!

437
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,824
I will not disturb you people,

438
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:38,402
I am going to sun the Jelteman.

439
00:22:38,403 --> 00:22:41,717
How shameless can you be, Darkness?

440
00:22:41,718 --> 00:22:43,574
And here I was, worrying about you!

441
00:22:43,575 --> 00:22:46,513
Wait. H-Hold on.

442
00:22:46,514 --> 00:22:47,445
Hey, Kazuma.

443
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,216
Explain it properly.

444
00:22:49,804 --> 00:22:51,029
It can't be helped.

445
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:53,110
Hey, Aqua.

446
00:22:53,111 --> 00:22:55,314
How does this country register marriages?

447
00:22:55,815 --> 00:22:57,304
Why are you asking this so suddenly?

448
00:22:58,014 --> 00:22:59,803
To begin, on the morning of the wedding
ceremony, file a marriage application

449
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:03,308
with government offices
to become a married pair.

450
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:07,127
Then, at noon, hold the wedding ceremony…

451
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:09,620
What caused you to suddenly freeze?

452
00:23:10,117 --> 00:23:14,315
It is becoming more common for people
to go through a divorce these days.

453
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,819
It is clear she is a masochist
and a virgin,

454
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,815
but she is being divorced…

455
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,819
The man fled in stealth overnight.

456
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,815
Does this indicate that people
will believe Darkness has been abandoned?

457
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:30,508
Alright.

458
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:32,111
Do not stress about trivial stuff
like marriage registration.

459
00:23:33,717 --> 00:23:34,908
Divorcedness.

460
00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:36,506
Wha--

461
00:23:36,507 --> 00:23:43,908
Don't call me Divorcedness!
