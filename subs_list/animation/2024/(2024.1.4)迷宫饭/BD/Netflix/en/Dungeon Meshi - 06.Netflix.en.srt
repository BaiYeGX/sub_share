1
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,557
It's locked again.

3
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,892
Give me a minute.

4
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,268
I'll open it in no time.

5
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,148
{\an8}We walked quite a bit already,

6
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,151
{\an8}so maybe we can call it a day soon.

7
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,449
You sure are clever, Marcille,
answering with your stomach.

8
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,910
It wasn't me!

9
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,662
It's completely normal.

10
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,790
After all, we've only had snacks today.

11
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:07,335
But Laios, I'm against taking a break.

12
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,757
The only foodstuff we found today
was a bowl full of Treasure Bugs.

13
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,594
{\an8}Even if we have to push ourselves,
we should make for the fourth floor.

14
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:22,308
Still, the monsters will get tougher
and tougher the further we go.

15
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,769
I think we should conserve our energy.

16
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,647
But even if we save our energy,

17
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,566
it won't matter
if we pass out from hunger.

18
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,570
But without energy,
we wouldn't be able to defeat monsters…

19
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,656
It's open.

20
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,793
This room looks like
it used to be a dining hall.

21
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,796
This must've been a luxurious dining table
once upon a time.

22
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,055
But now, it's just the dead
haunting this place.

23
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,016
There's not even a single rat in here.

24
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,684
I'm not eating a rat, okay?

25
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,689
I wonder why it's always
dead humans who attack us.

26
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,775
Can't a whole roasted pig
come after us for a change?

27
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,193
Don't be silly.

28
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,738
{\an8}"Come after us"…

29
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,949
But we do have…

30
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,995
food coming after us!

31
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,833
Living Painting?

32
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:29,959
Watch it, Laios!

33
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,088
You got too close!

34
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,340
You could've gotten sucked in!

35
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:38,301
{\an8}That's what I wanted!
I was just getting to the good part!

36
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,219
{\an8}What?

37
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,222
There were grapes in that painting.

38
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,890
In other words,

39
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,893
you were trying
to eat the food in the painting.

40
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,520
That's right.
Pretty neat idea, don't you think?

41
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,231
-Absolutely not!
-You moron!

42
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,651
-Moron! What were you thinking?
-Ever heard the saying, "pie in the sky"?

43
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,404
I-I know you can't
actually eat a pie in the sky.

44
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,075
But a painting of someone
eating a pie in the sky works!

45
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,411
You'll end up getting killed
inside the painting.

46
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,038
{\an8}Precisely!

47
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:10,667
{\an8}Inside the painting, we should be able
to interact with each other!

48
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,340
Fine. Have it your way, then.

49
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:19,050
But you can only give it a try once.

50
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,136
We'll tie a rope around you.

51
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,640
If you give us a signal,
we'll pull you out.

52
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,601
Which painting should I go for?

53
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,562
This one looks pretty good.

54
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,731
There's a lot of delicious food in it.

55
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,442
All right, I'll go for this painting.

56
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,204
Ow.

57
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,289
Hey, you.

58
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,791
<i>I've already been spotted!</i>

59
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,584
That sword…

60
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,296
You're wearing odd armor,

61
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:58,423
but you're one of the castle guards,
aren't you?

62
00:04:58,506 --> 00:04:59,340
Huh?

63
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,176
Here, carry this.

64
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,097
Seriously, we're always
running short on hands.

65
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,766
This way! Don't space out!

66
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,607
Look at his face. He looks so clever!

67
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,611
Yes, the shape of his nose
is just like yours.

68
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,615
He will lead the kingdom
splendidly one day.

69
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,120
-There, there. You're a good boy.
-Congratulations, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,289
Stop daydreaming!

71
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,124
Bring the next plate already!

72
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,627
-Um, could I have a bite--
-I have it!

73
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,214
{\an8}Delgal! Your name is Delgal!

74
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,261
Delgal, you'll become a great king!

75
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,345
This is no good!

76
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,473
There's no chance of me eating anything!

77
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,185
Help me out!

78
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,437
It's his signal!

79
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,772
Pull!

80
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,735
How was it?

81
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,948
I was so close to getting a bite.

82
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,202
{\an8}But the vibe just wasn't right.

83
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,621
{\an8}-The vibe?
-That's what stopped you?

84
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,832
{\an8}Yeah, it was totally the vibe.

85
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,417
One more time!

86
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,045
I can grab a bite
if the situation is more suitable.

87
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,339
What do you mean by "suitable"?

88
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,590
Let's see.

89
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:26,552
I guess it needs to be more casual.

90
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,890
Casual?

91
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,102
How about this one?

92
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,729
They have fancy food,
it looks like a party,

93
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,397
and there's even someone dancing naked.

94
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,857
This is it! Here I go!

95
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,952
You drunk fool!

96
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,871
What do you think you're doing
in front of the king?

97
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,707
Get down from the table now!

98
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,834
Oh, stop it.

99
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,837
{\an8}Today is my wedding day.

100
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,590
Pardon this man for getting
a little too carried away.

101
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,801
But Prince Delgal…

102
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,511
<i>Delgal?</i>

103
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,847
<i>Is he the baby in the painting earlier?</i>

104
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,265
Come on, go!

105
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,852
<i>That was a close call!</i>

106
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,603
Delgal!

107
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,355
Father!

108
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,192
I am glad to see
how splendidly you have grown.

109
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,487
To the future of this kingdom.

110
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,337
F-Father!

111
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,549
He was poisoned!

112
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,887
<i>Guess I'll take some back with me
and enjoy them quietly later.</i>

113
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,268
Sorry.

114
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,519
Your Majesty!

115
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,438
Treat him now!

116
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:01,397
Hurry!

117
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,567
<i>That elf, I spotted him
in the previous painting as well.</i>

118
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,402
<i>I wonder if he's a jester or something.</i>

119
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,658
Look what I've got!

120
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,410
I brought back food this time…

121
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,038
Wait, what? It's all gone!

122
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,667
{\an8}So I can't take food out of the painting.

123
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,420
{\an8}The only way is to eat them
inside the painting!

124
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,257
Again! Now that it's come to this,
I must have a taste of the food!

125
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,558
FULL-COURSE OF COURT CUISINE

126
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,397
<i>Is this a crowning ceremony?</i>

127
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,400
<i>So that prince succeeded to the throne.</i>

128
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:54,200
May this kingdom and its people
flourish for eternity.

129
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,335
<i>It's good!</i>

130
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,299
<i>It's good!</i>

131
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,760
<i>I thought it might taste like paint,</i>

132
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,221
<i>but this is a real feast!</i>

133
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,693
Seconds, please.

134
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,699
<i>I sure ate a ton.</i>

135
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,742
I'm stuffed.

136
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,663
Guess I'll go back now.

137
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,961
<i>Huh? This is…</i>

138
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,591
-You don't belong to this castle.
-<i>Damn!</i>

139
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,676
What are you doing?

140
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,304
You were there when the prince was born
and also at his wedding.

141
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,599
What is your purpose?

142
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,225
Are you after the throne?

143
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,105
I'll reduce you to ashes right now!

144
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,693
The painting!

145
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,907
Did something happen inside the painting?

146
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,703
There were tons of mouthwatering dishes.

147
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,414
As I was about to leave
after eating my fill,

148
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,376
someone realized I was an outsider,
grabbed me by the collar,

149
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,171
{\an8}and got really mad.

150
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,839
{\an8}I'm not surprised.

151
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,425
{\an8}I was so scared.

152
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,764
Now that I'm relaxed,
I'm starting to feel hungry again.

153
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,977
{\an8}Wait, what? Even though I ate a lot,
my stomach still feels empty!

154
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,188
What did we tell you?

155
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,523
It was just a pie in the sky!

156
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,233
You wasted our time!

157
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,070
But it really tasted good!

158
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,036
Was this the kitchen?

159
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,498
We can collect water
from the room next door,

160
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,708
and it's a nice spot to rest for a bit.

161
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,711
If you hadn't fooled around
with the paintings,

162
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,214
we probably could've reached
the fourth floor by now.

163
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,847
<i>Is that a Mimic?</i>

164
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,851
<i>I've never noticed that box there before.</i>

165
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,729
<i>It's not super obvious,
but it's not exactly hidden, either.</i>

166
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,856
<i>It's positioned in a way
that catches your eye.</i>

167
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,777
{\an8}<i>It's in a spot those bastards are fond of.</i>

168
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,073
{\an8}So, let's get some shut-eye here today.

169
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,032
{\an8}Okay.

170
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,410
{\an8}You good with that, Chilchuck?

171
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,869
{\an8}Sure.

172
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,458
<i>I suppose I don't have to tell them.</i>

173
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,920
<i>I just know Senshi and Laios
will insist on eating it.</i>

174
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:55,881
<i>Then, it'll be up to me to open the box.</i>

175
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,051
{\an8}<i>Mimics…</i>

176
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,680
{\an8}<i>I've lost count of the times
those bastards have caused me misery!</i>

177
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:04,890
All right!

178
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,851
It doesn't have a lock or a trap!

179
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,692
Since this was locked, it's not a Mimic!

180
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,327
If I open it from behind,
it shouldn't be able to hurt me!

181
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,833
Dammit! I forgot about the trap!

182
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,339
<i>Damn Mimics!</i>

183
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,508
You okay?

184
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,011
You seemed lost in thought.

185
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,971
Is something bothering you?

186
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,015
No, not really.

187
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,892
You must be tired.

188
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,268
You're still a child, after all.

189
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,812
Let him have a good night's sleep
without having to stand guard.

190
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,273
Like I said, I'm not a kid!

191
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,275
So, how old are you?

192
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,526
I'd rather not say.

193
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,821
There you go again.
You're always like that.

194
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,532
You won't even tell us
your hometown or your birthday.

195
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,827
I prefer to keep my job
and personal life in separate lanes.

196
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:10,206
{\an8}One of these days, you'll miss out
if you keep acting that way.

197
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,957
{\an8}Sure, whatever.

198
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,841
<i>I've become more sensitive to hunger.</i>

199
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,052
<i>I used to be fine
without food for two days.</i>

200
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,640
<i>I'll go and fetch some water
from the next room.</i>

201
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,059
Hey, slowpoke.

202
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,063
I'm going to draw some water.

203
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,900
I'll go with you.

204
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,527
Don't bother. I'll be right back.

205
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,820
It's dangerous.

206
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,030
It's just the next room.

207
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,127
<i>A Coin Bug.</i>

208
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,129
<i>I wonder if there's a nest nearby.</i>

209
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,841
<i>If I can find a few more,
it might help ease our hunger.</i>

210
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,929
<i>Not to sound like Laios,
but I kinda like Coin Bugs.</i>

211
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,224
<i>They're monsters
that camouflage like Mimics,</i>

212
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,225
<i>but they're cute.</i>

213
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,476
Hey!

214
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,812
Wait a minute, that's where the Mimic--

215
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,275
<i>You idiot.</i>

216
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:22,486
<i>You forgot you're heavier
with the water bag.</i>

217
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,322
<i>There should be a mechanism nearby
to open this door.</i>

218
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,993
<i>Of course, it's out of reach.</i>

219
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,203
{\an8}<i>Should I call for help?</i>

220
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:35,708
{\an8}<i>If my yelling attracts more monsters,
it will put my friends in danger.</i>

221
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,667
{\an8}<i>Don't worry.</i>

222
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,086
{\an8}<i>If I don't return, Marcille will notice.</i>

223
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,797
<i>Will she? No, she probably won't.</i>

224
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,923
<i>I can't count on her!</i>

225
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,217
<i>Don't panic!</i>

226
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,344
<i>Opening closed doors</i>

227
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,513
<i>is your job, isn't it?</i>

228
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,350
<i>This type of door opens
once you figure out its mechanism.</i>

229
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,395
<i>I'll be safe
as long as I don't touch the Mimic.</i>

230
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,981
<i>I don't hear
any strange device making noise,</i>

231
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,357
<i>so there's no time limit, either.</i>

232
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,860
<i>There are a couple of buttons on the wall</i>

233
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:06,238
<i>and a mechanism
that likely triggers spears to pop up.</i>

234
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,866
<i>If I press the buttons in the wrong order,
they probably spring up.</i>

235
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,454
<i>And the text on this plate
is likely the key, but…</i>

236
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,999
<i>It's in some ancient language,
and I can't make heads or tails of it.</i>

237
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,543
<i>Darn it, if only Marcille were around.</i>

238
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:24,089
<i>But it seems strangely familiar…</i>

239
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,051
<i>Nah, I should get my
thoughts in order first.</i>

240
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,095
<i>There are three buttons
in the corners of the room.</i>

241
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,347
<i>Why three?</i>

242
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,682
<i>Do I need to press them
in a specific sequence?</i>

243
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,396
<i>There's a button behind the Mimic as well!</i>

244
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,608
<i>Darn it! That bastard
is set on hindering me at every turn!</i>

245
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,652
<i>Could there be a hint inside the room?</i>

246
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:47,321
<i>Of course not.</i>

247
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,699
<i>Even if I press the buttons randomly,
I'll only end up getting skewered.</i>

248
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,369
<i>But since I'm small,
maybe I could dodge them.</i>

249
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,537
<i>Nah, it's too risky.</i>

250
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,583
<i>Ugh, I have no idea what to do!</i>

251
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:07,383
{\an8}<i>Maybe I should just
stay still until dawn…</i>

252
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,845
You were in here?!

253
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,015
Darn--

254
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,481
Ow.

255
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,608
I-I was saved--

256
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,993
You sure are tough!

257
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,830
<i>Mimics are cute when you turn them over,
and they wiggle their legs.</i>

258
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,500
<i>You can tell their sex
by turning them over.</i>

259
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,504
<i>Laios' useless trivia
is coming back to me one after another!</i>

260
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,298
Turn them over?

261
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,134
As if that's possible!

262
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,637
<i>Here goes nothing!</i>

263
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:06,942
Ow.

264
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,653
I wonder if they're on their way
to help me after all that commotion.

265
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:11,780
Huh?

266
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,407
So this one was empty?

267
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,783
How dare you mock me like that!

268
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,326
Huh?

269
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,619
This text…

270
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,165
So this is what was written on the plate!

271
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,876
In that case, I know what it says!

272
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,419
Hurry!

273
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,421
-East!
-<i>No matter how many times the sun rises…</i>

274
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,922
-West!
-<i>And the moon sinks…</i>

275
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,799
-North!
-<i>Like the unmoving stars…</i>

276
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,343
South!

277
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:38,223
<i>May the wind of fortune
forever blow your way!</i>

278
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,435
It opened!

279
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,702
Chilchuck isn't coming back!

280
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,793
C-Chilchuck!

281
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,420
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry!

282
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,130
I'm alive, okay?

283
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,174
What's this?

284
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,384
Did you do this, Chilchuck?

285
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,677
Well done!

286
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,054
Sure.

287
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,515
What a fine Mimic.

288
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,809
A Mimic, huh?

289
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,560
It's going to be my first time cooking it.

290
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,355
Don't try to eat it
as if it's the normal thing to do!

291
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,816
Don't worry, Marcille.

292
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,859
Mimics on their own aren't poisonous.

293
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,113
They can be toxic depending on their diet,

294
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,033
but if you remove their digestive organs,
it should be safe.

295
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,578
How is that supposed to be safe?

296
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,081
Forget it, Marcille.

297
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,750
There's no point in telling them not to.

298
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:50,671
{\an8}But today, I won't eat it, no matter what!

299
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,010
Boil plenty of water,

300
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,471
add some salt.

301
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,142
Place the Mimic inside,
cover it with a lid,

302
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,018
and wait a while.

303
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,081
When it's boiled enough,

304
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,292
{\an8}it's done!

305
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,919
{\an8}BOILED MIMIC

306
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,342
It's hard to scoop out the meat.

307
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,178
How about using the handle instead?

308
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,850
It's no good.
I'm only pushing it deeper inside.

309
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:45,893
Right.

310
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,854
Chilchuck, let me use those things.

311
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,813
Those things?

312
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:53,650
{\an8}You know, the picking tools
you're always carrying around.

313
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,111
{\an8}<i>Picking tools.</i>

314
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,325
A-Are you out of your mind?

315
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,369
{\an8}It should be fine
if we disinfect them in boiling water.

316
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,708
That's not the problem!

317
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,460
D-Don't!

318
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,467
It's easy to scoop now!

319
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,678
Here.

320
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,734
It's really good.

321
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,073
This is really tasty.

322
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:44,910
I bet it would be delicious to eat
the back meat and leg meat together.

323
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,205
It wasn't as good as I thought.

324
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,583
They say the digestive gland
of hermit crabs tastes bad.

325
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,838
But why didn't you tell us
about the Mimic?

326
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,133
{\an8}I have unpleasant memories
associated with Mimics.

327
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:03,345
{\an8}Ideally, I'd like to steer clear
of them entirely.

328
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,473
Anyway, I've made
quite a few errors in judgment.

329
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,979
I panicked thinking
it might eat the Treasure Bug.

330
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,564
Mimics don't eat Treasure Bugs.

331
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,482
What?

332
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,527
<i>On the contrary,
Treasure Bugs feed on Mimics.</i>

333
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,945
<i>When they find a Mimic,</i>

334
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,197
<i>they enter the box through the crack
and lay their eggs.</i>

335
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:26,368
<i>And the larvae that hatch inside the box
grow as they consume the Mimic.</i>

336
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,328
<i>Once they become adult insects,</i>

337
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,747
<i>they're often confused
for treasure by humans,</i>

338
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,083
<i>and they take flight
to begin their next phase of life.</i>

339
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,544
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

340
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,754
{\an8}Cut it out, will you?

341
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:40,590
{\an8}That's what you get
for not telling me your age.

342
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,886
{\an8}Didn't you learn that you can miss out
when you keep secrets from your friends?

343
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,764
{\an8}Come on, tell me how old you are!

344
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,809
Th…

345
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,977
"Th…"?

346
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:55,981
This year, I turn 29.

347
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:01,903
So you really are a kid. How boring!

00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,406
I didn't know you were so young.

349
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,658
Well, why don't you
tell me your ages, then!

350
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,119
This is what I hate
about long-lived races!

351
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,456
What?

352
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:15,125
Um, Mister… Chilchuck…

353
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,376
Stop it!

354
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,463
<i>Today, you feast on a monster,</i>

355
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,758
<i>but tomorrow,
you could end up as someone's meal.</i>

356
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,968
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

357
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,554
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>
