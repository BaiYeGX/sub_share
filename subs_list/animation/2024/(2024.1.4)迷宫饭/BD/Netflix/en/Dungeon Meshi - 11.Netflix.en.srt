1
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:09,884
<i>I'm ready now.</i>

2
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:12,887
<i>I can bring down this building anytime.</i>

3
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,642
<i>I still have a lot of magic left.</i>

4
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:21,271
<i>At this rate, I can step in for Laios
and the others if anything happens.</i>

5
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:25,066
<i>This plan is good, right?</i>

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,737
<i>I use up all my magic to stun the dragon.</i>

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,906
<i>Instead of using chancy explosive spells
against the dragon</i>

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,867
<i>at the risk of everyone's lives,</i>

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,745
<i>it's more reliable to bury the dragon
in the debris of a building.</i>

10
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,664
<i>Yes, this is definitely a better plan.</i>

11
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,208
<i>Stay calm.</i>

12
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:48,423
<i>I need to focus on my task.</i>

13
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,509
<i>We'll make this work!</i>

14
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,304
<i>Hang in there, Falin!</i>

15
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,892
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

16
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,006
It noticed us.

17
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,132
Run!

18
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,263
It's so fast!

19
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:03,558
Just so you know, a Red Dragon's
maximum speed is 60 kilometers per hour!

20
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,893
You should've said that earlier!

21
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,228
The terrain is slowing it down!
It's all good!

22
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,564
Turn right at the next corner!

23
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,865
We'll lure it to unleash its fire breath
on this straight path.

24
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,284
<i>Dragons breathe fire</i>

25
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,037
<i>by clicking their tongues
to ignite the fuel stored in their bodies.</i>

26
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,289
<i>To prevent it from lashing out
when we restrain it,</i>

27
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,042
<i>we'll make it use up
all its fuel along the way!</i>

28
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,295
It's clicking its tongue!

29
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,255
Here comes!

30
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,886
<i>What intense heat!</i>

31
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,054
<i>But…</i>

32
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,562
<i>Thanks to this pot and magic,
we can endure it.</i>

33
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,981
<i>Good. So far, so…</i>

34
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,235
{\an8}<i>What?</i>

35
00:03:56,277 --> 00:04:00,281
<i>The heat of the pot
is spreading evenly and…</i>

36
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,283
So hot!

37
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,087
But of course, it's hot!

38
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,006
{\an8}Senshi uses it for cooking every day!

39
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,842
Somehow, I thought it would have
a special resistance to dragon fire.

40
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,052
I thought Namari said

41
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,847
that adamant protects
against all dragon attacks.

42
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,183
{\an8}She was just talking out of her hat!

43
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,476
I never said that.

44
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,939
Ugh, it's doing it again!

45
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,023
We have no choice!

46
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,400
We'll change our route!

47
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,366
Huh?

48
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:44,951
No way!

49
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,452
They're here already?

50
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,954
Aren't they a bit early?

51
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,456
Wait, what?

52
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,084
I thought the plan was to split in two!

53
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,837
Can I go ahead and stick to the plan?

54
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,797
{\an8}Ugh, I don't understand!

55
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,966
Fine! Here goes!

56
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,393
No way!

57
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,770
It's not hurt at all!

58
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,189
Shh!

59
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,107
Don't move.

60
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,036
<i>Its inverse scale is right there.</i>

61
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,331
<i>A few more steps, and I could reach it!</i>

62
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,383
<i>It…</i>

63
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,428
<i>It ran away!</i>

64
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,846
<i>Damn it, Kensuke!</i>

65
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,098
<i>Never trust a monster…</i>

66
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,476
-You…
-Laios! Chilchuck! Get up!

67
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,394
Above us!

68
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,814
Hide under its belly!

69
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,190
Laios, you bastard!

70
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,067
My bad! I'm sorry!

71
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,026
Dammit!

72
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,487
The common language
doesn't have enough words of insult!

73
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,947
<i>Ponza! Toroldo!</i>

74
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,575
-<i>Unerma! Poojam! Varo! Monsanto! Belcher!</i>
-I'm being insulted in a strange language!

75
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,452
What are we gonna do now?

76
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,580
It's angry! It's super angry!

77
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,748
{\an8}We have no choice.

78
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,583
{\an8}Let's run from the side of its tail--

79
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,755
{\an8}No, it's too dangerous.

80
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,425
{\an8}What if we never manage to escape
from under its crotch?

81
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,012
This won't do!

82
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,098
A simple incantation
won't have any effect on it.

83
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,182
Focus!

84
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,360
What did you do that for?!

85
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,987
Our only weapon just got shattered!

86
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,489
What do we do now?!

87
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,324
We have no choice.

88
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,534
Use this.

89
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:32,952
{\an8}What?

90
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,247
{\an8}Is that really made of a special metal?

91
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,292
<i>It slices through the bone
and skin of every monster.</i>

92
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,211
<i>And I've diligently
taken care of it each day.</i>

93
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,255
<i>There's probably
no other like it on this earth.</i>

94
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,757
It's a mithril cooking knife!

95
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,593
Mithril?

96
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,760
Are you serious?

97
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,346
{\an8}I wish Namari could've seen this.

98
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,099
{\an8}Depending on the situation,
she might've killed Senshi.

99
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,436
{\an8}I had a suspicion that she might,
which is why I chose to remain silent.

100
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,773
Take this!

101
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,903
It really pierced through its scale!

102
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,783
<i>But the blade is so short that no matter
where I strike,</i>

103
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:15,912
<i>I might not be able
to deliver a fatal blow.</i>

104
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,048
What should I do now?

105
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,425
This means the plan failed, right?

106
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,011
Or are they executing
a different strategy?

107
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,180
What am I supposed to do?

108
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,684
No time to hesitate!

109
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,686
Get back!

110
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,273
<i>My sword
is getting farther and farther away.</i>

111
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,693
{\an8}If we continue retreating,
we'll end up in the open square.

112
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,196
Then, we'll be turned to cinder
by its fire breath!

113
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,698
I will draw its attention.

114
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,325
Don't! It's too risky!

115
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,453
Laios, you understand, don't you?

116
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:00,915
Among all the monsters
you've eaten so far,

117
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,459
was there one
that didn't give their utmost effort?

118
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,420
In this place,
it's a matter of eat or be eaten.

119
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,715
If we don't make desperate efforts,
we'll be the ones who'll be eaten.

120
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,425
Brace yourself for the worst!

121
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,719
Senshi!

122
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:26,857
-Sen--
-Idiot!

123
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:29,235
There's no point if you rush out!

124
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,112
Retreat for now.

125
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,114
Figure something out with Marcille!

126
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,116
Hey! Are you still alive?

127
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:36,617
{\an8}I'll help you out now--

128
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,581
Can you move?

129
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,553
<i>I did it!</i>

130
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,852
It's stuck to the ground.

131
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,020
Move aside!

132
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,482
Laios!

133
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,279
I'll be right back!

134
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,741
Senshi! Get up!

135
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:18,576
Sen--

136
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,297
Sorry, Marcille.

137
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,049
I didn't expect to find you here.

138
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,635
I'm glad my magic seems to be working.

139
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,763
What's going on? Where are the other two?

140
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,097
Things aren't looking good.

141
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,433
Every strategy we came up with has failed.

142
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,311
The other two are unconscious
at the dragon's feet.

143
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,813
What?! W-What do we do?!

144
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,775
Right, the only option is to use my magic.

145
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,194
The dragon is injured and agitated.

146
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,529
It's risky to approach it
or enter its line of sight.

147
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,948
But we have to do something quickly!

148
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,117
-Let's head upstairs.
-What?

149
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,244
W-What will you do?

150
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,205
I'll climb to the height
of the dragon's head.

151
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,207
-And stand inside the pot.
-What?

152
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,918
Then, I want you to blow it up.

153
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,962
What? Seriously?

154
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,465
<i>The dragon is blind in its left eye.</i>

155
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,092
<i>If I approach from its left side,</i>

156
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,928
I should be able to leap onto it
without being noticed.

157
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,097
But…

158
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,016
<i>You did a similar maneuver before…</i>

159
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,811
<i>when you fought the Undine.</i>

160
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:30,523
But that was on the water with Water-Walk.

161
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,067
This time,
we have defense magic and the pot.

162
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,443
What happens next?

163
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,405
How will you stab its inverse scale
while clinging to its head?

164
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:40,324
I have an idea about that.

165
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,619
There's no room for more failures.

166
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,747
I don't plan on failing.

167
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,003
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

168
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,005
<i>You do have a plan, right?</i>

169
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:56,924
<i>I believe in you.</i>

170
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,706
<i>I'll be flung off.</i>

171
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,708
<i>I need to execute my plan swiftly.</i>

172
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,960
<i>It'll be over in an instant.</i>

173
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,337
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

174
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,048
<i>Especially when compared…</i>

175
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,718
<i>to Falin's pain!</i>

176
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:44,972
Laios!

177
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,747
Laios!

178
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,208
Where are you going?

179
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,710
I heard there's a ghost at the graveyard.

180
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,462
Don't tell Dad or anyone else, okay?

181
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,549
-Whoopee!
-Whoopee!

182
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,222
Don't worry.

183
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,558
It's difficult to walk
with you clinging to me like that.

184
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,482
There's not even a single bug.

185
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,900
Let's head back, Falin.

186
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,654
Laios…

187
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,330
Laios!

188
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,044
<i>Take it off!</i>

189
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,547
<i>Help me.</i>

190
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,799
-<i>Please. Take it off.</i>
-<i>It's cold.</i>

191
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,468
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

192
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,805
Falin, run…

193
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,642
Laios!

194
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,650
Let my brother…

195
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,445
go!

196
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,168
It's someone who was buried in that grave.

197
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,588
His ring is binding his soul.

198
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,340
Remove it for him.

199
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,801
And his soul will be set free.

200
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,637
A ring?

201
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,680
What are you talking about?

202
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:35,476
This is the grave of Olman,
who passed away recently.

203
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,855
When he was alive, he used to boast
about a golden ring he bought from an elf.

204
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,900
How did that child know about it?

205
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,697
Did I do something wrong?

206
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,241
You're incredible, Falin.

207
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,619
You have a knack for ghost magic.

208
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,829
Don't let it bother you.

209
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,998
Grown-ups are just scared of magic.

210
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,377
You should study proper magic.

211
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,087
You'll never be out of a job.

212
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,546
What kind of job?

213
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,547
Let's see.

214
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,050
You could become a priest
or a grave keeper.

215
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,552
Being a traveling exorcist
might be interesting, too.

216
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,642
You travel to foreign countries,
helping people in need.

217
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,477
That sounds fun.

218
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,063
If I do that, will you come with me?

219
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,272
Of course!

220
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,816
What country do you want to visit?

221
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,820
{\an8}I'd love to see the sea.

222
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,863
Or even a desert.

223
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,616
They say there's a country
of talking dogs in the desert.

224
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,285
{\an8}I definitely want to go there!

225
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:37,538
-<i>But…</i>
-<i>But…</i>

226
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:41,417
<i>maybe we shouldn't
travel together anymore.</i>

227
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,420
<i>Falin, why not?</i>

228
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,381
<i>You don't have to worry about me.</i>

229
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,844
<i>Goodbye, Laios.</i>

230
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,765
Laios, are you okay?

231
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,435
I stopped the bleeding for now.

232
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,894
Just hold on a bit longer.

233
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,856
I'll go look for the other two
and for your leg!

234
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,819
<i>"Don't worry about me"?</i>

235
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,364
<i>Don't say sad stuff like that.</i>

236
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,201
<i>I promise to bring you back.</i>

237
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:18,537
Hey!

238
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,998
Chilchuck!

239
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,833
Senshi!

240
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,711
There you are!

241
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,504
Thank goodness!

242
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,922
Are you okay?

243
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,049
Of course, not.

244
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,553
I need to work on my defense magic more.

245
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:38,182
At least we haven't suffered any ruptures,
so that's good enough.

246
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:44,188
{\an8}<i>Tronsum Lunaae Stantinus Eurekant Oonzu.</i>

247
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,691
Ow!

248
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,486
Isn't he in more pain now?

249
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,947
When a serious injury is healed quickly,
you experience recovery pain.

250
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,324
Don't worry!

251
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,159
It's a sign that you've healed properly!

252
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,494
It's your turn, Senshi.

253
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,246
I'm fine. I'll heal on my own.

254
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,790
It could take months.

255
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,375
Falin was skilled at recovery magic,

256
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,170
but I'm pretty confident
in my speed as well.

257
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,215
T-That's the cause of the pain, isn't it?

258
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,925
GAAAAAAH

259
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,218
SNAP POP

260
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,220
Laios!

261
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,055
Come on, lift your leg.

262
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:29,566
<i>Britrayeums Lunae Actum
Asbam Histum Eres Eurekant Ounzu.</i>

263
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,488
It reattached!

264
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,742
The inside of my leg feels itchy.

265
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,744
It's recovery pain.

266
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,247
Well done, Laios.

267
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,500
You really defeated the Red Dragon.

268
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,377
It's thanks to all of you.

269
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,004
If any one of you weren't here,
we couldn't have won.

270
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,757
{\an8}For a moment,
I was afraid of what might happen.

271
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,176
Even my blood froze.

272
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,262
Our estimate was a little too naive.

273
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,223
{\an8}Well, we won, so that's all that matters.

274
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,016
{\an8}But…

275
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,768
Here, Laios.

276
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,853
Kensuke.

277
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:09,022
{\an8}I still haven't forgiven you for this yet.

278
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,733
You owe me a long explanation.

279
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,651
Right.

280
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,281
Well then, let's look inside its stomach.

281
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:28,917
What a thick skin.

282
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,502
Fighting with this cooking knife,

283
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,629
no wonder we couldn't even reach
its subcutaneous fat.

284
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,466
But it's going to be a lot of work
getting to its stomach.

285
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,427
I could try blasting it open.

286
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,930
The insides of a dragon
are no different from any other creature.

287
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,558
Let's slowly carve through its flesh.

288
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,610
It's one of its ribs.

289
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,945
Let's go around it and keep digging.

290
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,284
It's dark. Should we light a lantern?

291
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,577
No fire.

292
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,245
Marcille, light.

293
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,341
It's so hot.

294
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,469
It reminds me
of when I used to work in a mine.

295
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,722
What's this?

296
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,307
{\an8}It's the stomach!

297
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,728
All right.

298
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,230
Let's open it.

299
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,491
It's empty.

300
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,701
It can't be…

301
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,995
Maybe we got the wrong dragon.

302
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,372
That's impossible.

303
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:52,000
The scar above its eye
confirms it's the same dragon.

304
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:58,423
It's difficult to imagine there being
multiple territorial males in one area.

305
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,176
Let's examine its intestines as well.

306
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,973
{\an8}N-Not even a fragment of a bone is left.

307
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:09,184
We have to examine its droppings, too!

308
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:13,730
{\an8}Could its digestion have been sped up
by constant movement without sleep?

309
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,610
I got it!

310
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,923
What is this?

311
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,426
{\an8}A mass of hair and bone.

312
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,636
Some creatures
that ingest their prey whole

313
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,014
tend to regurgitate indigestible parts.

314
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,685
But instead of doing that, Red Dragons
use them as fuel for their fire breath.

315
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:55,772
These black hairs suggest
it consumed a few Wargs.

316
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,940
And…

317
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,446
H-Hair…

318
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,822
Could it be…

319
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,198
Let's sift through the mass.

320
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,617
We might find human bones in it.

321
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,582
Hey, isn't this staff…

322
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,793
Hey, Laios!

323
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,045
This staff!

324
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,009
F…

325
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,845
Falin?
