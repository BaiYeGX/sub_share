1
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,467
DRAGON BONELESS HAM

3
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,261
There's so much meat to process,
I don't know if we can consume it all.

4
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,922
There you are.

5
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,843
What's with your form?

6
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,930
I thought I assigned you the task
of searching for His Majesty.

7
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,892
{\an8}I don't recall permitting you
to take a break.

8
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,983
What was that noise?

9
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,236
Looks like the sword
I had propped up fell over.

10
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,947
You should tie it in place.

11
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,284
Falin?

12
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,203
Marcille.

13
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,998
Where did Falin go?

14
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,500
Huh?

15
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,336
Senshi, do you know
where Falin took off to?

16
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,505
I haven't seen anyone walk by.

17
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,758
What is it? Is something wrong?

18
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,386
Don't tell me…

19
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,598
she left through this window.

20
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,060
I'll go take a look outside.

21
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,520
Huh?

22
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,364
What the…

23
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,617
Falin!

24
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,870
Are you okay?

25
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,663
What happened--

26
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,543
What happened here?

27
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,298
{\an8}Lord Delgal… I have to look for him.

28
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,550
Delgal? Who's that?

29
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,885
Everything…

30
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,804
Everything that exists on this earth,

31
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:48,394
every building, gold coin,
citizen, cattle, blood, flesh…

32
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:53,483
Even the grain of sand beneath your feet,

33
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:59,614
belongs to His Majesty, King Delgal.

34
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,911
You dirty thief.

35
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,414
I remember spotting you,

36
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,834
skulking inside the paintings.

37
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,378
<i>He remembers me?</i>

38
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,004
<i>The King?</i>

39
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,673
<i>Inside the paintings?</i>

40
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,843
Who are you? What is your purpose?

41
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,392
<i>He's the lord of the dungeon…</i>

42
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,811
<i>The lunatic magician!</i>

43
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,901
H-Hey, you! Step back!

44
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,194
Next time, I won't miss!

45
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,075
You damn usurpers!

46
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,286
Falin, can you get up?

47
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,453
Falin!

48
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,831
{\an8}Shut up!

49
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,586
{\an8}Laios!

50
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,338
What incredible strength.

51
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:00,091
What the hell is going on?

52
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,592
Is that guy an adventurer?

53
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,513
Huh? What's with the book?

54
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,598
I've got a really bad feeling about this.

55
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,893
<i>Evunt Ornbam Romfes Roodbam Unt Leshfam.</i>

56
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,854
Is it just me,
or is he chanting something?

57
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:16,524
<i>Evunt Ornbam Romfes Roodbam Unt Leshfam.</i>

58
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,109
This incantation…

59
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:22,613
<i>Evunt Ornbam Romfes Roodbam Unt Leshfam.</i>

60
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,490
<i>It's ancient magic!</i>

61
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,867
Devour!

62
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,420
<i>Explosive spells, defense magic,</i>

63
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,547
<i>none of that can halt this attack!</i>

64
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,923
<i>In that case…</i>

65
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,557
<i>I'll directly overwrite the spell!</i>

66
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,441
Cancel!

67
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,991
Cancel!

68
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,327
<i>This ancient magic…</i>

69
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,330
<i>I can understand and decipher it, but!</i>

70
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,003
<i>I can't keep up with it!</i>

71
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,509
BONELESS DRAGON HAM

72
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:30,515
BONELESS DRAGON HAM

73
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,777
A-Are you the maker of this dungeon?

74
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,030
I'd like to have a chat with--

75
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,302
No need to fear.

76
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,304
The traitors have gone.

77
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,559
His Majesty will return soon.

78
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,353
When he does,
let us hold a grand celebration.

79
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:20,940
Hey, Dragon.

80
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,945
This form must be inconvenient for you.

81
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,198
I'll provide you with a new one.

82
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:39,709
Do what needs to be done.

83
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:42,962
As you command.

84
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,383
Ow.

85
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,801
What's going on?

86
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,387
Hold on, I'll provide light.

87
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,726
What is this place?

88
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,312
{\an8}Where did we fall from, anyway?

89
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,981
{\an8}What the heck? Where's the exit--

90
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,234
What now?

91
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,778
I think the walls are closing in!

92
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,489
You've got to be kidding me! Dammit!

93
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,324
The exit! Search for an exit!

94
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,617
Where?!

95
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,993
Can't you magic us out of here?

96
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,245
Using what magic exactly?

97
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,880
<i>We're going to die.</i>

98
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,424
<i>It's not my first time dying,</i>

99
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,635
<i>but no one will find us
under these stones.</i>

100
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,096
<i>I finally reunited with Falin</i>

101
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,557
<i>and took a step closer
to unraveling the dungeon's mystery.</i>

102
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,143
<i>Now all of that is going to mean nothing!</i>

103
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,979
<i>I don't want to die like this!</i>

104
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,443
Marcille!

105
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,031
It's a hole! We can escape through here!

106
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,992
We don't know where it leads!

107
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,036
Anything's better than getting squashed!

108
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,539
Just hurry!

109
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,757
Where are we?

110
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,425
It's freezing!

111
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,429
Anyway, we've got to get out of here.

112
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,430
Not happening.

113
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:20,142
I can't even budge a finger.

114
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:21,936
You have to try.

115
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,021
If that guy finds us again…

116
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,864
<i>We're toast.</i>

117
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,462
T-They vanished.

118
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,091
Damn, it feels like
my head's about to explode.

119
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:56,345
Senshi, wake Laios up.

120
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,015
I'll scout around this area.

121
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,188
Get him!

122
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,024
Where did these bastards sneak in from?

123
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,859
There's a long-ears too!

124
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,194
-He went that way!
-You little!

125
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,363
Quiet!

126
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:15,781
What's the matter?

127
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,366
Moles, Captain.

128
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,160
How did they get in?

129
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,953
What were the guards doing?

130
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,914
{\an8}We're not sure.

131
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:25,416
{\an8}<i>The hole is sealed.</i>

132
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:26,876
{\an8}Whatever.

133
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,544
A little man,

134
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,880
a depths-dweller,

135
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,383
a long-legs, and a long-ears!

136
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,052
Interesting.

137
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,764
I've never killed a long-ears before.
I'll handle it.

138
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,266
Give the little man to the dogs.

139
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,268
They're craving some entertainment.

140
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:45,686
Wait.

141
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,523
You are Chief Zon's sister, aren't you?

142
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:54,070
We have come to fulfill
our promise to your chief.

143
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,280
We ask that you treat us kindly.

144
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,033
{\an8}How do you know that name?

145
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,118
Huh?

146
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,915
You're the vegetable seller!

147
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,667
You smelled different,
so we didn't recognize you!

148
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,171
What brings you all the way down here?

149
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,715
{\an8}What promise did you make to our Chief?

150
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,676
I see.

151
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,513
So that's what happened.

152
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:24,600
I was curious why the Dragon
had disappeared all of a sudden.

153
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,978
I thank you on behalf of the Chief.

154
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,522
Prepare the concoction.

155
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,365
It's ready.

156
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,076
ORC CONCOCTION

157
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,221
U-Um…

158
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,099
I'm just…

159
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,476
out of…

160
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,603
magic…

161
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,737
H-Hey.

162
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,615
We were attacked by an elf magician.

163
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:24,618
Do you know anything about him?

164
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,953
You've encountered him?

165
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,832
He had brown skin and silver hair…

166
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,875
That's the one.

167
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,627
We don't know a lot about him.

168
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,381
He's been around
long before we settled here.

169
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,633
And it seems he's the one
governing this dungeon.

170
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:44,388
Whenever outsiders
excessively meddle with the dungeon,

171
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,390
that's when he shows up.

172
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:51,228
<i>He creates monsters,
controls them at will, alters the terrain,</i>

173
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:54,482
<i>and can kill any creature
by simply flipping through his book.</i>

174
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,902
{\an8}The ruler of the dungeon…

175
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:58,903
{\an8}That means…

176
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:03,407
we've caught the attention
of the lunatic magician!

177
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,742
That's no joke!

178
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,495
Damn, we've got to get out of here fast!

179
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,456
Was it Marcille's magic that lured him?

180
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,917
No, maybe it's because
we took down the Red Dragon.

181
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,795
He has a few monsters under his command,

182
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,673
and when you kill them,
you end up ticking him off.

183
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:21,800
So that's what my brother
was worried about,

184
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:26,180
and why he warned us not to mess
with the Red Dragon.

185
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,599
My brother is always right.

186
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,142
<i>That bastard!</i>

187
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,813
Once these two wake up,
they'll want to find Falin for sure.

188
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,316
But I have to make them give up somehow.

189
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,068
How?

190
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,569
Anything that does the trick!

191
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,904
We can burn Marcille's staff

192
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,323
or tell them we spotted Falin
heading to the surface.

193
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:47,743
Or that we should be content
after having Dragon meat.

194
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,704
{\an8}So, you're proposing we deceive them?

195
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,164
I am!

196
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,709
Otherwise, these idiots
would never let it go!

197
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:59,004
If we go any deeper,
we're definitely going to get killed.

198
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,714
Do you want to become a part of the wall?

199
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,466
Because I sure don't!

200
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,101
{\an8}I have no intention of joining them
just to end up dead.

201
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,728
Hey,

202
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:17,356
I want to go retrieve my stuff
that I left behind.

203
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,984
Could you show me the way?

204
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,821
No way.

205
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,740
I don't want the stench of spinelessness
rubbing off on me.

206
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,327
I ask you as well.

207
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,246
Please take him there.

208
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,374
{\an8}He might be faint-hearted,
but he's not a bad fellow.

209
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,002
{\an8}Senshi, aren't you coming with me?

210
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,630
One of us should stay with those two.

211
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,798
But…

212
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,638
You know I can't say no to you.

213
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,725
I'd rather not, but I'll show him the way.

214
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:00,941
<i>Damn it.</i>

215
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,612
<i>They're a bunch of fools,
every last one of them!</i>

216
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,072
Did you get separated from a companion?

217
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,908
Yeah.

218
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:13,537
The last we saw of her, she was lying
on the ground near the magician's feet.

219
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,915
It's tough to be hopeful about that.

220
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,752
That doesn't justify
lying to your friends.

221
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,339
Easy for someone on the outside to say.

222
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,216
No, forget I said that!

223
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,010
Behind you.

224
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,428
Huh?

225
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,268
Don't panic.

226
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,186
It's cold!

227
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,772
That's one of the city's residents.

228
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:43,359
The spirits here are still sane

229
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,111
and only appear when they want to be seen.

230
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,406
The routes they take are safe.

231
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,574
Let's follow.

232
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,533
Huh?

233
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,704
You better be right.

234
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,635
{\an8}That's the place
we were at a little while ago.

235
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,304
The Red Dragon is gone.

236
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,141
It didn't resurrect, did it?

237
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,059
No.

238
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,145
{\an8}The dogs aren't on high alert.

239
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,315
{\an8}Either the magician made it disappear
or took it with him.

240
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,151
There are traces of an explosion, though.

241
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:30,072
We started a fire near
the Dragon's fuel bag, and it ignited.

242
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,074
I'm surprised you survived that.

243
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:36,537
One of our party members
quickly shielded us with defense magic,

244
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,205
<i>so we were unharmed.</i>

245
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,666
You're lucky to have such friends.

246
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,585
You're not getting it.

247
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,131
Even she didn't know
she could use that magic.

248
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,717
We could've all blown up, healer included.

249
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,845
Ultimately, the magic worked,

250
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,639
but if it had failed,
it would have made her a fool.

251
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,475
They're all like that.

252
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:06,233
How did you manage to defeat
the Red Dragon on your own, anyway?

253
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,197
{\an8}Senshi and I distracted it,
and Laios, the tall-man in our party,

254
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,576
{\an8}jumped into the Red Dragon's chest
and struck its weak point.

255
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,619
That's impressive.

256
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,248
A warrior should have courage.

257
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,584
<i>It wasn't courage.</i>

258
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:27,880
{\an8}It turned out okay,
but it was a stupid gamble.

259
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,799
<i>Honestly, it sent shivers down my spine.</i>

260
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,094
<i>Someone who'd make that kind of call,
there's no telling where they'll end up!</i>

261
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,723
<i>There were a few members
who left our party,</i>

262
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,562
but looking back,
maybe they were the smarter ones.

263
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,900
I should have been less stubborn
and followed suit as well.

264
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,280
Are you saying it would have been better
to lose your friends?

265
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,116
I don't know.

266
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,496
{\an8}Maybe my decision to join Laios

267
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,165
made it harder for him to back out.

268
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,544
Anyway, what happened after that?

269
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:11,006
We healed our wounds
and patched ourselves up.

270
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,258
And in this room…

271
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,974
We cooked up the Dragon's meat and ate it.

272
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,059
As you should.

273
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:24,436
It's your rightful reward
for bringing it down.

274
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,776
Was it after that
when the magician showed up?

275
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,570
How did you manage
to survive the encounter?

276
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,534
The mage in our party
held up against his attacks.

277
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,786
That long-ears?

278
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,247
She seemed so clueless, though.

279
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,040
{\an8}Trust me, she is.

280
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,292
She used some shady magic back there.

281
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,755
Even if she makes it out of the dungeon,
I doubt she could lead a decent life.

282
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,426
They're stupid idiots.
Every last one of them.

283
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,262
{\an8}They're a bunch of fools.

284
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:01,765
They believe that if they
try hard enough, they'll be rewarded.

285
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,977
How am I supposed to reason
with folks like that?

286
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,688
So, you're going to trick them?

287
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,149
There must be a better way.

288
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:15,028
If a couple of lies get me back
on the surface, I'm all for it!

289
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,446
I'm a coward, after all!

290
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,408
My life comes first, over everything!

291
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,660
Don't be like that.

292
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,832
Just admit you don't want to see them die.

293
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,431
What's this sucker doing here?

294
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,642
Did it crawl all the way up here?

295
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,526
Turns out, you were the smartest among us.

296
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,948
<i>Bloodstains…</i>

297
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,868
Like someone dragged a body along…

298
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,620
Hey.

299
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,954
Do you want to be left behind?

300
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,081
C-Coming.

301
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,590
I grabbed our stuff.

302
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,220
What do you think you're doing?!

303
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,846
You need to stay put!

304
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,139
I'm not feeling any pain.

305
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,017
That's because the medicine
is messing with your sense of pain!

306
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,853
{\an8}Falin should still be nearby!

307
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,023
Calm down.

308
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,989
I've got something to say to you both.

309
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,910
Chilchuck, I've been thinking, and…

310
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,621
Let me go first.

311
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,749
Laios,

312
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,671
I can't even begin to imagine
how you must be feeling.

313
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,925
{\an8}But we can't continue
the search like this.

314
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,429
{\an8}It's going to end up
with one of us kicking the bucket.

315
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,599
Please, Laios.

316
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,187
{\an8}Please be strong for now
and head back above ground!

317
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,815
I don't want to lose you guys!

318
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,110
My feelings might not match
the affection you have for your sister,

319
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,695
but I've got the three of you to lose!

320
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,197
Informing the Lord of the Island
about the lunatic magician

321
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,407
may prompt some action.

322
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,076
Maybe we could gather funds
to enlist help!

323
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,163
{\an8}With enough preparation,
we can reach this level quicker next time!

324
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,959
So, please…

325
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,338
Let's head back, Laios.

326
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,344
To tell you the truth,

327
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:48,849
we're running short
on seasoning and other ingredients.

328
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,228
I want to make sure we can whip up
something delicious for Falin.

329
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,106
We should head back to the city
and replenish our supplies.

330
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,194
I've sent word
that the Red Dragon's been slain.

331
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:04,114
My brother should return
with the others soon.

332
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:08,618
When you're ready and return down here,

333
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,414
we'll do what we can to help you out.

334
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:16,710
{\an8}All right.

335
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,424
Forgive me for making you worry.

336
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,886
Let's head back.

337
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:28,805
Yeah.

338
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,938
