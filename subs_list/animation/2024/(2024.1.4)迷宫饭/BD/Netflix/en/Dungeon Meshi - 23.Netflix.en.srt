1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,927
It wasn't just a myth, after all!

3
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,305
That fallen ancient kingdom
actually existed!

4
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,810
This is pure gold.

5
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,061
Incredible.

6
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,062
Hey…

7
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,857
Shouldn't we head back up
to the surface once?

8
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,568
If we want to explore,
we should be better prepared.

9
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,279
Stop talking nonsense.

10
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,364
Senshi,

11
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,325
are you sure you have
iron flowing in your veins?

12
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,868
Don't push yourself.

13
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,453
You wait here.

14
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,957
I want gold too!

15
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,961
{\an8}<i>I was terrified
of being left behind, so I lied.</i>

16
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,381
<i>That place just didn't sit right with me.</i>

17
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,592
<i>And although many of my group
were ambitious from the start,</i>

18
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,053
<i>they were acting weird then.</i>

19
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,265
<i>Their eyes were gleaming in the dark,</i>

20
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:24,352
<i>and they kept plunging deeper and deeper
like they were being pulled in.</i>

21
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,231
<i>Then suddenly, it began.</i>

22
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,026
What happened?

23
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:36,114
A-A monster!

24
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:39,117
A giant bird monster
showed up out of nowhere

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,244
and took out Totan!

26
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,204
This isn't just some old ruins.

27
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,039
It's turned into a dungeon!

28
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,878
<i>By the time fear had jolted everyone
back to themselves,</i>

29
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:52,297
<i>we realized we'd lost our way back.</i>

30
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,259
What if we've been trapped in here?

31
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,763
All dungeons
have a way out to the surface.

32
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,017
Let's keep our cool
and hunt for that exit.

33
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:08,479
<i>We kept roaming the dungeon,
avoiding any monsters.</i>

34
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,525
<i>Curiously,</i><i>when we became thirsty,
we stumbled upon springs.</i>

35
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,070
<i>When we were exhausted,
rooms would pop up for us to rest in.</i>

36
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,659
<i>Some even got tempted
by a gorgeous woman in the shadows.</i>

37
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,788
<i>Eventually, our food ran out.</i>

38
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,291
If we keep going like this,
we'll starve and die.

39
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,044
We must find something to eat,
even if it means fighting.

40
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,337
Something to eat?

41
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,798
Even monsters must feed on something.

42
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,383
Invar, Brigan!

43
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:40,470
Use your shields to be on guard.

44
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,556
Null and I will fend off monsters
with our weapons.

45
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,933
Senshi…

46
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,978
You stay put
and work on mapping out this area.

47
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,064
Let's go!

48
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,864
That bird monster showed up again!

49
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:03,451
That damn thing flies off too fast.

50
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,288
I-I'll join you on the next food hunt!

51
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,457
No, you'll just slow us down.

52
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,626
We've found food.

53
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,336
Here, have this.

54
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,839
<i>Even though I wasn't exerting myself,
I still became hungry.</i>

55
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,259
<i>I felt so pathetic.</i>

56
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,222
<i>Our daily hunt for food
became more urgent than finding the exit.</i>

57
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,892
<i>The bird kept on our tails relentlessly.</i>

58
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,228
<i>With each fight, our numbers dwindled.</i>

59
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,729
<i>Finally, with nothing else to eat,</i>

60
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,482
<i>we had to resort to killing our horse.</i>

61
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,486
That four-legged eagle…
there's no mistaking it.

62
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,072
It's a monster called a Griffin.

63
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,574
Why is it so fixated on us?

64
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,868
It doesn't seem like
it's hungry or anything.

65
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,289
It probably just enjoys
the thrill of the kill.

66
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,583
They say monsters are like that.

67
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:55,837
Don't worry.

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,881
Next time it swoops in,
we'll roast it whole and feast on it.

69
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,218
Here. Be grateful to Anne and eat up.

70
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,308
What's up with you,

71
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,519
giving the biggest portion
to the useless brat?

72
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,772
He's only 36 and still needs to grow.

73
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,942
As grown-ups,
it's our duty to take care of him.

74
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,277
We can't afford to do that!

75
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,364
{\an8}It's over for us when we can't look after
the next generation anymore!

76
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,419
<i>I'm so hungry.</i>

77
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,714
<i>If iron really does flow through my veins,</i>

78
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,216
<i>I wonder if I can munch on rocks.</i>

79
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,176
Hey!

80
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,553
You've got a hidden stash of food,
haven't you?

81
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,930
Stop it! What's gotten into you?

82
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,515
That brat!

83
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,559
Let's discuss this outside.

84
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,811
You're scaring Senshi.

85
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,314
-How many times do I have to tell you?
-Why you! Shut up!

86
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,317
<i>The shouting kept getting louder.</i>

87
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,071
<i>I heard the sounds of scuffling
and a few screams.</i>

88
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,206
<i>Then, it went eerily silent.</i>

89
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,501
What happened?

90
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:17,418
Where's Brigan?

91
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,711
Stay put!

92
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,214
Don't look outside.

93
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,926
We were attacked by the Griffin.

94
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,930
I took down the Griffin,
but Brigan died instantly.

95
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,682
<i>When I looked at Gillin's head,</i>

96
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:35,520
<i>there was a dent in his helmet,
like it had been hit by a blunt object.</i>

97
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,314
Let's eat the Griffin.

98
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,317
If we clean it and make a soup out of it,

99
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,528
we could survive a few more days.

100
00:06:55,873 --> 00:07:01,170
<i>The Griffin soup, just boiled with water,
had a gamey smell and the meat was tough.</i>

101
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,880
<i>It tasted awful.</i>

102
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,510
<i>But I chewed intently</i>

103
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,055
<i>and downed it slowly, taking my time.</i>

104
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,101
<i>Gillin said he needed to relieve himself,</i>

105
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,228
<i>and stepped outside unsteadily.</i>

106
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,108
<i>But he never returned.</i>

107
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,819
<i>I found myself all alone.</i>

108
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:29,115
<i>I lacked the courage
to peek outside the door,</i>

109
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,826
<i>and I was unable to leave the room.</i>

110
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,872
<i>I survived on the meat that was left</i>

111
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,332
<i>and pored over the maps I had sketched.</i>

112
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,378
<i>Eventually, I noticed a pattern
in the symbols etched on the walls.</i>

113
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,756
<i>When I finally gathered the courage
to step out of the room…</i>

114
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,096
<i>there were no bodies to be found.</i>

115
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,892
<i>They must have been devoured cleanly
by various creatures.</i>

116
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,812
<i>Later, I was captured by orcs,</i>

117
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,982
<i>and held captive
in their settlement for some time.</i>

118
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:07,069
<i>But when I tried to communicate with them,
they turned out to be quite decent folk.</i>

119
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,655
<i>In exchange for teaching them
ancient Dwarvish,</i>

120
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,201
<i>they taught me how to distinguish
between edible and poisonous mushrooms,</i>

121
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,786
<i>and how to handle encounters
with monsters.</i>

122
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,040
<i>And that's how…</i>

123
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,298
<i>I made it back to the surface.</i>

124
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,969
<i>But after everything that happened,</i>

125
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,805
<i>I couldn't find it in me
to return to my hometown.</i>

126
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,309
<i>So, I lived near the dungeon
or in its upper levels.</i>

127
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,396
<i>Eventually, the city on the surface
connected with the dungeon,</i>

128
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,191
<i>and many adventurers began venturing down.</i>

129
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,193
<i>What weighed on my mind</i>

130
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,906
<i>was whether the meat I consumed
truly came from the Griffin.</i>

131
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,826
<i>Every time I eat,
I'm haunted by the taste of that soup.</i>

132
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,706
<i>No other monster
tasted anything like that.</i>

133
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,418
That's why I fled from the Griffin.

134
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,132
I'm afraid of discovering the truth.

135
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,968
I had no idea…

136
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,886
Senshi…

137
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,723
Then why not try eating that Griffin?

138
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:18,849
-Huh?
-Huh?

139
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,102
I mean, it's awful for him

140
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,730
to be haunted by that memory every time
he eats for the rest of his life.

141
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,774
If it tastes the same,
he can put his mind at ease.

142
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,818
And if it's completely different,

143
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,238
well, it's a shame,
but at least it won't plague him anymore.

144
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,198
It's going to plague him even more.

145
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,533
What's with him?

146
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,702
What do you think, Senshi?

147
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,623
You're right.

148
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,125
I should try it.

149
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,876
Senshi…

150
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:47,795
All right then!

151
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,424
Let's recreate the cooking
as closely as possible.

152
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,801
We'll cut out the meat
without doing much to it.

153
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,138
Since the upper body and lower body
might taste completely different,

154
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,264
we'll take cuts from both.

155
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:00,141
You just want to eat it.

156
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,314
That's some impressive muscle.

157
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,024
It's not a carnivore for nothing.

158
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,819
Why did the Griffin pursue
Senshi and his group so relentlessly?

159
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,281
It might have killed people,
but it didn't seem keen on eating them.

160
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,117
They had a horse though.

161
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,160
Maybe that's why.

162
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,037
Griffins have a penchant for horses.

163
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,248
But then why didn't it target
the horse first?

164
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,166
No idea.

165
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,668
I'll get some water boiling.

166
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,715
<i>The Griffin's weapons
are its front claws and beak.</i>

167
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,552
<i>It can't leave a dent on you
like you were hit by a blunt object.</i>

168
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,930
<i>So whatever killed Brigan
probably wasn't a Griffin.</i>

169
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,434
<i>But what about the other three?</i>

170
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,854
<i>Just like how we mistook
Falin for a Griffin,</i>

171
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,148
<i>maybe it was
a different monster altogether.</i>

172
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,859
<i>There are many large monsters with wings.</i>

173
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,821
<i>The Cockatrice, Basilisk, Harpy, Siren,</i>

174
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,908
<i>Pegasus, Simurgh, and Roc.</i>

175
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,411
<i>Which of these monsters possesses
a weapon resembling a blunt object?</i>

176
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,872
The water's boiling.

177
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,541
Do we just let it boil like this?

178
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,335
Should we add other ingredients?

179
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,544
No, that's it.

180
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,089
<i>It's going to be a bland soup.</i>

181
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,508
<i>It'd be nice if we had some garnish.</i>

182
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,930
By the way, you mentioned that the orcs
taught you how to distinguish mushrooms.

183
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,015
But is this your first time
seeing these mushrooms?

184
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,809
Yeah, I've never seen them before.

185
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,979
Marcille, I'm leaving the rest to you.

186
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,564
-Huh? Hey!
-Huh?

187
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,942
You've come this far,
and now you're backing out?

188
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,068
So flighty!

189
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:36,278
Fine, forget it then.

190
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,239
This won't help Senshi anyway.

191
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,450
No, we've come this far, so let me try it.

192
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,036
I'll accept whatever truth awaits me.

193
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,169
GRIFFIN SOUP (UPPER BODY)
(LOWER BODY)

194
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,212
It's done.

195
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,970
This…

196
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,849
doesn't taste anything like
what I had that day.

197
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,312
What I ate back then must have been…

198
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,273
You mean…

199
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,190
It's fine.

200
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,151
A weight has been lifted.

201
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,196
Gillin must have wanted me to survive,
no matter what.

202
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,158
I'll carry on with that wish.

203
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,118
Laios, you moron!

204
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,536
What have you done?!

205
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:32,376
Griffin meat is very gamey and tough.

206
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,795
More than anything,
the aftertaste is just awful.

207
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,089
{\an8}That's right.

208
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,301
{\an8}Senshi didn't eat Griffin meat that day.

209
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,888
But it wasn't human flesh either!

210
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,558
What attacked them was a Hippogriff,
not a Griffin.

211
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,185
A Hippogriff?

212
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,479
Unlike a Griffin,
which has the lower body of a lion,

213
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,522
a Hippogriff
is a close relative of a horse.

214
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,067
It likely kept chasing them down
because they had a horse.

215
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,445
Maybe it was curious or in heat.

216
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,948
Plus, a Hippogriff
has a weapon a Griffin lacks.

217
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,743
<i>Hind legs with hooves.</i>

218
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:09,997
<i>Its kick could tear through metal,
leaving a sizable hole.</i>

219
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,667
I assure you, Senshi!

220
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,504
If what you had that day was a Hippogriff,

221
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,340
then it's only natural
it would taste different from this soup.

222
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,803
Thank you, Laios.

223
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,515
I feel a bit better hearing that.

224
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,477
Even though there's no way
to confirm what a Hippogriff tastes like.

225
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,397
{\an8}Let's find out then.

226
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,982
{\an8}-Huh?
-Huh?

227
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,735
{\an8}Let's compare it to Hippogriff meat.

228
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:42,446
I thought you were going
to wrap it up with something like,

229
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,908
"The truth remains uncertain,
but now there's a glimmer of hope."

230
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,827
I mean, where would we
even find a Hippogriff?

231
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,496
Well,

232
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,123
we have a Hippogriff right here!

233
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,252
There must have been reports of one
in this dungeon in the past.

234
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,796
{\an8}So why didn't we notice them?

235
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,591
{\an8}Because we were fighting a Griffin
that shouldn't even be in this dungeon.

236
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,509
{\an8}Why is that?

237
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:07,137
Because the presence
of an accomplice complicated things.

238
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,014
An accomplice?

239
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,142
Changelings.

240
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,480
Now that I think about it,
that legend comes from your hometown.

241
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,191
Ever heard of Changeling Children?

242
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,278
It's a phenomenon
where children are swapped with monsters.

243
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:27,783
<i>A child who goes to play in the woods
returns home as an identical troll.</i>

244
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,661
<i>For a long time, they were believed
to be a type of magic.</i>

245
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,912
<i>But recently,</i>

246
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:35,165
<i>it's been discovered that it's the work
of these mushroom-like monsters.</i>

247
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,920
<i>Those who step into a ring of them
undergo a subtle change.</i>

248
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,839
Once people learned about this,

249
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,133
they eradicated the mushrooms,
and now they're rare.

250
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,010
To think we'd find them growing here.

251
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,388
<i>The way the Griffin seized Senshi
but didn't eat him.</i>

252
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,516
<i>The sharp kick that killed the Familiar.</i>

253
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,103
<i>It's likely that
the Griffin we fought was actually…</i>

254
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,105
Let's find out.

255
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,152
Place Griffin meat
inside a Changeling fairy ring.

256
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,489
The meat looks different.

257
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,909
It's marbled with fat and looks delicious.

258
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,369
All right, let's make soup from this.

259
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,918
HIPPOGRIFF SOUP

260
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,770
S-Senshi?

261
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,273
W-Well, flavors can vary depending on
conditions and environments,

262
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:42,775
so I wouldn't worry about it…

263
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,945
No. That's not it.

264
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,906
I've been wanting

265
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,493
to taste this soup again for a long time.

266
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,041
<i>Thank you, everyone.</i>

267
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,252
Thank you.

268
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:09,760
Living in this dungeon for a long time
has made me realize something.

269
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:13,681
This dungeon responds strongly
to a person's desires,

270
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,017
whether it's wealth, knowledge, or fame.

271
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:22,940
It's accommodating to those like orcs
who don't seek anything from it.

272
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,276
But the moment you desire something,
it shows its fangs.

273
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,445
From now on,

274
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,951
<i>not only will you aim to rescue Falin,
but you'll also be searching</i>

275
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:36,537
<i>for the lunatic magician
and the Winged Lion.</i>

276
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:40,541
The dungeon's response
will become even more severe.

277
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,042
Still,

278
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,964
there are many things I want to teach you.

279
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,341
Will you take me with you?

280
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,427
Of course!

281
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,975
Okay, everyone!

282
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,435
Let's get going!

283
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,028
How are you all feeling?

284
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,405
I'm feeling cold.

285
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,364
I might not make it.

286
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,909
{\an8}<i>This has to be food poisoning, right?</i>

287
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,413
{\an8}<i>I mean, we've eaten all sorts of things.</i>

288
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,583
{\an8}<i>But we can't afford to die here.</i>

289
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,334
<i>Falin…</i>

290
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,590
<i>How long was I out?</i>

291
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:30,841
<i>I feel lighter.</i>

292
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,218
<i>Has the food poisoning passed?</i>

293
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,386
<i>Good.</i>

294
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,221
<i>I was afraid that…</i>

295
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,976
What's going on?

296
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,228
Marcille.

297
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,521
Look at me.

298
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,356
Does my body look strange to you?

299
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,613
Marcille has shrunk too!

300
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,947
Senshi, this is bad!

301
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,491
Wake up! Sen--

302
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:58,869
W-Who are you?!

303
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,831
What's with all the racket?

304
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,832
Chil…

305
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,752
Chilchuck, sir?

306
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:14,843
It looks like
we stepped on some Changelings.

307
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,805
H-How is this even possible?

308
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,474
They transformed a Griffin
into a Hippogriff.

309
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,893
They could do this to people.

310
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,645
I'm a dwarf now.

311
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,396
Senshi is an elf.

312
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,649
Marcille is a half-foot?

313
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,651
And Chilchuck is a tall-man.

314
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:32,569
Izutsumi…

315
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,196
is a dog.

316
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,448
No, I think that's a kobold.

317
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,117
A kobold with cat ears.

318
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:39,910
Now,

319
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:42,663
how do we get back our bodies?

320
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,415
We'll have to retrace our steps.

321
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,168
If we step inside a mushroom ring,
we'll be able to revert, right?

322
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,337
That's my assumption,

323
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,672
but take a look outside.

324
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,049
The path has shifted.

325
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,553
While we were laid up,
I couldn't stop shaking.

326
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,514
Are you saying it was the dungeon,
not my body, that was shaking?

327
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:02,933
I'm not sure we can make it back,

328
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,685
but let's return to the reservoir.

329
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,191
<i>The luggage feels really light.</i>

330
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,194
Marcille, I'll carry some of your stuff.

331
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,821
Thanks.

332
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,157
<i>I'm liking this body.</i>

333
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,242
<i>I can see well in the dark.</i>

334
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,828
<i>I might even be able to beat Namari
in an arm wrestle now.</i>

335
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,205
Chilchuck, how's that body of yours?

336
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,586
It feels like I'm enveloped in a heavy,
transparent, and thick membrane.

337
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,505
So, your senses are dulled?

338
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,715
Yeah.

339
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,176
But it's strangely calming.

340
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:41,471
Oh, and it's also nice to be able
to look down on you guys.

341
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,623
Wait, is this door…

342
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,713
Ugh, this is where
we were originally headed!

343
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,340
The deepest point, huh?

344
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,885
We intended to turn back,
but ended up pressing forward.

345
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,221
Someone set up camp here.

346
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,140
It seems other adventurers have been here.

347
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,311
Do you think
they might know how to fix us?

348
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,690
I doubt they ventured beyond this door.

349
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,276
They might have already
teleported back to the surface.

350
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,904
What do we do then?

351
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,906
{\an8}I've been thinking…

352
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,533
{\an8}why don't we continue searching
for the Winged Lion like this?

353
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,534
{\an8}Huh?

354
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:48,455
The dungeon
doesn't seem inclined to release us.

355
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,709
Instead of wasting time resisting it,
it might be quicker to press onward.

356
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,044
Of course,

357
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,005
once we make it back to the surface,
I'm sure there'll be plenty of solutions.

358
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,091
I'm not suggesting
we stay like this forever.

359
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:00,092
{\an8}That's absurd!

360
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,970
{\an8}Just because you've become
a long-lived race…

361
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,304
{\an8}He has a point.

362
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,641
{\an8}I haven't experienced
any inconvenience so far.

363
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,560
{\an8}So what if the size of our ears
is a little different anyway?

364
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,232
Say we press on then.

365
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,484
What's the plan for that door?

366
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,820
Everyone's fussing
because it won't open, right?

367
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,364
Do you think you can unlock it, Chilchuck?

368
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,909
Well, it'd need to have a lock
in the first place.

369
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,828
I think it operates with magic.

370
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,373
I can sense magic flowing through it,

371
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,084
but deciphering it would require
time, equipment, and money.

372
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,006
Yaad, what do we do about this?!

373
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,134
Help us, Winged Lion!

374
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,051
-Hey!
-Hey!

375
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,594
Hey!

376
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,680
Laios, something's sprouting!

377
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,974
Kensuke?!

378
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,601
Why is it growing?

379
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,855
I thought the bitter cold had killed it.

380
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,195
The door…

381
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,158
Do you think
the Winged Lion is helping us?

382
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,368
It could be thanks to Yaad.

383
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,078
We should thank them all the same.

384
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:14,207
-Thanks, Lion or Yaad!
-Thanks, Lion or Yaad!

385
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,754
There! I thought I saw something move!

386
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,847
It's a Gargoyle!

387
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:30,766
Here it comes!

388
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,351
As you can see,
Gargoyles are moving stone statues.

389
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,521
Striking them will only end up
hurting you, so be careful.

390
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,399
{\an8}<i>There's nothing I can do here.</i>

391
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,485
{\an8}<i>I'll back off so I won't get in their way.</i>

392
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:46,406
Huh? Why is it coming after me?

393
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,617
Because you stand out the most!

394
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,036
You're big, so you should fight too!

395
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,621
Don't be ridiculous! I can't--

396
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,709
Chilchuck!

397
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,586
It's okay! It wasn't a direct hit--

398
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,050
{\an8}Marcille?!

399
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:08,053
{\an8}E-Everything's swirling
with rainbow colors.

400
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,514
{\an8}Is it mana sickness? With just one attack?

401
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,848
{\an8}This is bad.

402
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,142
{\an8}Izutsumi, cover Chilchuck's back.

403
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,312
Stay!

404
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,355
No, Izutsumi.

405
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,690
Don't move until I say so!

406
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,568
<i>The loud noises and the smell of blood
are getting her all riled up.</i>

407
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,363
<i>If she starts fighting,
she won't stop until she's dead.</i>

408
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,739
Senshi, grab the pot!

409
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,576
Senshi? Why aren't you holding anything?

410
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,578
Because it's too heavy.

411
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,627
<i>Never mind. The sword and pot
feel much lighter than usual.</i>

412
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,338
<i>At this rate, I can win on my own.</i>

413
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,256
<i>Except…</i>

414
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:46,883
<i>how do I put it?</i>

415
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,510
<i>This body…</i>

416
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,012
<i>is really exhausting!</i>

417
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,014
<i>Damn, we're going to lose.</i>

418
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,100
Everyone, get out of here!

419
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,769
Senshi, carry Marcille
and head behind that door.

420
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,271
Izutsumi.

421
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,815
Follow this bell!

422
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,402
Chilchuck, take this pot lid!

423
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,445
Run for it!

424
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,626
Oh no.

425
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,088
This body is seriously inconvenient.

426
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,924
And there's no going back now.

427
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,926
It can't be helped.

428
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,971
Let's just hope those mushrooms
are growing ahead.

429
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,979
This is a genuine dwarf relic.

430
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,774
Do those mushrooms grow around here too?

431
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,484
It's really hot.

432
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,613
Maybe we should start cooking.

433
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:55,744
Now I get why Senshi
always starts cooking out of the blue.

434
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,456
This body gets really hungry.

435
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:04,252
I've never seen Namari
randomly start preparing food though.

436
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:08,298
Cooking is perfect for self-reflection.

437
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:12,761
<i>Knead together flour, water,
salt, and egg thoroughly,</i>

438
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,179
<i>then let it rest.</i>

439
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:19,142
<i>Meanwhile, combine chopped onions
and other vegetables with minced meat,</i>

440
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,894
<i>and mix well.</i>

441
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,396
<i>Shape the rested dough into a long stick.</i>

442
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,523
<i>Cut it into equal pieces,</i>

443
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:27,150
<i>and roll each piece into thin sheets.</i>

444
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,528
<i>Place the filling onto
the rolled-out dough then wrap it up.</i>

445
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,030
<i>Keep wrapping.</i>

446
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:43,750
It's strange.

447
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:48,129
Working in silence
is helping me calm down.

448
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:50,006
Aren't we making too much?

449
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,424
That turned out really nicely.

450
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,554
It's done.

451
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,266
BOILED HIPPOGRIFF DUMPLINGS

452
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,144
The shape is familiar,
but the smell is totally different.

453
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,437
It's kind of odd.

454
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,523
No potato or cheese in them, huh?

455
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,025
Back in my hometown, we usually fry them.

456
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,027
-Let's dig in.
-Let's dig in.

457
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:17,117
Careful not to burn yourself.

458
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,159
Say that first!

459
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,036
Is it just me

460
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,205
or does it taste surprisingly good?

461
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,666
Do racial differences affect taste too?

462
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,169
No, I think anyone would find this tasty.

463
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,671
It's strange, isn't it?

464
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,633
{\an8}Every region and race has its own
different ways of cooking dumplings,

465
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,760
{\an8}yet they all taste delicious.

466
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,305
R-Right!

467
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,266
It's just like us right now.

468
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:45,103
Even though some things have changed,
we're still ourselves.

469
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,688
We'll make it work.

470
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,149
That wraps things up nicely, doesn't it?

471
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,067
Only in your head.

472
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,446
Anyway, this place is odd.

473
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,114
I wonder what it was.

474
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:59,576
It's a defensive stronghold
built by dwarves, right?

475
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,244
Defensive?

476
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,039
From when the elves
and dwarves were at war.

477
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:06,541
Didn't you learn about it in school?

478
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,961
They competed to develop
more and more advanced technology,

479
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,297
which eventually led to a catastrophe.

480
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:17,135
Elves and dwarves
are afraid of history repeating itself,

481
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,055
which is why they're prickly
about technology in the dungeon.

482
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:24,309
This dungeon, in particular,
is where many cultures intersect,

483
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,354
so I imagine we're going to have
a lot of conflicts when elves step in.

484
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,564
Yeah, a-about that.

485
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:33,860
If we run into trouble with the elves,
you can do something about it, right?

486
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,445
Huh? Why me?

487
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,531
You said your mom worked at the court.

488
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,949
Don't you have connections?

489
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,451
W-Well…

490
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,869
Now, now.

491
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,205
Anyway, she's a half-foot now.

492
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,832
{\an8}If anyone's going to negotiate
with the elves, it's Senshi.

493
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,878
I'll do what I can.

494
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:57,050
Actually, we should keep searching
for a way to revert back.

495
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,718
-Agreed.
-Agreed.

496
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,845
