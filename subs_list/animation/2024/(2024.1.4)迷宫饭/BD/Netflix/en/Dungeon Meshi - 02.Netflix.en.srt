1
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,678
I'm back, Mom.

3
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,724
What's that?

4
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,226
It smells great.

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,938
That's because it's your birthday.

6
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,524
{\an8}It's all your favorite dishes.

7
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,776
Wow, really?

8
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,694
Time to eat up.

9
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,198
See? These are all your favorite…

10
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,201
ingredients from the dungeon.

11
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:03,456
What's wrong, Marcille?

12
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,126
I had a nightmare.

13
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,297
What's with this smell?

14
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,049
It's the same as in my dream.

15
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,885
Another party is making
breakfast over there.

16
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,179
They're grilling cured pork

17
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,722
and eating it.

18
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,224
I'm so jealous.

19
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,934
How truly terrible.

20
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,936
It's just so tragic.

21
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,020
100 PERSON SURVEY
ON DUNGEON MEALS

22
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,357
When it comes to meals
eaten by young adventurers nowadays,

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,277
they have bread, dried meat, and wine.

24
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,446
To build up stamina
for exploring the dungeon,

25
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,282
fat from meats is important.

26
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,033
But that alone is not enough.

27
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,203
Malnutrition is more terrifying
than monsters.

28
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,956
This may sound like a lecture,

29
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,460
but that doesn't mean
our meals are perfect either.

30
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:54,465
The young elven girl says
she's jealous of their pork,

31
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:57,385
but that's because her body wants fat.

32
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,220
I just don't want to eat monsters!

33
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,222
And so,

34
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,225
we'll hunt monsters high in fat today.

35
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,811
If we can find eggs, that's even better.

36
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,813
Eggs have all the nutrition you need.

37
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,232
We should proactively harvest them
in the dungeon.

38
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,027
{\an8}Are you thinking…

39
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,111
{\an8}Yeah, I am.

40
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,237
{\an8}What is it?

41
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,281
<i>The body of a chicken.</i>

42
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,158
<i>The tail of a snake.</i>

43
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,120
<i>A creature said to possess deadly venom
in its fangs and claws.</i>

44
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,789
<i>The Basilisk, king of snakes.</i>

45
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,626
Oh, a Basilisk.

46
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,211
Isn't that great, Marcille?

47
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,754
You'll get to eat chicken.

48
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,467
Is that chicken?
Does that really count as chicken?

49
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,552
Isn't it so cool?

50
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,764
I used to think it was cooler
when more species are mixed together.

51
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:47,352
But with only two types,
they bring out each other's strengths.

52
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,689
I even noticed the beauty of chicken,
something I used to only see as poultry.

53
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,234
It's a simple yet profound combination.

54
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:57,737
By the way, the Cockatrice
that nests deeper inside

55
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,989
is another kind of snake-tailed animal.

56
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:03,409
I've always dreamed
of comparing its taste with a Basilisk's.

57
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,370
Why would anyone want that?

58
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,581
That area is a Basilisk nest.

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,001
There it is.

60
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:14,587
Looks like they're freshly laid.

61
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:17,757
Let's snatch them up
while their mother's gone.

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,425
They're so long and narrow.

63
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,343
Hold this.

64
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,720
It's so soft.

65
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,098
A Basilisk cry.

66
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,641
Let's hurry, Senshi.

67
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,227
Wait, we got to wrap this in cloth.

68
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,898
It's the party from earlier.

69
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,720
That's the worst way to run away.

70
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,888
She's basically begging
to get her back kicked.

71
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,307
Go and save her already!

72
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,985
Spread your arms and legs out
to make your body look as big as possible

73
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,737
and make loud sounds to intimidate it.

74
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,740
That'll stop it from coming any further!

75
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,745
I want to pretend that
I'm not associated with him.

76
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,963
<i>Basilisks also have a head on their tail.</i>

77
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,216
<i>It doesn't seem to have a blind spot,
but it only has one body.</i>

78
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,303
<i>If you bait the heads with an attack
from two different directions,</i>

79
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,971
<i>the two brains will confuse the body…</i>

80
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,682
<i>for a single moment.</i>

81
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,563
How are his wounds?

82
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,482
Was he poisoned?

83
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,983
-Y-Yes.
-Laios.

84
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,652
Senshi says he has an antidote.

85
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,987
Really?

86
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,240
I want to use it in today's cooking.

87
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,992
-What?!
-What?!

88
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,244
But this guy's hanging on by a thread!

89
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,663
Instead of taking the antidote alone,

90
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,998
it's tastier when cooked.

91
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,625
{\an8}Then cook it already!

92
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,795
<i>First, cut off the tail and feet.</i>

93
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,881
<i>Blanch it a bit and pluck its feathers.</i>

94
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,260
It's chicken now.

95
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:29,680
<i>Take its innards out
and rub your spices on it.</i>

96
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,309
<i>Stuff it with veggies
and finely chopped herbs</i>

97
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,061
<i>and tie up the opening.</i>

98
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,480
<i>Put a skewer through the meat</i>

99
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,565
<i>and roast it thoroughly.</i>

100
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,067
It's done.

101
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,027
Hurry, feed it to him.

102
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,577
The meat's overflowing with juices.
It's delicious.

103
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,079
Sorry about all that.

104
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,289
You all should eat too.

105
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,457
Hold on.

106
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,334
I got to cast a healing spell first…

107
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,258
This is so good!
I could see this at a restaurant in town.

108
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,593
It tastes exactly like chicken.

109
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,221
I heard snake meat
is similar to chicken too.

110
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,809
Sorry, I'll cast my healing spell now.

111
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:15,726
Oops, wrong item.

112
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:21,858
I've never had a proper meal
like this before in a dungeon.

113
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,153
Um…

114
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:30,116
It's been three months
since we started challenging this dungeon,

115
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,619
but we keep getting wiped out
at the same place.

116
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:39,125
{\an8}How do we become strong enough
to cook monsters like you all?

117
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,043
Well, that's…

118
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,254
First, improve your diet.

119
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,256
Rethink your circadian rhythm.

120
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,258
And engage in proper exercise.

121
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,886
If you pay attention to
these three things,

122
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,638
your body will naturally get stronger.

123
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,851
<i>What incredible people.</i>

124
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,103
Let's do our best too.

125
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:07,111
Reaching the third floor today
might be impossible.

126
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,697
It's because we took
our sweet time on that roast.

127
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,367
Apparently, the Red Dragon wakes up
once a month to go hunting.

128
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,787
That was probably
when we ran into it the other day.

129
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,957
Then he's sleeping on a full stomach now.

130
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,294
I'd like to find him
before he gets an empty stomach.

131
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,213
That's why, Marcille,

132
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,423
it'd be great
if we could move things along.

133
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,679
Won't be easy at this rate.

134
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,224
I'm totally fine.

135
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,226
I can easily walk more.

136
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,310
Don't push yourself.

137
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,561
Let's rest a bit.

138
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,896
I'm not pushing myself!

139
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,022
Hey, listen.

140
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,399
If you try to act tough now,

141
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:49,153
you'll just hurt yourself
and become a burden, got it?

142
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,905
SHOCK

143
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:53,824
It might be easier
to use a different path.

144
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,077
But the Big Bat outside
will be in our way.

145
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,996
I can use magic on the Big Bats.

146
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,248
No, that's okay.

147
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,583
What about a secret passageway?

148
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,669
More traps, but fewer monsters.

149
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,420
I have trap-disarming spells…

150
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,090
It's faster if Chilchuck disarms them.

151
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,302
We're taking a path
with fewer monsters, huh?

152
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,972
We should secure some foodstuffs then.

153
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,391
Can't we get by on today's leftovers?

154
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,892
We only have meat and eggs.

155
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,727
We need vegetables.

156
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,313
There's a Mandrake colony near here.

157
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,234
Me! I know how to harvest Mandrakes!

158
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,485
Leave it to me!

159
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,656
Mandrakes are fundamental
in magic and medicine.

160
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,117
In other words, my area of expertise.

161
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,661
Everyone, listen to me this time.

162
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,664
Mandrakes scream
when you pull them from the dirt.

163
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,667
It'll make you go insane
or even cause death.

164
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,336
We would get wiped out

165
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,590
and be one step further from saving Falin.

166
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,425
To prevent that…

167
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,262
First, we need a string
and a well-trained dog.

168
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,179
A dog?

169
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:01,934
We'll tie the Mandrake to the dog's collar
and call the dog over from a distance.

170
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,770
Then, the Mandrake
will be pulled out by the dog.

171
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,856
What'll happen to the dog?

172
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:08,858
It'll die.

173
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,109
That's awful.

174
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,152
But also,

175
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:13,112
where are we going to get a dog?

176
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,782
And that method
doesn't seem very efficient.

177
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,701
But at school, we…

178
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,870
Can't we use a long string?

179
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,787
Huh?

180
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,624
Use a string so long
that we won't hear it scream.

181
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,459
Then we won't need a dog.

182
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:27,960
What?

183
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,129
I'm pretty sure we can't.

184
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,840
Maybe because it's hard to pull?

185
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,932
That scared me.

186
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,684
Was that Marcille?

187
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,897
It won't scream
if you cut its head off beforehand.

188
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,231
That's true.

189
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,067
No, that's too dangerous.

190
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,319
That's how I've eaten them for many years.

191
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:56,405
That kind of novice mentality
brings the most danger.

192
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,241
But Senshi actually has experience.

193
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:03,162
Have you ever tried
the method according to the book?

194
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:06,665
<i>No. I feel so bad for the dog.</i>

195
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,169
Either way, we don't have a dog
nor the time for this.

196
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,671
Sorry, but let's learn how Senshi does it.

197
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,091
<i>If it were that easy,</i>

198
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,676
<i>you'd think it'd be written
in the handbook.</i>

199
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,512
<i>But he's right.</i>

200
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,098
<i>It's not convincing
when I'm only reading from a book.</i>

201
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,683
<i>I shouldn't have them do
something I haven't tried myself.</i>

202
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,686
<i>Something I haven't tried?</i>

203
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,189
<i>Then I'll just have to show them.</i>

204
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,192
<i>I'll prove that my method makes sense.</i>

205
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,027
I'm sorry, Marcille!

206
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,195
I forgive you.

207
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,115
<i>But since I can't use a dog…</i>

208
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,449
<i>A monster!</i>

209
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:43,869
<i>The monsters in this area are Big Bats.</i>

210
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,955
<i>They should be asleep right now.</i>

211
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,292
<i>I wonder if this will work.</i>

212
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,461
<i>It didn't say how hard you have to pull.</i>

213
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,298
<i>Big Bat nests can be found
through their droppings.</i>

214
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,385
<i>Laios's library of knowledge
is actually coming in handy.</i>

215
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:02,972
<i>And a place
you can't hear the screams from</i>

216
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,682
<i>would be that tower.</i>

217
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,899
Focus on the target…

218
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:19,655
<i>Aire Faum Orbis!</i>

219
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:30,749
All right!

220
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,463
What's that?

221
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,630
Marcille?

222
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,347
Wait.

223
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,891
Wait…

224
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,643
<i>It really is important
to try things first.</i>

225
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,312
<i>If anything,</i>

226
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:55,024
<i>now I know why Big Bats
shouldn't be used to replace dogs.</i>

227
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:58,027
Marcille!

228
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,070
Did she die?

229
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,200
She's alive.

230
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:09,121
Using a Big Bat instead of a dog?

231
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,289
What an idiot.

232
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,710
Hey, Marcille. Can you hear me?

233
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,713
Yes, I am very well.

234
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:18,964
No, you're not.

235
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,633
She heard the scream.

236
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,051
Let's keep talking with her.

237
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,053
She'll slowly snap out of it.

238
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,555
Why did you do this?

239
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,016
I panicked when I was told
I'd be a burden,

240
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:29,934
No wait…

241
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,729
…so I wanted to stick it to you guys
and make you bow down to me.

242
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,980
What the heck?

243
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,065
Chilchuck.

244
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,945
I felt alone since I couldn't be
of help to everyone.

245
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,867
The monsters get stronger
as we go deeper into the dungeon.

246
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,620
The thing I can depend on most
is your magic,

247
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,290
so I didn't want to use it up
on such an early floor.

248
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:56,835
And everyone has strengths and weaknesses.

249
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,547
I want to rely on your strengths.

250
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,466
Someone else will cover
for your weaknesses.

251
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,719
You can depend on us more.

252
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,974
Tell her, Chilchuck.

253
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:15,729
I really think having you here with us
is a huge help.

254
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,236
Put more feeling into it.

255
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,989
When did you get back to normal?!

256
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:29,243
I didn't expect a Big Bat too.
What a surprising catch.

257
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:31,495
How about we make some omelets today?

258
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,332
Is this really a Basilisk egg?

259
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,751
It's completely different
from chicken eggs.

260
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,587
That's how snake eggs are.

261
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,672
Only its tail was a snake.

262
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,632
Its head and body were a chicken.

263
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,801
No, the tail was a chicken.

264
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,136
BODY, TAIL

265
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,890
The color on this one
is different from the rest.

266
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,266
You're right.

267
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,269
Marcille got that one
since it still has a head.

268
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:01,734
<i>Chop up the Mandrake and sauté it well.</i>

269
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,236
<i>Cover it with the egg.</i>

270
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,530
<i>Once it fluffs up…</i>

271
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,865
It's done.

272
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:10,534
MANDRAKE AND BASILISK OMELET

273
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,203
The yellow is
way darker than a chicken egg.

274
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,873
This is the Mandrake we harvested.

275
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,543
This one uses the Mandrake
harvested by the elven girl.

276
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,129
You shouldn't rub salt in someone's wound.

277
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,047
Now, now.

278
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:29,720
Marcille's isn't bitter,
and it has a mild taste.

279
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,388
Yeah, it's delicious.

280
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:35,059
The screaming must have gotten
the bitterness out.

281
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,896
It's basic cooking knowledge
that going the extra mile improves a dish.

282
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,899
It seems I only sought efficiency

283
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,151
and lost sight of what truly matters.

284
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,903
Thank you, Marcille.

285
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,822
Your knowledge and book are superb.

286
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,741
This isn't a cookbook, you know.

287
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,827
Take this small gift as my thanks.

288
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,413
You can have the most delicious part.

289
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,335
I don't want it!

290
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,673
I'm sick and tired of eating monsters!

291
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:11,261
Is the shortcut entrance around here?

292
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,262
The entrance?

293
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,181
Laios, give me your sword.

294
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,272
It's here.

295
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,821
What just happened?

296
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:32,366
Chilchuck is an expert
in detecting traps and picking locks.

297
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,744
Just so you know,
there will be traps everywhere,

298
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,913
so don't do anything unless I tell you to.

299
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,043
What I hate the most

300
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,546
are those who get in the way of my work.

301
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,015
Hold it.

302
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,782
These tiles are safe to step on.

303
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,168
What the heck was that?

304
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,879
I told you to only step
where I told you to.

305
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,631
Your foot's sticking out by so much.

306
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,508
I don't like complicated stuff.

307
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,093
Who cares what you like?

308
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,387
You've got to be more careful.

309
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,183
Some traps are connected
and affect other traps.

310
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,394
If one thing shifts,
all my calculations go out the window.

311
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,647
Just move wherever I tell you to.

312
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,534
Such firepower.

313
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,452
I see.

314
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:00,454
Traps come in many shapes and forms.

315
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,997
Move your foot already.

316
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,250
Fire traps usually come
as a set with gas or oil.

317
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,168
Oil.

318
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,295
We don't need a dwarf roast.

319
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:09,922
A roast.

320
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,840
No, wait.

321
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,842
Deep-fried food.

322
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,927
Fried.

323
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,262
<i>Kakiage</i>!

324
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,641
We'll have tempura for lunch today.

325
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,602
Where's the oil trap?

326
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,479
It's not meant for cooking.

327
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,272
Half-foot child.

328
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,608
You are no expert on oil.

329
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:31,485
I'm not a child.

330
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,780
Vegetable oil is simple
and the highest in supply.

331
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,448
Anyhow, show me the oil.

332
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,951
I'll give up
if it isn't meant for cooking.

333
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,496
Fine.

334
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,872
In exchange,

335
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,376
promise you'll follow
my orders around the traps.

336
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,130
{\an8}I won't help you
if you don't accept this condition.

337
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,173
I swear it.

338
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,925
I'll help too, if needed.

339
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,135
I won't need it.

340
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,261
{\an8}Listen.

341
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,263
{\an8}We each have our own job.

342
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,266
{\an8}Yours is cooking.
Mine is detecting traps and picking locks.

343
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,143
Marcille's is magic.

344
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,229
I don't say anything
about your cooking methods.

345
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:10,732
So, please stop interfering with my work.

346
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:15,863
The treasure vault.

347
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,783
The excessive number of traps here
must be to keep out intruders.

348
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,912
They're secured onto the ground.

349
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,582
I guess I'll try opening one.

350
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,793
Go over there.

351
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,672
He's usually the most mature one.

352
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,675
Having his companions' lives in his hands

353
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,428
is probably putting him on edge.

354
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,598
It's open.

355
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,101
I see. How do we get the oil out?

356
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,561
I don't know.

357
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,105
This is the spout.

358
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,359
Pulling this trigger will release the oil,
but I don't know how much.

359
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,570
I'll have my pot ready then.

360
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,238
Pull the trigger.

361
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,157
No way.

362
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,742
It's probably boiling oil.

363
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,118
Don't be afraid.

364
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,244
I <i>am</i> afraid.

365
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,124
Don't come crying to me later!

366
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,921
So hot!

367
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,215
I told you so.

368
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,425
Are you okay, Senshi?

369
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,801
Your finger's in it!

370
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,680
It's 180 degrees. Perfect for frying food.

371
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,642
You're the type that's okay with heat?

372
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,562
The smell and taste
tell me that it's olive oil.

373
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,563
For real?

374
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,816
They do say this area
originally produced olives.

375
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,319
It's not surprising
that it's used in traps.

376
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,197
You think so?

377
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,532
Either way, I can fry food with this.

378
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,450
Oh, right!

379
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,912
Can we use the blade
from the trap earlier to cut the meat?

380
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:50,082
No, we don't know
if it'll fall in the exact same place.

381
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,377
I'll leave it to you.

382
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,380
After all, I don't know
how to handle the traps.

383
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,215
Why should I?

384
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,511
Cooking is my job,
so you should follow my directions.

385
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,222
I believe that was our deal.

386
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,724
I never said that.

387
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,402
<i>What am I doing?</i>

388
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,822
I cut the Big Bat.

389
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:22,739
Okay.

390
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,369
Next, go heat up this oil
at the fire trap from earlier.

391
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,955
What's wrong? Hurry along.

392
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:37,713
<i>Cut off the Big Bat's thick outer layer
and chop the meat into chunks.</i>

393
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,381
<i>Lightly score the meat,</i>

394
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,883
<i>massage the seasoning in, and let it rest.</i>

395
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,262
<i>Meanwhile, let's prepare
the Mandrake</i> kakiage.

396
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,515
<i>When you peel the Mandrake skin,</i>

397
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,434
<i>it's best to pull the limbs off first.</i>

398
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:52,686
<i>You can tear them off by hand
if you unravel them.</i>

399
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,521
<i>Completely peel the body</i>

400
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,858
<i>and lightly scrape
the darker parts off the limbs.</i>

401
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,776
<i>Then, we prepare the batter.</i>

402
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,738
<i>Mix a Basilisk egg into the water</i>

403
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,698
<i>and sift flour into the mixture.</i>

404
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,616
<i>Avoid clumps while mixing it</i>

405
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,660
<i>and put the Mandrake in.</i>

406
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,954
How's the fire going?

407
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,289
How would I know?

408
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,375
I've never had to adjust
a trap's firepower before, darn it.

409
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,212
Looks just right.

410
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,137
When it looks like
it won't fall apart, flip it.

411
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,138
Got it?

412
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,306
Okay.

413
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,895
Is it ready?

414
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,939
Dang it. It was too soon.

415
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,900
Maybe the fire's too weak.

416
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:44,738
It burned.

417
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,239
How's it looking?

418
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,283
It's going horribly.
Can you take it from here?

419
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,910
The fire trap is your job.

420
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,538
I can adjust the fire,
but isn't frying part of your job?

421
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,707
It turns gooey if the fire is weak,

422
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,001
but it burns if it's too strong.

423
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,213
That must mean
it's not a trap-related issue, huh?

424
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:03,256
Looks almost ready.

425
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:06,802
The color turned out nicely.

426
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,262
It's done.

427
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,264
MANDRAKE AND BIG BAT KAKIAGE

428
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,143
I never imagined I could eat
fried food in a dungeon like this.

429
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,396
It's fried really well.

430
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,065
We had a good firepower.

431
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,068
You must aim to fry food quickly
with the right temperature.

432
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:24,611
It gets nice and crispy.

433
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,989
That's pretty hard to do
with an open fire.

434
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,617
I don't think people would do this
on an open fire.

435
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,830
I pass by here often, but who knew
such a convenient room was here?

436
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:37,833
Listen up.

437
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,335
Don't try this without me here.

438
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:41,837
You'll die for sure.

439
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,088
I know.

440
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:46,508
I can never imitate
your trap manipulation skills.

441
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,135
It's truly amazing.

442
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,179
When we go our separate ways someday,

443
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,933
it's unfortunate that I won't be able
to use that trap alone.

444
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,354
I guess I have no choice.

445
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,481
When we have some spare time,

446
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,358
I'll teach you a bit about traps.

447
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,526
Are you sure?

448
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,028
I'm kind of reluctant to do so.

449
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:12,325
{\an8}But you know,
you taught me how to cook, Senshi.

450
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,121
<i>Bread cannot replace meat.</i>

451
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,456
<i>Nor can meat replace bread.</i>

452
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,418
<i>But together, they taste even better.</i>

453
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,299
<i>Both food and people remain the same.</i>

454
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,884
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

455
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,850
