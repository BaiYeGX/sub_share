1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,429
We had such a tough time
finding those stairs up,

3
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:39,265
but as soon as we decide
to move forward, we find this.

4
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,767
It makes me feel queasy.

5
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,769
It's still wet.

6
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,815
Falin must've passed through here
not too long ago and made her way down.

7
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,734
It must've been a tight squeeze.

8
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,278
<i>The sixth floor</i>

9
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>consists of canals
made from tunnels dug by ancient dwarves.</i>

10
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,868
<i>Endlessly vast and long,</i>

11
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,205
<i>they crisscross under the city like veins.</i>

12
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:06,543
<i>Many things must have flowed
through here over the years.</i>

13
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,213
<i>Water, of course,
but also people, animals,</i>

14
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,507
<i>conspiracies, lies, and rumors.</i>

15
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,384
<i>Money and blood.</i>

16
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,469
I-It's chilly!

17
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,722
The sixth floor is
supposed to be hot and humid.

18
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,475
Maybe we're in the wrong place.

19
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,228
No, I recognize this route.

20
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,898
<i>This is definitely the floor
where the Red Dragon attacked us</i>

21
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,233
<i>and almost wiped us out.</i>

22
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,028
The walls and paths
shift around in this dungeon.

23
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,239
So it's not surprising
if the temperature changes, too.

24
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,117
Better cold than hot,

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,745
but it's hard to follow the blood trail
under all this snow and water.

26
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,624
Why don't we head back
to where we got nearly wiped out?

27
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,334
If the Cleaners
haven't gotten to them yet,

28
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,753
maybe we can retrieve
the stuff we left behind.

29
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,006
I hope Falin's okay.

30
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,842
This cold must be rough for a Red Dragon.

31
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:58,011
Oh, is that why she had feathers?

32
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,345
So what's the plan?

33
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,930
After bluffing and telling Shuro

34
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,349
that you're going
to take down the lunatic magician,

35
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,518
you do have something in mind, right?

36
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,395
About that…

37
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:10,732
<i>Falin was looking
for someone named Delgal.</i>

38
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,819
<i>It was an order given to the Red Dragon
by the lunatic magician.</i>

39
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:20,742
<i>That's also why the Dragon was
sleeplessly roaming on a different floor.</i>

40
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,036
Delgal?

41
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,621
Who was that again?

42
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,080
The name sounds familiar.

43
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:26,998
He was a king.

44
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,502
Delgal was the last king
of the Golden City

45
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,921
that fell a millennium ago.

46
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,717
<i>There are inscriptions praising him
all over this dungeon.</i>

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,052
<i>That's it!</i>

48
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,970
<i>His name is on excavated stuff as well.</i>

49
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,180
Wait a minute.

50
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,890
Didn't Delgal…

51
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:44,974
Yeah.

52
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,352
<i>When this dungeon was discovered,</i>

53
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,980
<i>he appeared on the surface,
turned to dust, and disappeared.</i>

54
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,191
So, this lunatic magician

55
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:56,945
has been commanding a Red Dragon
and reconstructing the dungeon,

56
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,197
all to find a king who vanished ages ago?

57
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,992
The lunatic magician saw the previous king
get killed before his eyes.

58
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,120
Since then, he's been afraid Delgal,
the king's son, will meet the same fate.

59
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,874
{\an8}That's why he thought
we were assassins and attacked us.

60
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,002
{\an8}Huh? Who told you that?

61
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,003
{\an8}Did you make that up?

62
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,256
No, actually,

63
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,009
<i>I bumped into the lunatic magician
in those Living Paintings.</i>

64
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,094
<i>That's how I found out.</i>

65
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,138
Remember when I mentioned
someone getting mad at me

66
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,932
after I had some food in those paintings?

67
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,475
You what?!

68
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,726
You should've said sooner!

69
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,728
I didn't recognize him at the time!

70
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:33,022
I see.

71
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:34,857
So you relived the past.

72
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:39,195
Just to confirm,
the lunatic magician is an elf, right?

73
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,614
Can elves really live for a millennium?

74
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,575
There are records of that
in the distant past,

75
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,453
but now, elves can only
live up to 500 years at most.

76
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,038
Only, huh?

77
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,749
Well, if he can control
the lives of others at will,

78
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,044
it must be a piece of cake
for him to prolong his own life.

79
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,337
Impossible!

80
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,048
Extending your own lifespan
with your own magic

81
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,051
is like eating yourself to live longer.

82
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,011
Anyway,

83
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,470
if he mistook us as the king's foe,

84
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,055
and attacked us…

85
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,558
Maybe we can clear up
his misunderstanding by talking to him.

86
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:16,482
The wind is getting stronger.

87
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,817
It's freezing!

88
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,610
<i>I can't see ahead.</i>

89
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:20,862
Can you hear me?

90
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,071
Are you guys still with me?!

91
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,573
Where are you, Laios?!

92
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,199
I can't see a thing!

93
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,577
We can't afford to get separated here!

94
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,245
Everyone, hold hands!

95
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,132
<i>We can't go on like this.</i>

96
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,218
There's a tunnel!

97
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,762
Let's take shelter!

98
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,189
Is everyone here?

99
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,190
Chil?

100
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,107
Here.

101
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,025
I'm good.

102
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,610
Marcille?

103
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,736
Uh-huh.

104
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,695
I'm here.

105
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,113
Senshi?

106
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,031
Yeah.

107
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,948
I'm fine.

108
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,408
That's a relief.

109
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,326
Huh?

110
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,787
-Marcille, lights, please?
-Hm? What was that?

111
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,255
This place feels like
it used to be a prison.

112
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,092
Anyway, for a moment I was worried that--

113
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,261
-Huh?
-Huh?

114
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,513
-No way!
-No way!

115
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:29,764
-Huh?
-Huh?

116
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,516
-What's this?
-What's this?

117
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,060
<i>There's more of us!</i>

118
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,646
Dammit! What's going on?

119
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,272
Is this illusion magic?

120
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,899
No.

121
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,279
I think these are Shapeshifters.

122
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:46,697
Shape-what?

123
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,740
Don't you know them?

124
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,660
They're monsters that pop up
back in my hometown from time to time.

125
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,122
<i>When trekking through the hills
or fields in a thick fog or blizzard,</i>

126
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,458
<i>you suddenly notice your crew
or family have multiplied.</i>

127
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,963
But they're Shapeshifters pretending
to be them and blending in.

128
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,424
Your hometown sounds
like a dangerous place.

129
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,134
Are they a kind of fairy?

130
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,802
Do they work mischief?

131
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,180
If you don't catch on, they'll devour
the original and take their place.

132
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,223
What?!

133
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,183
We have to sniff out the imposters now!

134
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,603
I must eat.

135
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,439
What a pickle.

136
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,191
Say, the Laioses over there…

137
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,444
It's obvious they're imposters.

138
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,862
True.

139
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,948
They don't seem to know
much about monsters.

140
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,909
They say Shapeshifters
can read the minds of creatures

141
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,704
and mimic the looks
of those they're close to.

142
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,372
The three versions of me over there

143
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,917
are probably how I appear
in your memories.

144
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,961
True.

145
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,337
If you look carefully,

146
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,382
they all look a little different.

147
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,844
Well then, can you start
by dealing with her?

148
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:50,761
What?

149
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,180
She's clearly an imposter.

150
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,639
True.

151
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,974
You've got it all wrong!

152
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,350
Take a closer look!

153
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,436
-I'll use magic! Black magic!
-So annoying.

154
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,979
Whose memory is that?

155
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,773
Those two are clearly imposters, too.

156
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,442
How come?

157
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,359
Huh?

158
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,444
Look closely!

159
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,988
My scarf isn't a muffler.

160
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:11,115
And Senshi's helmet is missing its notch.

161
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:14,202
Now that you mention it…

162
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,331
Those two must be
straight out of Laios' memories.

163
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,124
His memory of us is too vague.

164
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,921
Is it okay to just leave them?

165
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,882
They aren't as intelligent as humans.

166
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,010
{\an8}But if we hurt them,
they'll put up a fight.

167
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,139
{\an8}And I'd rather not fight
unknown monsters in this situation.

168
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,893
{\an8}Let's unmask these phonies peacefully
and deal with them all at once!

169
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,439
It's great that he's enthusiastic, but…

170
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,859
Can he really spot the imposters?

171
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,402
I'm not too sure.

172
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,906
<i>There are still six imposters left.</i>

173
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,451
<i>When they're all lined up,
the differences are pretty clear.</i>

174
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,205
<i>But even as we do this,
our foggy memories are getting corrected.</i>

175
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,499
<i>We need to get to the bottom of this fast.</i>

176
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,211
Each Marcille has a different hairstyle.

177
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:08,339
I can't recall how her hair was
last time I saw her.

178
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,298
-You can't?
-You can't?

179
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,093
This style is pretty unique,
so you must remember!

180
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,010
Come on!

181
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,429
It was freezing in that blizzard,
so I had it down.

182
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,182
The texture of their hair is totally off.

183
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,101
Hair is really important for a mage.

184
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,229
They're all saying stuff
that sounds just like her.

185
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:26,399
Well, they're the images
we've got of her, after all.

186
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,903
I've got it!

187
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,323
We can tell by asking for information
only the real me would know!

188
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,118
{\an8}Don't go asking them to guess
your mom's maiden name.

189
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,202
{\an8}Not that.

190
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,497
The book of magic!

191
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,208
{\an8}See?

192
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,420
{\an8}One is obviously fake.

193
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,881
But the other two seem legit.

194
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,300
What? Oh, come on!

195
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,051
Her incantation grammar is all messed up!

196
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,469
That's what I was going to say!

197
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,890
Our stuff should help us
spot the fakes a bit.

198
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,809
Senshi, show us your gear.

199
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,441
Take those three away!

200
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,615
<i>We've managed
to narrow it down to two each,</i>

201
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,992
<i>but now we're stuck again.</i>

202
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,038
<i>We've got three more imposters to find.</i>

203
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,500
All right. Let's have a meal.

204
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,377
-In this situation?
-In this situation?

205
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,297
We can't rely on appearances anymore
to spot them.

206
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,133
We'll have to judge
based on their behavior.

207
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,637
Everyone will cook
and I'll be watching closely.

208
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,389
That's how I'll spot the imposters.

209
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,394
<i>He didn't realize
he'd run into the lunatic magician</i>

210
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,146
<i>or pick up on Shuro's feelings.</i>

211
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,691
<i>He couldn't even remember
where he'd met Kabru before.</i>

212
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,153
<i>Are we really relying
on Laios' observation skills here?</i>

213
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,407
<i>-I'm worried.
-I'm worried.</i>

214
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,912
<i>I've got to figure out which
of my companions are monster imposters.</i>

215
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,331
<i>It's a chance to earn back
the trust I've lost.</i>

216
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,458
<i>I don't want to let
my friends down any further.</i>

217
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:11,087
<i>I must pick up
on those subtle differences!</i>

218
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,297
This is Laios we're talking about.

219
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:17,802
He might find the monster imposters
more appealing.

220
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,220
-That's possible.
-That's possible.

221
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,556
{\an8}<i>-We've got to do something on our own!
-We've got to do something on our own!</i>

222
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,141
{\an8}I'll be keeping an eye on things.

223
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,143
{\an8}Good luck to you all.

224
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,436
{\an8}So annoying.

225
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,604
{\an8}What are we cooking?

226
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,273
<i>We've got those things
I found on the fifth floor</i>

227
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:34,485
<i>and those provisions from Lady Maizuru.</i>

228
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:39,365
<i>We've got the perfect ingredients to make…</i>

229
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,950
And one more thing.

230
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,870
I want each of you to cook a dish
in pairs with your counterpart.

231
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,122
-What?
-What?

232
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,251
I'll be observing the differences
in behavior as you work together.

233
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,545
You can get the recipe from Senshi.

234
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,630
So, everyone,

235
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,382
are you ready?

236
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,092
Start cooking!

237
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,595
<i>First, the Chilchuck team.</i>

238
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,848
<i>Cut the meat.</i>

239
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:05,975
<i>Mix the egg and seasoning together.</i>

240
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,519
<i>Chilchuck A sat
in the middle of the corridor,</i>

241
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:12,440
<i>while Chilchuck B sat on top
of a wooden box before getting to work.</i>

242
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:13,941
What are you writing?

243
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,151
You're making this awkward!

244
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,824
This thing won't open.
Laios, give me a hand.

245
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,243
He slipped up!

246
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,245
Did you see that? B's the imposter!

247
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,164
Huh? Why do you say that?

248
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,166
Don't you get it?

249
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,835
I've got my principles
and pride, you know.

250
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,379
People help each other out, Chilchuck.

251
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,048
I think you're being too cynical.

252
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:41,135
Now that I look closer,
A has a bad look in his eye.

253
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,303
Hey.

254
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:44,555
Our Chilchuck is cuter than that.

255
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,639
Quit it!

256
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,809
L-Laios, you can tell, can't you?

257
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,061
<i>Chilchuck A…</i>

258
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:54,440
<i>He does have a mean expression.</i>

259
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,066
<i>Maybe he's the imposter.</i>

260
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,276
I'll think about it.

261
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,819
Keep cooking.

262
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,363
Dolt.

263
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,074
He insulted me in the common language.

264
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,410
<i>Next, the Marcille team.</i>

265
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,788
I know it's a little late to ask,
but what egg is this?

266
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,248
It's a Harpy's egg.

267
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,627
I thought I said at the start,

268
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,462
no humanoid monsters!

269
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,840
I've been making compromises lately,
but this is taking it too far!

270
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,426
<i>Marcille B is business as usual.</i>

271
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,011
<i>Almost to the point of being extreme.</i>

272
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,095
<i>On the other hand…</i>

273
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,306
<i>Boil the chopped up Dryad.</i>

274
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,226
What do you think, Marcille A?

275
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,977
I'm not thrilled about it,

276
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,314
but I've eaten Fish-man eggs
and even Dryads before.

277
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,982
I wouldn't make a fuss about this now.

278
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,319
I'll do anything to save Falin.

279
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:42,780
Hey!

280
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,075
I'll do anything for Falin too!

281
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,369
Your determination is a bit lacking, B.

282
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,247
I mean, it's not like
eating a Harpy will fix anything!

283
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,833
<i>Once the Dryad is soft enough
for a chopstick to go through, drain them,</i>

284
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,336
<i>and mash them up with some seasoning.</i>

285
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,673
<i>Hmm, this is tough.</i>

286
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,800
<i>They both sound like Marcille.</i>

287
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,760
<i>And finally, the Senshi team.</i>

288
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,638
Where did you find the Harpy eggs?

289
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,891
There was a nest in an old, rundown house.

290
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,102
I gathered all I could find there.

291
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,813
<i>Dice the meat into one-centimeter cubes.</i>

292
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,023
After all,

293
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,567
eggs have all the…

294
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,734
…nutrition you need.

295
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,906
<i>Sauté the ingredients with rice
over a low flame and add the seasoning.</i>

296
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,701
Rice was Shuro's favorite.

297
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:33,539
It's packed with nutrients
adventurers need.

298
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,916
We're lucky we got our hands on some.

299
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,628
<i>Unlike me, who's just eager
to try out monsters,</i>

300
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,922
<i>Senshi sees things a step deeper.</i>

301
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,009
<i>I can't match his attention
to flavor and nutrition.</i>

302
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,720
<i>All the dishes look delicious.</i>

303
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,347
<i>I can't spot the imposters
simply based on how efficient they are.</i>

304
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,561
{\an8}Um, nobody's mentioning it,
so I'm going to ask.

305
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,648
Is it just me
or is Senshi B kind of good-looking?

306
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,322
He's always been like that.

307
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,157
Senshi's always been cool.

308
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,074
-Huh?
-Huh?

309
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,911
{\an8}Is this some stereotype about dwarves?

310
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,330
{\an8}Senshi doesn't look this dopey.

311
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,624
<i>Senshi is cool.</i>

312
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,757
The dishes are almost done,
but have you made up your mind yet?

313
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,967
<i>Honestly,</i>

314
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,677
<i>I'm stumped.</i>

315
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,555
<i>They all feel like
they could be both real and fake.</i>

316
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,267
<i>Asking me to spot the illusions
conjured up in our heads</i>

317
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,478
<i>is quite unfair to start with.</i>

318
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,440
<i>Hunting down monsters disguised
as humans might be interesting,</i>

319
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:43,359
<i>but we're dealing with illusions here.</i>

320
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,446
<i>Hunting down monsters?</i>

321
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,448
It's done!

322
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,367
MEMORIES OF THE FIFTH FLOOR PILAF

323
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,284
SWEET DRYAD

324
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,494
THE WHOLE FIFTH FLOOR PICCATA

325
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,537
All right, everyone,
hear me out as we eat.

326
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,332
The ones I pegged as real are…

327
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,751
Chilchuck A!

328
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,128
<i>The mean one with a bad look in his eyes!</i>

329
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,922
Marcille B!

330
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,258
<i>The one who wouldn't want to eat
a Harpy's egg even if it was for Falin!</i>

331
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,052
And Senshi A!

332
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,261
<i>The one who looks dopey!</i>

333
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,763
So,

334
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,349
please step into the cage, imposters.

335
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,017
-Wait a minute!
-Wait a minute!

336
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,311
Why do you think he's the real deal?

337
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,730
That one's obviously the imposter!

338
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,024
What made you think that?

339
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,360
Just a hunch.

340
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,821
Anyway, I'll explain later.

341
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,156
First, let's get rid of these imposters.

342
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,783
Ju…

343
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,284
Just a hunch?

344
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,828
Get rid of?

345
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,038
As I thought, he can't be counted on.

346
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,082
We have to watch our backs…

347
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,543
On our own.

348
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,882
<i>No matter who I picked,
this was inevitable.</i>

349
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,803
<i>A shapeshifter is a broad term
for monsters that mimic other beings.</i>

350
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,556
<i>Some mimic voices, possess others,</i>

351
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:58,100
<i>or even physically change forms.</i>

352
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,394
<i>This monster falls into
one of those categories.</i>

353
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,647
<i>There's no way monsters could cook.</i>

354
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,900
<i>They're likely creating illusions,
just as Marcille suggested.</i>

355
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,071
<i>Given that they target humans and animals,
they're probably carnivores or omnivores.</i>

356
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,908
<i>They're timid and lack the strength
to attack their prey head-on.</i>

357
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,162
<i>This place is cold, dark,
and visibility is poor.</i>

358
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:22,416
<i>They're a beast that can handle the cold
and relies on smell and hearing.</i>

359
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,046
<i>Downwind is that way.</i>

360
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,132
<i>Our enemy's probably
waiting for us to tire out.</i>

361
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,844
<i>Randomly swinging my sword won't cut it.</i>

362
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,888
<i>What should I do?</i>

363
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,849
<i>Kensuke's awfully quiet too.</i>

364
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,809
<i>Maybe it'll die in this cold.</i>

365
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,480
<i>To take down a beast,
you have to fight like one.</i>

366
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,691
<i>I'll turn the tables
and make the hunter the hunted.</i>

367
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,153
<i>It's been a while,
but I'll try that thing.</i>

368
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,551
A-A dog?

369
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,594
He's good!

370
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,346
No, that's a hunting dog!

371
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,100
{\an8}<i>I've lived with dogs
for as long as I can remember.</i>

372
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,851
{\an8}<i>They taught me all sorts of things.</i>

373
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,770
<i>How to hunt,</i>

374
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,856
<i>how to take down
something stronger than you.</i>

375
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,525
<i>Now, I'll teach you!</i>

376
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:32,194
He's good!

377
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,445
He's really good!

378
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,613
Just like a dog!

379
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,615
<i>You're not the hunter,</i>

380
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,700
<i>you're the prey!</i>

381
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,413
Everyone, look! The illusions!

382
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,554
<i>It's finally showing itself.</i>

383
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,974
<i>If you're a beast, you know the rules.</i>

384
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,100
<i>In this fight,</i>

385
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:08,939
<i>the one who flinches first is the loser!</i>

386
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,068
-Laios!
-Laios!

387
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,968
Are you alive, Laios?

388
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,178
I mean, are you sane?

389
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,305
Yeah.

390
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,390
{\an8}I've got a lot of things I want to say,

391
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,601
{\an8}but why didn't you draw your sword?

392
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,020
{\an8}I got a bit too carried away
in playing the part.

393
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:53,901
None of the dishes turned out.

394
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,361
They were made
with the illusions, after all.

395
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,696
Let's make them again.

396
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,365
Anyway,

397
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,660
turns out your intuition
was spot on, Laios.

398
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,454
What tipped you off?

399
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,457
Maybe it was how you acted
when it came to monsters.

400
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,545
<i>First off, I noticed Chilchuck
was sitting on a wooden box.</i>

401
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,840
<i>Those are prime hiding spots
for Mimics and Tentacles.</i>

402
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,344
<i>The fact he seemed totally unfazed by it
didn't sit right with me.</i>

403
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,722
There was a nest in an old, rundown house.

404
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,974
I gathered all I could find there.

405
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,311
<i>Considering how much you care
about the ecosystem's balance,</i>

406
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,979
<i>that remark seemed rather thoughtless.</i>

407
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,982
I mean, it's not like
eating a Harpy will fix anything!

408
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,569
<i>Finally, the fact that Marcille
threw away the boiled water.</i>

409
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:41,198
<i>If she were being cautious of an Undine,
that action seemed reckless.</i>

410
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,117
<i>And what bothered me
was her lack of concern about it.</i>

411
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:53,502
In this situation, her carelessness
felt more genuine to me.

412
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,379
I see.

413
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,214
{\an8}I'm impressed.

414
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,508
{\an8}I've got a higher opinion
of you now, Laios.

415
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,843
{\an8}Even if your viewpoint is a bit off.

416
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:03,929
But still,

417
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,598
seeing through illusions
is practically impossible.

418
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,768
This monster banked on that one trick
to survive, after all.

419
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,895
And here I thought…

420
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,564
I've eaten Fish-man eggs
and even Dryads before.

421
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,776
<i>You caught on because of that comment.</i>

422
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:22,614
I mean, we've never had
Fish-man eggs before.

423
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:23,573
Right?

424
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,330
<i>Were they in the porridge we had that day?</i>

425
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,793
The dessert is done as well.

426
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,961
-Yay!
-Yay!

427
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,463
It's been ages
since I've had something sweet.

428
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,965
How about some tea?

429
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,552
I'm pretty sure we had tea leaves
in the provisions we got.

430
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,097
{\an8}Maybe you misplaced it.

431
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,349
{\an8}No, I'm sure I placed it right here.

432
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,314
<i>The rice…</i>

433
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,581
No one's here.

434
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,046
Marcille!

435
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,840
Drop your weapons and stay still.

436
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,801
Let's talk this out peacefully.

437
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,939
