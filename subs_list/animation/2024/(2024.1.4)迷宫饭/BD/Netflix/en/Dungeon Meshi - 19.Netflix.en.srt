1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,801
Drop your weapons now.

3
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,389
Back up and lie on your stomach.

4
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:41,059
If you twitch a muscle, I'll kill her.

5
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:45,021
{\an8}Isn't she one of Shuro's retainers?

6
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,816
{\an8}Was she following us this whole time?

7
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,567
You.

8
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,152
Undo these spells.

9
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,070
Huh?

10
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,155
The spells I'm under!

11
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,323
Get to it!

12
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,201
W-What kind of spells are you under?

13
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,828
Can't you tell by looking?

14
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,122
You wield black magic, don't you?

15
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,082
At least clue me in
on what they're cast on

16
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,334
and what kind of magic they are.

17
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,089
There are two types of spells on me.

18
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:13,216
One's on my neck.

19
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,676
And the other…

20
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,593
Huh?

21
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,390
Is all over my body.

22
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,561
{\an8}Is she a beast-man?

23
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,603
{\an8}Yeah.

24
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,730
{\an8}I've seen one a long time ago.

25
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,733
An engineered beast-man.

26
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:34,571
Apparently, they're made with black magic,
mixing human and beast souls together.

27
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,325
Fine. I'll do what I can.

28
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,245
This…

29
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,956
{\an8}looks like it's written
in the Eastern script.

30
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,583
{\an8}What kind of spells are they?

31
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,960
{\an8}Can't you tell by looking?

32
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,672
{\an8}They activate when the spellcaster
goes without touching them for a while.

33
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,508
{\an8}Is the spellcaster the one called Maizuru?

34
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,343
{\an8}How much time do you have left?

35
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,470
{\an8}What happens when you run out of time?

36
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,430
{\an8}Who knows?

37
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,140
{\an8}You might want to hurry.

38
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,767
You don't want to die with me, do you?

39
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,812
I'll let you go once you undo the spells.

40
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,482
<i>The writing is peculiar.</i>

41
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,359
<i>But I have a feeling I can undo them.</i>

42
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,485
{\an8}Hey, you brat.

43
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,403
Huh?

44
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,863
Fetch me something to eat.

45
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,830
FIELD RATION PELLET

46
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,501
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

47
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,005
If you shovel it in that fast,
you'll choke.

48
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,215
Shut up.

49
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,091
I'll prepare something hot for you.

50
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,593
Hey! Did I say you could move?

51
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,510
Whoa!

52
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:41,221
Don't underestimate--

53
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,559
{\an8}You need something to moisten your throat.

54
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,519
{\an8}I'll fix you something. That's all.

55
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,564
{\an8}If you try
to feed me monsters, I'll kill you.

56
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,399
Deal.

57
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm pretty sure I picked up some mushrooms
around where the Dryads were.

58
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:04,118
<i>They're starting to sprout
leg-like things.</i>

59
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,288
<i>Must be my imagination.</i>

60
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,333
<i>I'll set my pot on the magic circle,</i>

61
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,170
<i>melt some butter,
sauté some garlic,</i>

62
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,380
<i> and toss in the rice.</i>

63
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,383
<i>Then I'll add
the mushrooms and seasonings,</i>

64
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:20,969
<i>pour in some water,
and let it stew for a bit.</i>

65
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:32,897
<i>The fact that this is all I can make
makes me feel useless and pathetic.</i>

66
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:37,402
<i>At any rate, I can't stand the idea
of young ones going hungry.</i>

67
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,403
<i>But at least,</i>

68
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,655
I can throw in some cheese.

69
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,490
It's done.

70
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,159
RISOTTO WITH MUSHROOMS FROM A GRAVEYARD
AND CHEESE FROM ORCS

71
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,120
I'll put it here.

72
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,830
You think I'd eat that?

73
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,427
<i>This kid…</i>

74
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,179
<i>Her table manners</i>

75
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,472
<i>are terrible!</i>

76
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:08,683
Give me more!

77
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,478
{\an8}Is etiquette different
in the East or something?

78
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,773
{\an8}We never saw Shuro eating like that.

79
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,693
She simply had a poor upbringing.

80
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,737
Guess that's unfamiliar to you.

81
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,745
-Huh?
-Huh?

82
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,586
Why did you do that?

83
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,879
I hate mushrooms.

84
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,005
<i>She's picky!</i>

85
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,132
<i>This has never happened before.</i>

86
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,133
<i>Senshi…</i>

87
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,762
Your spoon.

88
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,015
Hold your spoon properly.

89
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:49,974
Hey!

90
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,976
If you come any closer, I'll kill you!

91
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,731
Hold your spoon the right way
and pick up what you threw on the floor.

92
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,483
-What'd you say?
-Hey!

93
00:05:58,566 --> 00:05:59,609
Don't!

94
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,236
It's risky to move
when I'm undoing your spell!

95
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,086
Hold your spoon like this.

96
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,796
W-Who cares how I hold it?

97
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:22,215
This way is easier for me!

98
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,008
I'm not surprised.

99
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,470
Having someone force you to hold a spoon
in an unfamiliar way must be annoying.

100
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,387
However--

101
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,722
Senshi, behind you!

102
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,018
Huh?

103
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,104
<i>I didn't feel anything.</i>

104
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,606
<i>Is this paper?</i>

105
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,733
Senshi, watch out!

106
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:48,658
That's a carving knife,
a type of knife used for cutting meat.

107
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,121
It's got a long, sharp blade
that can look pretty intimidating,

108
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,123
but it's thin and delicate.

109
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:59,502
If you wave it around like that,
what do you think is going to happen?

110
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,461
Senshi!

111
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:14,058
Just like that, you might not get
the most out of your tool,

112
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,769
leaving yourself at a disadvantage.

113
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,569
Senshi!

114
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,070
Now, Laios!

115
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,165
Are you hurt, cat girl?

116
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,668
I'm sorry for giving you a fright.

117
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:41,586
However,

118
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:46,090
there are right
and wrong ways to hold a tool.

119
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,551
I want you to think about
why that's the case.

120
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,637
{\an8}And why you shouldn't move
while a spell's being undone.

121
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,308
{\an8}If the spells had been nastier,
who knows what might've happened.

122
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,437
The food's gone cold.

123
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,105
I'll reheat it quick.

124
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,358
So?

125
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,694
Why were you coming after us?

126
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:12,658
All this time, I've been looking for a way
to break the curses on my body.

127
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,747
Turns out, these curses
were placed by black magic.

128
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,000
But I could never find anyone
who could wield black magic.

129
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,462
Until I crossed paths with that long-ears.

130
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,215
Black, I mean ancient magic
comes in all sorts.

131
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,842
My research is mainly about
drawing energy from another dimension--

132
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,760
Don't give me that!

133
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,012
I know you can do it!

134
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,640
I mean, you've done it before!

135
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,185
<i>You wielded black magic
to create that eerie half-beast creature!</i>

136
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,981
And you're all
trekking through this dungeon

137
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,691
to break the curse on that woman, right?

138
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,903
That means you know how to break curses!

139
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,405
In that case, you can free me too!

140
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,576
Get rid of this beast's soul
that's possessing me!

141
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,121
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,250
There's nothing I can do about that.

143
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,168
What?

144
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,129
<i>There's a lot we don't know
about the soul.</i>

145
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,423
<i>But it's often likened to an egg.</i>

146
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:13,135
<i>Normally, it's nestled inside
a shell we call flesh,</i>

147
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,805
<i>but once the flesh is broken,
the insides spill out</i>

148
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,390
<i>and can't be put back again.</i>

149
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,560
<i>This dungeon is under a spell</i>

150
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,396
<i>that forms a tough membrane
beneath the shell,</i>

151
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,023
<i>keeping the soul inside
even when the body is damaged.</i>

152
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:32,280
At the moment, you and Falin
have got two eggs inside one shell.

153
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,616
And once mixed together,

154
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,868
those souls can never go back
to their original form.

155
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,665
<i>I knew that, but hearing it
laid out like that hits differently.</i>

156
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,750
{\an8}What?

157
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:49,213
{\an8}If that's the case,
why press on with your journey?

158
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:55,428
One reason is
we can't just let my sister run wild.

159
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,180
She might kill the next adventurer
she crosses paths with.

160
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,099
Or get herself killed by them.

161
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,768
We want to do something
before that happens.

162
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,105
And if we return to the surface now,

163
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,357
we'll be apprehended
for dabbling in black magic.

164
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,569
Shuro will likely tell the Lord
of the Island about this incident.

165
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,738
But…

166
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:17,116
Does this mean I'm stuck like this?

167
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,076
No, listen to me!

168
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,997
I know this might sound weird,
but I'm honestly glad to have met you.

169
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,333
{\an8}I'm not sure what kind of monster
you're mixed with,

170
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,835
{\an8}but your behavior is just like a human's.

171
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,754
{\an8}And you're not out for blood either.

172
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:33,924
So, maybe even Falin,
once she's free from the dungeon's grip,

173
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,510
might be able to reclaim her true self.

174
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:40,264
Just realizing that makes me

175
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,558
so very happy right now.

176
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:44,268
Here.

177
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,105
Maybe things didn't unfold
exactly as you'd hoped,

178
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,066
but why not look at it
from a positive angle,

179
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,817
like it was fate at work?

180
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,028
The lord of the dungeon

181
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,114
is way more skilled
with ancient magic than I am.

182
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:02,787
He might have some insights
on how to separate souls.

183
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,746
Hold up.

184
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,040
Are you trying to recruit me?

185
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,502
Either way, you can't make it back
to the surface by yourself.

186
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,171
Was your name Asebi or something?

187
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,215
That's just the name I go by.

188
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,216
Then…

189
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,300
It's Izutsumi.

190
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,260
My name is Izutsumi.

191
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,428
Don't forget.

192
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,442
Laios, how much longer are you going
to keep living like this?

193
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,860
Father.

194
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,071
It's about time
you started living a proper life.

195
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,950
I didn't let you go out there
just so you could go off slaying dragons.

196
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,576
Come back to the village!

197
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,412
But Falin's still…

198
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,288
Forget about her.

199
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,292
Do you really believe someone like you
can make it out there

200
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,796
{\an8}when you ran away from both school
and the army because you couldn't fit in?

201
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,299
You don't even have the knack
for exploring the dungeon.

202
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,635
Just like back when you were gold-peeling,

203
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,721
your comrades will deceive you
and take credit for your achievements.

204
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,724
Because you're clueless
when it comes to reading people.

205
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,977
It was the same with me.

206
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,147
You believed we were close friends,

207
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,940
but I've always loathed--

208
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:13,983
Would you let that go?

209
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:15,651
We've already talked it out.

210
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,361
Wait, hang on.

211
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,864
<i>Why are my parents here?</i>

212
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,116
<i>I haven't seen them in over a decade.</i>

213
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,993
<i>And where am I?</i>

214
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,619
<i>What was I up to?</i>

215
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,204
<i>I think I was…</i>

216
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,877
<i>Lately, Marcille</i>

217
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,671
<i>seemed kind of worn out.</i>

218
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,508
Marcille, we'll take care
of keeping watch tonight.

219
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,718
You rest.

220
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,136
Huh? But why?

221
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,387
Don't worry about me.

222
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,556
Come on. Just rest.

223
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,474
Hey!

224
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,392
Ugh, what are you doing?!

225
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,228
I'm not that tired, you know.

226
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,022
I'll be up in a bit.

227
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,732
I can't be the only one to…

228
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,737
<i>But before long, her quiet breathing
turned into distressed groans.</i>

229
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,823
What's the matter, Marcille?

230
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,450
This isn't something to take lightly.

231
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,534
Is it a monster?

232
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,786
Yeah, I think it's a Nightmare.

233
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,956
<i>They prey on humans in their sleep,
inflicting them with nightmares,</i>

234
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,541
<i>and feed on their emotions.</i>

235
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,128
If this goes on,
Marcille will weaken and die.

236
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,339
Wake up, Marcille!

237
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,091
Don't. If you force her awake,
you'll harm her soul.

238
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:26,555
When Shuro was possessed before,
Falin entered his dreams to rescue him.

239
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,058
Let's try that.

240
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,352
You're going to enter her dream?

241
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,313
Someone needs
to help her realize she's dreaming.

242
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,900
{\an8}Use the dreamer as a pillow and…

243
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,327
<i>Right. I was trying to help Marcille.</i>

244
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,913
{\an8}I'm inside my own dream!

245
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,083
The Nightmare got an easy bite out of me.

246
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,459
It's always like this.

247
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,711
They sure know how to hit where it hurts!

248
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,340
But now that I know it's just a dream,
I've got the upper hand.

249
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:04,260
Come forth, my mightiest servant!

250
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,226
<i>Now, I need to enter Marcille's dream.</i>

251
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,354
Since she's serving
as my pillow right now,

252
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,440
I'll have to dig down.

253
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,238
This is the beauty of dreams.

254
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,073
This only works inside
your own dream, though.

255
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,788
That was a close one.

256
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,416
That fall almost jolted me awake.

257
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,753
So this is what
Marcille's dream looks like.

258
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,882
Pretty cool.

259
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,133
Is someone there?

260
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,093
What are you doing?

261
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,929
This place is dangerous.
You need to get out fast.

262
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,807
Marcille?

263
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,726
W-Who are you?

264
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,311
It's me, Laios!

265
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,813
And we're inside your dream!

266
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,816
You need to wake up and…

267
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,775
A tremor?

268
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,403
It's coming!

269
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,405
W-We need to run!

270
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:07,573
What's coming?

271
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,949
Just follow me!

272
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:13,203
<i>It swallowed Papa and Pipi.</i>

273
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:14,788
<i>Papa and Pipi?</i>

274
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,708
<i>A dream about being chased, huh?</i>

275
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,294
<i>Those are pretty common, but nasty.</i>

276
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,463
<i>I remember Falin mentioning…</i>

277
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,883
Nightmares thrive on emotional scars.

278
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,094
Stressful events and trauma.

279
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,015
They trigger those memories
and give people nightmares.

280
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:37,186
So all we have to do
is shield their scars.

281
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,270
I see.

282
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:39,688
But…

283
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,274
It's dangerous, so don't try it.

284
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,234
All right. I got it!

285
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,612
I'll take it down for you!

286
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,239
{\an8}What are you doing? It's too risky!

287
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,908
{\an8}Don't worry.

288
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,743
I might not seem like it,
but I'm actually…

289
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,382
What in the world is that?

290
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,050
How should I know?

291
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,053
<i>Is that what Marcille's afraid of?</i>

292
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,722
<i>It's quite a bit over the top,</i>

293
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,308
<i>but it does look like
it'll be tough for me to take down.</i>

294
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,646
<i>It wouldn't be a threat if she realized
this was all just a dream, though.</i>

295
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,023
We've come far enough.

296
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,901
Nowhere is safe.

297
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,445
Nobody stands a chance against it.

298
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,490
Don't worry.

299
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,450
Let's think of a way
to take it down together.

300
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,162
<i>What is Marcille afraid of?</i>

301
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,581
<i>A monster, of course.</i>

302
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,292
<i>It crawls sluggishly,</i>

303
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,962
<i>has countless tentacles
and an insatiable hunger,</i>

304
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,922
<i>and looks disgusting.</i>

305
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,841
<i>Is it some kind of insect?</i>

306
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,386
<i>But bugs that size are pretty rare.</i>

307
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,847
<i>Bugs…</i>

308
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,098
<i>That's it!</i>

309
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,725
It's a Wurm!

310
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,601
It's a Wurm from the Dragon family!

311
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,604
Its legs and eyes have degenerated,
so it's more like a giant caterpillar.

312
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,357
It's voracious
and devours anything living!

313
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,359
It's weak to fire and light!

314
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,945
Pretty classy choice!

315
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,572
Huh?

316
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,575
When did it…

317
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,869
Hold on!

318
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,747
R-Run!

319
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,499
Did that thing touch you?

320
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,084
Just a brush.

321
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,002
Show me!

322
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,631
What's this?

323
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,017
<i>Damn.</i>

324
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,769
<i>I frightened her even more!</i>

325
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,021
<i>It'll only make the Nightmare stronger.</i>

326
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,277
<i>What a potent poison.</i>

327
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,946
<i>What happens if you die
in someone else's dream?</i>

328
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,117
<i>No, it wants us
to feel anxious and scared.</i>

329
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,036
<i>I have to lift Marcille's spirits.</i>

330
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,287
Don't worry!

331
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,498
You can use magic!

332
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,000
You can take that thing down
all by yourself!

333
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,044
Magic?

334
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,343
<i>The place is getting even more unstable.</i>

335
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,178
<i>Did I say something wrong?</i>

336
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,304
When…

337
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,225
When I tried to use magic to defeat it,

338
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,394
she ended up like this.

339
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,688
She?

340
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,191
Wait, is that Falin?

341
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:30,943
<i>I get it now.</i>

342
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,070
<i>Marcille feels guilty
about Falin's transformation</i>

343
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,030
<i>due to her resurrection magic.</i>

344
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,699
<i>If she tried
to defeat that thing, it means…</i>

345
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,285
<i>Marcille is afraid of death!</i>

346
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,538
I-It's coming back!

347
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,582
{\an8}Running won't solve anything.

348
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,543
{\an8}You have to face it head-on.

349
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,585
{\an8}What?

350
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,922
Don't worry.
There's nothing for you to fear!

351
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,842
In the dungeon, even if you die,
you can come back to life.

352
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:58,345
Even Falin is still alive
thanks to your resurrection magic.

353
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,639
And you're used to seeing corpses, right?

354
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,349
What?!

355
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,106
{\an8}It's pulling me in!

356
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,357
{\an8}No!

357
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,109
{\an8}It's only pulling me!

358
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,694
Grab my hand!

359
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,365
<i>It's not poison.</i>

360
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,118
<i>I'm aging at an incredible rate.</i>

361
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:23,620
W-Wait a minute, Marcille.

362
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,913
I need to catch my breath.

363
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,499
<i>Something's not right.</i>

364
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,252
<i>Is there a creature capable of this?</i>

365
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,713
<i>Maybe it's not even a creature at all.</i>

366
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,382
So you won't come along with me either?

367
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,343
No, I can run again after a short rest.

368
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,261
You're lying!

369
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:43,849
Everyone who ran with me gave up,
and they were all swallowed by that thing.

370
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:47,352
Papa, Pipi, Falin, everyone!

371
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,689
That's why I studied a lot of magic.

372
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,026
But if that's what turned Falin into this,

373
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,278
I don't know what to do.

374
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,699
Did your father pass away young?

375
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,411
At Papa's funeral, Mama told me

376
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,040
<i>that I run faster than everyone else.</i>

377
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,461
<i>That I'd have to watch
a lot of people go away.</i>

378
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,589
By the way, is Pipi a relative of yours?

379
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,673
Pipi's a bird.

380
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:17,799
<i>I see.</i>

381
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,595
<i>Marcille isn't afraid of death.</i>

382
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:25,015
<i>She's worried that those she cares about
will pass away before her.</i>

383
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,190
Marcille, calm down!

384
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,193
If you're scared,
it'll just empower that thing.

385
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,862
But what am I supposed to do?

386
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,072
I can't do anything!

387
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,698
No, you can!

388
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,201
You're incredible, Marcille!

389
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,703
I mean, just look at all these books!

390
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,289
There was nothing like that in my dream!

391
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,459
You've been working tirelessly
all this time!

392
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,045
Don't lose heart. Have faith in yourself!

393
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,339
You've got this, Marcille!

394
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,341
No, get up!

395
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,801
We have to run!

396
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:01,969
And besides,

397
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,721
{\an8}my magic isn't fully developed!

398
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,224
<i>If I had the same book he does,</i>

399
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,519
<i>I could use magic more effectively, but…</i>

400
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,854
Then wish for it!

401
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,607
If you wish hard enough,
you can accomplish anything!

402
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,735
Don't be afraid!
You can do better next time!

403
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,362
Don't give up!

404
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,615
No!

405
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,617
No!

406
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,335
That's it, Marcille!

407
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,378
Do it!

408
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,225
That's how you use it?!

409
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,314
You're awake.

410
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,232
You were both groaning in your sleep.

411
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,358
Are you okay?

412
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,861
I don't really remember.

413
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,488
It was an exhausting dream, though.

414
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,202
She's falling back asleep!

415
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,371
No! Wake up, Marcille!

416
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,749
My dream?

417
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,625
I don't remember much.

418
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,587
But I think it was a fun one.

419
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,297
Looks like it worked.

420
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,882
Did something happen?

421
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,508
Pass me your pillow.

422
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,509
Huh?

423
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,597
What are those?

424
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,015
Nightmares.

425
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,685
They hide in people's pillows
and give them bad dreams.

426
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,563
There are so many of them.

427
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,857
They must have been
nesting in your pillow for a while.

428
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,775
No way!

429
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,651
Senshi, are these edible?

430
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,737
I've always been curious
about their flavor.

431
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,197
Yes, of course.

432
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,158
First, let's clean the gunk off.

433
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,037
If you soak them in hot water like this…

434
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,124
Nightmares, also known as Shen,

435
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,001
are actually related to Dragons.

436
00:22:58,085 --> 00:23:00,045
If you look closely,
they're a bit Dragon-like.

437
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,421
You're kidding me.

438
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,258
<i>Place the Nightmares in melted butter,</i>

439
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,636
<i>add some wine, and cover with a lid.</i>

440
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:14,184
<i>Finally, drizzle a bit
of soy sauce over them,</i>

441
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,685
and it's done.

442
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,272
What's this?

443
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,441
That's me!

444
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:25,028
The dream that the Nightmares devoured
turned into a mirage.

445
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,697
It's coming back to me.

446
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,740
Right,

447
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,826
I was running from something

448
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,494
<i>when a dog appeared.</i>

449
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,957
And we went on a treasure hunt together.

450
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,292
It was such a fun dream!

451
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,294
The dog seems a bit scruffy.

452
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,963
It looks dumb.

453
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,673
What's wrong, Laios?

454
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,844
I remember it being a silver wolf, but…

455
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,178
Never mind.

456
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,181
I'm glad if I helped in creating
a fun dream for her.

457
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,946
