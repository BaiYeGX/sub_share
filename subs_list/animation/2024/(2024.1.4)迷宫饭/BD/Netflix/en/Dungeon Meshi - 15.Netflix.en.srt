1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,841
Dammit!

3
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:32,967
What the hell?

4
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,720
This wall wasn't here on our way down!

5
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,181
Another earthquake?

6
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,974
Not an earthquake.

7
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,602
The dungeon is shifting
and changing its layout.

8
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,605
It's probably that magician's doing.

9
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,358
Maybe he's on the lookout for us.

10
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:52,654
You mean he's been making us
wander around in circles this whole time?

11
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,365
Maybe it's worth taking a little risk.

12
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,117
Give me a minute.

13
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,876
It's gone now.

14
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,714
Climbing over walls
might not be a smart move.

15
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,217
Guess we'll have to pick our way out.

16
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,514
Anyway, is it just me…

17
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,809
or is the city starting to bustle?

18
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,811
With the Red Dragon dead,

19
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,021
the lurking monsters
are starting to show themselves.

20
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,774
This level was originally
crawling with monsters.

21
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,694
We're lucky we didn't
bump into any until now.

22
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,407
Hey, are you okay?

23
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,243
<i>This isn't good.</i>

24
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,620
<i>We've been trekking without a break,</i>

25
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,747
<i>and we haven't had
a decent meal since that Dragon.</i>

26
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,500
<i>How old is Laios?</i>

27
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,628
<i>I'm not sure if he's getting up there
or still in his youth,</i>

28
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,507
<i>but Chilchuck and Marcille
are likely still growing.</i>

29
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,425
Come on.

30
00:02:55,508 --> 00:03:01,014
<i>It's downright shameful not being able
to provide them with proper meals.</i>

31
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,265
<i>I must feed them.</i>

32
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,267
<i>The youngsters must be fed.</i>

33
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,810
<i>I must feed them!</i>

34
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,355
What's that sweet smell?

35
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,065
Is it food?

36
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,568
No, it smells like flowers.

37
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,906
Where there are flowers,
there's usually water.

38
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,407
Track it down for us, Chil!

39
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,617
On it!

40
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,498
Is this place a graveyard or something?

41
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,128
Wait, someone's there.

42
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,594
Don't look!

43
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,015
W-We beg your pardon.

44
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,892
Hey, Senshi! Let go of me!

45
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,520
Get back, Senshi!

46
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,027
What's this?

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,028
Draw your weapon!

48
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,280
These creatures aren't human.

49
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,532
They're Dryad flowers!

50
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,993
Then what's this body fluid?

51
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,787
<i>It was not a liquid.</i>

52
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>Tiny particles entered the body
through the respiratory system,</i>

53
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,917
<i>sticking to the mucous membrane.</i>

54
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,672
<i>The body recognized
these particles as poison</i>

55
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,593
<i>and kicked the immune system into gear,
immediately attempting to flush them out.</i>

56
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,053
<i>This is known as…</i>

57
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,432
<i>hay fever.</i>

58
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,559
Ugh, gross!

59
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:29,727
It hurts!

60
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,772
{\an8}It's the Dryads' pollen!

61
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,525
This is bad. Don't breathe it!

62
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:41,322
This isn't good.

63
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,199
I can't stop crying.

64
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,621
Get up!

65
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,123
Pull yourself together, Senshi!

66
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,208
Laios!

67
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,335
-Kensuke…
-Dammit!

68
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,337
My eyes are acting up too…

69
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,091
Senshi, reach out your hand!

70
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,553
On three, use it to strike behind you!

71
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:04,971
One,

72
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,639
two…

73
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,558
Three!

74
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,900
Damn, my eyes are starting to itch too.

75
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,235
I can't see.

76
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,703
Run, Senshi!

77
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,620
No!

78
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,749
It is my duty to protect the youngsters!

79
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,125
Are you serious?

80
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,043
Chilchuck!

81
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,253
Be my eyes!

82
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,589
I can't. I can't see anything!

83
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,924
You have sharper senses!

84
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,635
<i>Smell?</i>

85
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,139
<i>No, the smell of pollen
is too overpowering.</i>

86
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:49,557
<i>Hearing?</i>

87
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,769
<i>Senshi's sneezing too loud.</i>

88
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,022
<i>I can't rely on my sight,
smell, or hearing.</i>

89
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,983
<i>The wind!</i>

90
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,321
{\an8}It avoided your sneeze
and retreated diagonally to the right.

91
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,364
Senshi, swing up now!

92
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,832
Kensuke…

93
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,212
<i>My staff is completely broken in half.</i>

94
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:22,965
<i>I've got to mend it and infuse it
with magic quickly before it withers away.</i>

95
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,761
<i>It took me years to nurture it
to its current state…</i>

96
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,725
I-It's safe in there.

97
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,851
Don't lie!

98
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,480
You fought against Dryad flowers?

99
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,565
That must've been tough.

100
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,734
I didn't think they were flower monsters.

101
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,987
I totally thought they were
male and female humans.

102
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,115
Dryads are unisexual flowers,

103
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:49,075
so you're right about them
being male and female.

104
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,244
Just maybe…

105
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,870
{\an8}What will you do about him?

106
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,248
{\an8}Shouldn't we stop him by force?

107
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:59,335
{\an8}But we can't afford to be picky anymore.

108
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:03,631
{\an8}At this point, does it really matter
if the flower resembles a human?

109
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,049
Marci--

110
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,511
I found some!

111
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,847
Dryad fruits!

112
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,850
How to turn back time…

113
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,769
Stop hunting for shady magic
like it's no big deal!

114
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:20,189
Your black magic jokes aren't funny!

115
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:25,278
The last Dryad I took out
didn't release any pollen.

116
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,113
{\an8}It must've been a female flower.

117
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:31,451
{\an8}Flowers before pollination
care for and protect their fruits.

118
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,745
I found some more
fruit-like things over here.

119
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,748
Those are buds.

120
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,251
They'll eventually grow
into Dryad flowers.

121
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,754
These seem easier
to eat than those fruits.

122
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,798
They might be pretty tasty.

123
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,216
Let's harvest them.

124
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,013
Don't pick too many.

125
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,224
Okay.

126
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,311
There are Mandrakes here.

127
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,271
We don't have time to get a dog,

128
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:02,231
so I'll just chop its head off
if you don't mind.

129
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,568
Shut up. When are you going
to let me live that down?

130
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,406
It's a pretty decent harvest.

131
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,534
Good thing I borrowed
an axe from the orcs!

132
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:19,582
<i>Put the chopped ingredients
into a pot with water and let it stew.</i>

133
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,835
<i>When the ingredients are soft,
remove from heat</i>

134
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,087
<i>and mash them inside the pot.</i>

135
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:30,343
<i>Once they turn into a paste,
add more water and seasoning.</i>

136
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,142
Smells delightful.

137
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,352
I have an idea.

138
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:43,439
<i>Sauté them lightly with butter
and throw in some mushrooms.</i>

139
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,360
<i>Pour melted cheese on top,</i>

140
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,611
<i>and it's done!</i>

141
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,364
JACK-O'-LANTERN POTAGE AND
SAUTÉED DRYAD BUDS WITH CHEESE

142
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,658
Did you have to put the soup in that?

143
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,869
I thought it might aid
in restoring your magic a little.

144
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,248
Don't think you can excuse it
just because you meant well.

145
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,083
I'll try it, though.

146
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,460
<i>It's sweet!</i>

147
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,212
<i>It has a light floral fragrance.</i>

148
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,464
<i>It's rich and creamy,
but melts in your mouth.</i>

149
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,424
<i>I love this.</i>

150
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,094
What an appalling sight.

151
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,309
The sourness of the cheese
pairs nicely with this.

152
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,979
I like the bitter tang the buds have.

153
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,275
Anyway, how do we
even get out of this dungeon?

154
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,527
What if we never find our way out?

155
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:33,114
{\an8}If all the routes
to the surface are blocked,

156
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,992
{\an8}it would disrupt the flow of magic,
so that's unlikely.

157
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,619
There has to be a way out somewhere.

158
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,832
Are there any patterns
to the shifts in the dungeon?

159
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,166
There must be!

160
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,669
Let's note down the timings
and locations of the rumblings.

161
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,713
I'm starting to feel hopeful.

162
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:52,008
A full stomach does wonders
for optimism, doesn't it?

163
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,723
I'm starting to feel warmer.

164
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:01,058
I think some of my magic is returning.

165
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,395
Laios and Senshi,
I need to heal your injuries.

166
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:06,188
You shouldn't overexert yourself.

167
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,398
I won't.

168
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,860
Laios, you'll be the one doing the work.

169
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,196
I'll teach you some magic.

170
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,451
I can't protect all of you
from the lunatic magician by myself.

171
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,288
If you can use healing and defense magic,
it would help a lot.

172
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,333
Falin has taught you the basics, right?

173
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:26,834
Sort of.

174
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,587
She specializes in the gnome magic system,

175
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,840
{\an8}which is a bit different
from the one I use.

176
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,885
But the fundamentals are similar,
so you'll catch on.

177
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,220
{\an8}I'll drum it into you in no time.

178
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,975
We need to become stronger.

179
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:48,522
Those two are too optimistic.

180
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,901
When you're young, that's just right.

181
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,072
Would you stop treating me like a child?

182
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,490
It's embarrassing!

183
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,743
{\an8}Why did you cover my eyes
in front of the monsters anyway?

184
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,411
It helped in hindsight, but still!

185
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,998
Well, Chilchuck…

186
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:09,585
You mentioned your father had passed away.

187
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,921
What about it?

188
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:12,880
I see.

189
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:17,051
This seems like a good opportunity,
so I'll teach you something.

190
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,804
Take a seat.

191
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,766
You're probably getting to that age
where you're starting to get curious,

192
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,186
but it's important
to have the correct information.

193
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,021
What's this about?

194
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,731
You see, humans

195
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,650
also have stamens and pistils.

196
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,028
That's not it! Again!

197
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,780
Pay attention!

198
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,326
<i>And so, they passed the night away.</i>

199
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,247
Come on. Hurry.

200
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,629
Not like that!

201
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,425
I didn't want to touch you in a weird way.

202
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,510
Don't let stuff like that bother you!

203
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,220
{\an8}Give me your left hand.

204
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,891
See? Just like this.

205
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,979
Feeling embarrassed won't help you
improve your magic skills.

206
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,772
Now focus!

207
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:16,193
Be mindful of the magic
coursing through your body,

208
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,820
like blood through your veins.

209
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,281
Let it flow through
the palms of your hands,

210
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,493
from the top of your head
to the tips of my toes.

211
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:28,372
Sync your breathing,
temperature, and pulse with mine.

212
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,418
Once you're ready, repeat after me.

213
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,545
{\an8}<i>-Sperae…
-Sperae…</i>

214
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,547
{\an8}<i>-Yeptum…
-Yeptum…</i>

215
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,674
{\an8}<i>-Rufermus…
-Rufermus…</i>

216
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,134
{\an8}<i>-Vilal…
-Vilal…</i>

217
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,386
<i>-Eurekant…
-Eurekant…</i>

218
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,388
<i>-Oonzu…
-Oonzu…</i>

219
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,140
That's itchy!

220
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,602
It's itching like crazy!

221
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,853
A-Are you okay?

222
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,522
My scab came off.

223
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,941
It worked!

224
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,109
You did it, Laios!

225
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,319
{\an8}Really?

226
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,196
{\an8}You're bleeding, though.

227
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,448
This is normal for your first try.

228
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,575
But you're a fast learner.

229
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,036
Maybe you really do
come from a talented line!

230
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,706
The way you explained things
made it easy to understand.

231
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,458
Thanks.

232
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,961
Well then, before you forget this feeling,

233
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:17,379
let's try healing Senshi.

234
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,675
I'll be watching,
so repeat what you did just now.

235
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:25,721
<i>Now, it's a temporary fix,</i>

236
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,598
<i>but I'll use Dryad twigs
to repair my staff.</i>

237
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,016
<i>I hope it attaches.</i>

238
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,523
-That felt weird.
-S-Sorry!

239
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:37,608
Like I said,
don't let stuff like that bother you!

240
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,610
Don't be embarrassed.

241
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,987
Feeling shy
is the biggest obstacle to progress!

242
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,449
Actually, you shouldn't
underestimate things like that.

243
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,870
Healers interact a lot with people,
which can cause difficulties.

244
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,499
The main reason parties break up
is often due to relationship issues.

245
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,877
Falling in and out of love,
envy, jealousy,

246
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,379
grudges and hatred.

247
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,047
They can be a real hassle.

248
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,801
Are you talking about Falin and Shuro?

249
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,844
I'm just speaking from my own experiences.

250
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:10,266
A leader needs the ability
to unite people more than combat skills.

251
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,894
To be honest, I want Laios
to focus on developing his social skills

252
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,146
and his ability to read people
more than magic.

253
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,067
If he had done so, he wouldn't have
unknowingly ended up

254
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,610
being an accomplice in black magic.

255
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:26,115
Well, Chilchuck, why don't you
learn a bit about magic yourself?

256
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,992
Maybe your ignorance is making you afraid.

257
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,994
Well, sorry about that!

258
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,747
Many of my kin got kidnapped by elves
and never came back,

259
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,792
just because they were involved
with some black magic artifact.

260
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,420
That's why I never got the chance
to learn more about magic.

261
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,088
So forgive me if I'm ignorant.

262
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,800
To sum up the ancient magic I'm studying,

263
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:49,179
it draws energy from another dimension
where infinity exists.

264
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:52,725
<i>How do you turn a cup of water into vapor?</i>

265
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,518
<i>By bringing it to a boil.</i>

266
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,939
<i>Well then, how do you
vaporize an entire lake?</i>

267
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,774
The theory is the same,

268
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,818
but actually doing it is a bit tricky.

269
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,573
<i>This magic would require
an enormous amount of power and time.</i>

270
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,325
<i>So, you reinforce it
with coordinate magic.</i>

271
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:13,120
This dungeon is connected
to the other dimension at multiple points.

272
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:17,541
It's through this power that monsters
are summoned and this dungeon is formed.

273
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,671
{\an8}Earlier, Falin no longer
had the strength to revive herself.

274
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,592
<i>So I rewrote a section of the dungeon</i>

275
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:30,095
<i>to make her body a part of the dungeon.</i>

276
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:32,348
Only for a brief moment, of course.

277
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,226
Another rumbling.

278
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,227
It's close.

279
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,980
Look over there!

280
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,315
The wall is crumbling.

281
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,234
Where are the bricks going?

282
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,028
How about we take a closer look?

283
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,114
Huh?

284
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,659
What's wrong?

285
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,619
I-I suddenly feel dizzy.

286
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:59,375
You might be experiencing mana sickness
because you used magic for the first time.

287
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,877
It should pass soon.

288
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,003
We're leaving you behind.

289
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:04,463
Stay put, okay?

290
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:09,134
<i>Whether my eyes are shut or open,
all I see are lurid colors.</i>

291
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,470
<i>Help.</i>

292
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,222
<i>Let me die.</i>

293
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,890
<i>The magician…</i>

294
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:18,310
<i>Am I hallucinating? Am I hearing things?</i>

295
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,605
<i>Please, let me die.</i>

296
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,858
<i>Mana sickness sucks.</i>

297
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,364
The path is shifting.

298
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,994
It feels like we're starting to grasp
a pattern, but then again, not quite.

299
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,998
We'll need to observe for a little longer.

300
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,834
It's frustrating that we can't
make much progress, but…

301
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,587
The platform is rising!

302
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,880
Get off!

303
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,382
Ow!

304
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,009
{\an8}That was close.

305
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,636
We almost lost our way back.

306
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,475
<i>Carrier of a cruel, petrifying venom,</i>

307
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,810
<i>the Cockatrice.</i>

308
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,983
It's like a Basilisk!

309
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,235
But a Cockatrice is much worse!

310
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,570
Never let it bite you!

311
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:10,988
You'll be turned to stone!

312
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,157
There's a door on the left!

313
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,700
Let's get in there!

314
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,589
What's our plan now?

315
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,424
This door won't hold for very long.

316
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,593
Can we sneak out through the back?

317
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:36,055
If this thing is anything like a Basilisk,

318
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,016
it should sense us by our body heat.

319
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,727
It will be tricky to give it the slip.

320
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,355
But that's the ability of the serpent.

321
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,150
The rooster head
should rely on its vision.

322
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:53,238
Marcille, do you remember how
Laios took down the Basilisk last time?

323
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,411
<i>Don't let it frighten you!</i>

324
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,456
<i>Intimidate the Cockatrice
with all your heart and soul!</i>

325
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,542
<i>Easier said than done.</i>

326
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:10,047
<i>Make yourself look big
and shout at the top of your lungs!</i>

327
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,425
<i>Sure, I might be the tallest of the three,</i>

328
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,303
<i>but that Cockatrice
is twice as big as the Basilisk.</i>

329
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,681
<i>And I'm not confident
about shouting either.</i>

330
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,518
<i>Wait, how did Laios shout again?</i>

331
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,562
<i>Was it like a yell?</i>

332
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,314
<i>Or more like a roar?</i>

333
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,238
<i>Never mind. If I can frighten it,
that's all that matters!</i>

334
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,120
<i>The end.</i>

335
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,579
<i>This won't work.</i>

336
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,665
<i>I just know I'll fail!</i>

337
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,542
<i>There's no way I can do what Laios did.</i>

338
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,585
<i>So what do I do?</i>

339
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,631
<i>I'll have to do it</i>

340
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:54,800
<i>my own way!</i>

341
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:01,223
<i>The most brilliant female student
in the school's history,</i>

342
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:02,558
<i>Marcille!</i>

343
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:06,895
What was that explosion just now?

344
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,689
It's Marcille! Let's go!

345
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,613
Too shallow.

346
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,617
<i>Oh no. I drew too much
attention to myself.</i>

347
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,786
<i>Now both heads are focused on me.</i>

348
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,122
<i>I don't have time
to finish an incantation.</i>

349
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,135
Marcille! Did it bite you?

350
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,928
I'm okay.

351
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,849
It bit you, you idiot!

352
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,517
For crying out loud!

353
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,020
What? You got bitten by a Cockatrice?

354
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,229
This is bad.

355
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,107
Do you know what to do
when you're bitten by a Cockatrice?

356
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,151
There's a procedure for that?

357
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,986
First, take off your pants.

358
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,948
Sit with your legs tightly closed.

359
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,161
Keep your arms to your sides
and cover your ears with your hands.

360
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,537
Close your mouth too.

361
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:09,791
Perfect.

362
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,085
Now you're all set
to turn into stone at any moment.

363
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,796
I thought the procedure
was supposed to prevent that!

364
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,263
She got petrified
in an awfully precarious position.

365
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,348
Something might break.

366
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,434
Her center of gravity is off,
so she might topple any second.

367
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,144
This is bad.

368
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,606
Being turned to stone
is the last thing a human could want.

369
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,441
What are we going to do?

370
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,943
Is there a way to reverse it?

371
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,445
There are a couple of ways.

372
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,697
First, we could wait
for her to heal naturally.

373
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,451
Apparently, petrification is more
of a curse than the effects of a poison.

374
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,162
Elves have strong resistance to spells,

375
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,289
so she should recover faster
compared to other races.

376
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:54,127
Next, we can try finding
other adventurers who might have herbs

377
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,588
or know-how to reverse petrification.

378
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:01,093
{\an8}Lastly, I could give it a shot
with a healing spell.

379
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,511
You?

380
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:05,597
Marcille taught me how
to read the book of magic.

381
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,600
There should be a spell in there
to reverse petrification.

382
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,854
Let's keep an eye out
for herbs and other adventurers,

383
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,399
while also giving
the other two options a try.

384
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,610
How long will it take for her to heal?

385
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,822
It takes anywhere from six months
to ten years for a tall-man.

386
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,324
I'll go fetch the Cockatrice.

387
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,705
<i>They got pretty discolored in one night.</i>

388
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,707
<i>I need to process them quickly.</i>

389
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,334
She looks like she's about to fall over.

390
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,629
Shouldn't we put something under her?

391
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,006
You're right.

392
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,841
I've got a good idea.

393
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:46,138
<i>Mix the julienned buds with seasoning
and place them in a pot.</i>

394
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,098
<i>Then, put Marcille on top.</i>

395
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,892
Oops, her eyelashes broke off.

396
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,729
<i>Soak the Cockatrice meat in salt water,</i>

397
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:57,357
<i>place it on Marcille's lap,
and let it rest.</i>

398
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,237
I suppose her position is more stable now.

399
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,239
She shouldn't topple over anymore.

400
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,867
She looks like some idol
from a pagan religion.

401
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,454
<i>After that, Laios
and his team worked hard.</i>

402
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,371
DAY 2

403
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,290
<i>They continued with trial and error.</i>

404
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,207
DAY 3

405
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,002
<i>And on the fourth day…</i>

406
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,003
{\an8}Found one!

407
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,005
How do you use it?

408
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,383
Why don't we try

409
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,010
placing it on her?

410
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:28,096
<i>The stone is starting
to warm with my body heat.</i>

411
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,765
<i>Let's try the spell.</i>

412
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,267
<i>Sperae Yeptum</i>

413
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,770
<i>Rufermus Vilal…</i>

414
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,857
<i>Am I pronouncing it correctly?</i>

415
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:41,860
Watch out!

416
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,659
Marcille!

417
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,786
You're soft again.

418
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,621
It worked!

419
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:53,830
Huh?

420
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:54,873
What's going on?

421
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,875
Why do I have vegetable slices on me?

422
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,335
And what's with this pot?

423
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,170
Let's see.

424
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,756
This worked too.

425
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,091
-Hurray!
-Will someone explain?

426
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,843
<i>Boil the brined meat</i>

427
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,595
<i>and cut it into thin slices.</i>

428
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,848
<i>Dress it with fermented buds,</i>

429
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,475
<i>and it's done.</i>

430
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,852
EISBEIN-STYLE COCKATRICE
AND SAUERKRAUT-STYLE DRYAD BUDS

431
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,604
It's been that long?

432
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,065
In the end, what did the trick?

433
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,068
We tried so many things,
who can say for sure?

434
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,320
I hope it was my spell.

435
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:28,615
Nah, I say it was
the fresh herbs that did it.

436
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:33,620
Maybe the cooked Cockatrice meat
neutralized the curse.

437
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:37,165
{\an8}<i>We need to get back
to the surface as soon as possible,</i>

438
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,667
{\an8}<i>and yet I delayed us all.</i>

439
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,377
{\an8}You guys, I'm sor--

440
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,088
{\an8}<i>No, that's not it.</i>

441
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,758
{\an8}<i>There's something else
I should say in this situation.</i>

442
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,302
{\an8}<i>Yes, first, I should say…</i>

443
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,181
You shouldn't use someone
as a fermentation weight.

444
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,309
<i>Be that as it may, dungeon food.</i>

445
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:58,603
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>

446
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,862
