1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,512
We're back!

3
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,265
-Nothing beats the air above ground.
-Here you go.

4
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,518
Is it morning or evening?

5
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,894
Don't touch the window yet!

6
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,021
You'll disrupt the teleportation spell!

7
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:45,939
Kabru.

8
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,691
Tomorrow, I'm going to report
to the Lord of the Island.

9
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,402
I want you to back up my story.

10
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,197
Are you going
to share everything with him?

11
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,408
There's no need to bring up
Laios and his party specifically.

12
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:02,288
I just don't want Falin
to take any more lives.

13
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,414
All right.

14
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,792
You should get some good rest today.

15
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,002
Check it out, Kuro!

16
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,170
Huge ship.

17
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,215
I wonder if it's packed with rich folks!

18
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,304
This is bad.

19
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,515
Toshiro,

20
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:23,017
I think we should head out right now.

21
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,435
What's this white ship?

22
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,063
It's a ship of the western elves.

23
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,315
See that figurehead of a little bird?

24
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,651
They're known as the Canaries.

25
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,573
<i>They show up when a dungeon's
danger level rises past a certain point.</i>

26
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,286
<i>Their mission is to investigate dungeons
and take control of them.</i>

27
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:45,623
Word had it they were applying pressure
on the Lord of the Island,

28
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,959
but it looks like they're
really cracking down now.

29
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,836
Is that even permitted?

30
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,921
This land belongs to tall-men.

31
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,134
Short-lived races are like infants
to elves and dwarves.

32
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:00,096
And the Lord of the Island
isn't skilled at negotiations.

33
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:01,389
<i>We should hurry.</i>

34
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,436
Hey!

35
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,771
It's you, Shuro.

36
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,064
Namari.

37
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,816
Where's Falin?

38
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,488
Laios and the others
haven't given up yet, though.

39
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,240
I see.

40
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,161
{\an8}Were they eating "you know what"?

41
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,287
{\an8}They were.

42
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,498
We've come to see the Lord of the Island.

43
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,751
That's not possible.

44
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,754
Some important folks showed up suddenly,
and he's been in there since.

45
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:35,256
It's been hours now.

46
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,258
We're too late.

47
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,052
Let's go inside.

48
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,261
We can't do that.

49
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,389
If the elves get hold of the dungeon,
it's going to be over.

50
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,685
{\an8}My hometown also thrived
because of a dungeon.

51
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,272
<i>But one day, monsters flooded out,</i>

52
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,942
<i>the elves came, and many lost their lives.</i>

53
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,946
<i>Why did my family have to die?</i>

54
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,325
<i>My mother worked so hard
to raise me on her own.</i>

55
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,953
<i>She didn't deserve to die like that.</i>

56
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:09,332
I don't want to see that happen again.

57
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,585
{\an8}The existing system,
where only certain races wield power,

58
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,379
{\an8}is detrimental to everyone involved.

59
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,178
Excuse us.

60
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,098
We've come to make a report
to the Lord of the Island.

61
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,476
What is it?

62
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,728
As you can see,
we're in the middle of a discussion.

63
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,230
We ask you to leave.

64
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,483
It concerns
the current condition of the dungeon.

65
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,026
Please hear us out.

66
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,281
<i>I mustn't be intimidated.</i>

67
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,033
Keep it brief.

68
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,911
Just earlier, while exploring the dungeon,

69
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,415
<i>we encountered a human
who had been transformed into a monster.</i>

70
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,166
{\an8}-What?
-What?

71
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,210
Dammit. A Chimera.

72
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,920
It's advancing quicker than we thought.

73
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,839
See? What did I tell you?

74
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,591
I knew we couldn't afford
to leisurely wait for a response!

75
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,260
Order them to come ashore at once!

76
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,469
You have no right to do that!

77
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,847
Calm down, old man.

78
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,726
Borders become inconsequential
when lives are at stake.

79
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,146
You have no right to treat me as elderly!

80
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,732
Tansu, why don't we let them
have their way?

81
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,816
What?

82
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,609
I'm impressed, my lord.

83
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,236
You are flexible and wise.

84
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,238
Please place your seal here.

85
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,449
You mustn't! You can't!

86
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:27,577
That just made matters worse.

87
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,245
<i>If only…</i>

88
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,623
<i>I had the ability
to take control of the dungeon,</i>

89
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,125
<i>there wouldn't be an issue.</i>

90
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,793
<i>But it was beyond me.</i>

91
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:40,923
<i>So I began searching for ways
to assist other capable adventurers.</i>

92
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:46,095
<i>But the majority of them turned out
to be self-centered and insignificant.</i>

93
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:50,850
<i>Just as I resolved to tackle
the dungeon myself,</i>

94
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,728
<i>I heard rumors about the Touden siblings.</i>

95
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,855
He must come from good stock.

96
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,108
He's got good instincts,
but he's just too selfless.

97
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,902
Anyway, he's weird.

98
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,572
<i>The more I looked into him,
the stranger he seemed.</i>

99
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,326
<i>He's not particularly strong, yet he
somehow made it to the lower levels.</i>

100
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,662
<i>Giving money to folks with nothing
but bad gossip surrounding them.</i>

101
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,122
<i>His mysterious background.</i>

102
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,208
<i>His odd companions.</i>

103
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,836
<i>But for some reason,
I had a hunch that this man</i>

104
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,256
<i>might play a big part
in the fate of this island.</i>

105
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,927
<i>The question is
whether it'll be for better or worse.</i>

106
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,555
<i>I've been eager to talk with him in person
and form my own opinion.</i>

107
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,266
<i>And after finally conversing with him,
I've become convinced.</i>

108
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,603
<i>All he cares about are monsters.</i>

109
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,606
<i>He's incapable of considering
the future of the island.</i>

110
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:41,400
<i>It shouldn't be left in his hands,
but I'm sure of one thing.</i>

111
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,069
<i>Currently,</i>

112
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:46,989
<i>among all the tall-men, he's the closest
to reaching the heart of the dungeon.</i>

113
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,952
<i>This could be his one and only chance.</i>

114
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:53,746
<i>Therefore,
I can't let the elves interfere.</i>

115
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,541
{\an8}<i>Dealing with him must wait until later.</i>

116
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,626
I've had enough of this.

117
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,378
Do as you please.

118
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,379
My lord!

119
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,964
Give the order to come ashore.

120
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,173
Please wait!

121
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,635
The dungeon's layout, environment,
and the types of monsters within

122
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,762
are undergoing drastic changes.

123
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,139
It's extremely unstable.

124
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,266
We're well aware of that.

125
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,810
It's a natural occurrence
during a dungeon's expansion.

126
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,895
We must halt it without any delay.

127
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,064
It's similar to a person's growth spurt,

128
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,900
a phase that requires
the most nourishment.

129
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,152
What're you talking about?

130
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:26,279
Fifteen years ago, my hometown

131
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,948
was destroyed because of a dungeon.

132
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,784
It was a town called Utaya.

133
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,453
Fifteen years ago?

134
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,412
That means…

135
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,540
Are you the kid
who survived that incident?

136
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,461
I heard that the vice commander
at the time took you in.

137
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,378
That's right.

138
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,464
I was in her care for a few years.

139
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,381
Hmm.

140
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,925
She must've doted on you,
and yet you became an adventurer.

141
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,554
I dreamt of enlisting,
but the racial barrier stood in my way.

142
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,015
But I wanted to do what I could

143
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,350
to prevent another tragedy
like the one in my hometown.

144
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,852
How admirable.

145
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,187
Are you making enough to eat?

146
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,856
You should visit her and show her
how you're doing once in a while.

147
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,191
And?

148
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,776
You mentioned nourishment.

149
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,944
What about it?

150
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,196
Continue.

151
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,199
{\an8}Thanks to your efforts,

152
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,951
{\an8}the dungeon in Utaya collapsed swiftly.

153
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:18,206
<i>But many soldiers
and citizens lost their lives.</i>

154
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:20,333
<i>Because the dead turned into monsters</i>

155
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,710
<i>and ate people alive.</i>

156
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:26,214
<i>I heard there were many soldiers
who were ambushed from behind.</i>

157
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:29,592
Even if you charge in with sheer numbers,
it will be like Utaya all over again.

158
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,220
I propose sealing the dungeon.

159
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,348
{\an8}We must not feed it.

160
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:40,144
Damaging the dungeon through combat
can't be what you want either.

161
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,104
What about the people still inside?

162
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,273
Most of them are on the first level.

163
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,692
We'll evacuate them gradually.

164
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,695
Everyone has some connections.

165
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,698
I know people I can reach out to
for assistance.

166
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,825
Please let me handle this!

167
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,872
<i>This guy</i>

168
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,750
<i>ate monsters with a background like that?</i>

169
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,713
Hey, begin preparations.

170
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,508
-For an investigation.
-Huh?

171
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,136
{\an8}You're up to something, aren't you?

172
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,973
Since you insist,
let's see what you can do.

173
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,643
If anything happens,
we'll send in troops at once.

174
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,395
Am I clear?

175
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,063
Yes.

176
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,490
Is it like scrambled eggs?

177
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,491
Huh?

178
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,452
You once likened souls to eggs.

179
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,122
If two souls are blended together,

180
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,625
what kind of egg would that be like?

181
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,085
For example,

182
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:50,798
a scrambled egg is entirely different
from a sunny side up.

183
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,799
Listen.

184
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,551
I didn't use an egg to illustrate a soul

185
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,137
so you could jump on my words
and play with them.

186
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,638
Is that so?

187
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,517
I thought it was quite a clever metaphor.

188
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,605
Nothing has as many properties as an egg.

189
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,441
Consider, for example,
its coagulation temperature.

190
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,027
The whites and yolks coagulate
at different temperatures.

191
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,988
It can be whipped, used as a moisturizer,
and serve as an adhesive.

192
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:16,157
What's interesting
is its emulsifying ability.

193
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,827
Despite water and oil
being natural opposites,

194
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,580
eggs can blend them together nicely,
under the right conditions.

195
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,873
Like so.

196
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,000
Well…

197
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,377
True, why did I liken souls to eggs?

198
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,714
Laios, fetch me the bread over there.

199
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,559
It's done!

200
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,270
SOUL EGGS BENEDICT

201
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,774
How do you eat this?

202
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,276
Use a fork and knife.

203
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,237
Scoop up the yolk and sauce
with the bread.

204
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,037
Naturally, it's delicious.

205
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,540
Izutsumi,

206
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,543
would you stop glancing around at nothing?

207
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,920
Or do you actually see something?

208
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,296
Not really.

209
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,049
I just thought I sensed a presence.

210
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:16,926
What?

211
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,678
{\an8}Maybe what I'm seeing
isn't a hallucination!

212
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:21,680
Huh?

213
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,684
Well, the other day
when I had mana sickness,

214
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,479
I mentioned seeing
and hearing things, right?

215
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,314
It's been going on this whole time.

216
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,608
This whole time? Why didn't you tell us?

217
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:35,611
Because he'd be quick to think
there's something wrong with my head.

218
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,029
Am I wrong, though?

219
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,698
What are the hallucinations like?

220
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,704
I hear someone talking to me constantly.

221
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,707
<i>At first, I couldn't make out the words.</i>

222
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,086
<i>But over time, both its voice
and form have become clearer.</i>

223
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,464
<i>I was scared, so I've been
trying to ignore it, but…</i>

224
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,551
So you could hear me all along.

225
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,303
What did it say just now?

226
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:04,598
It's upset because I've been ignoring him.

227
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,725
Is it safe to talk with it?

228
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:08,269
Does it feel evil?

229
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,938
Yeah. If anything, I'd say so.

230
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,274
Hey.

231
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,942
How can I help you?

232
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,529
What's it saying?

233
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,866
It's upset I'm treating it like a fiend.

234
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,160
Also…

235
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,414
it's saying, "Aren't you grateful
I saved you from the magician?"

236
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,540
Huh?

237
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,376
<i>I remember now!</i>

238
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,004
That did happen, didn't it?

239
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,505
Thank it for us.

240
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,509
It wants us to meet someone.

241
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,886
What should we do?

242
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,721
This someone better not be a Grim Reaper.

243
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,890
Well, we don't really have other options.

244
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,059
Okay! Take us to this person!

245
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,600
What?

246
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,101
This place…

247
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,103
Hey!

248
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,105
Watch out!

249
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,691
A U-Unicorn!

250
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,488
You guys,
are you from outside by any chance?

251
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:45,366
No, we were in the dungeon and…

252
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,825
This is a big deal!

253
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,952
Come with me!

254
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,128
The monsters are so tame.

255
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,465
They're under orders not to hurt us.

256
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,760
But you outsiders are different.

257
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,471
Always keep the village's things on you.

258
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,766
Izutsumi, what's the matter?

259
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,268
Is it teleportation sickness?

260
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,019
Maybe the fatigue's getting to her.

261
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,481
Is that the Golden Castle?

262
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,399
Yup.

263
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,318
We were brought here by some ghosts.

264
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,404
Are they residents here?

265
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,530
They are.

266
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,867
But you can hear all about it
from the person you're about to meet.

267
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,620
I don't really understand
why you guys were chosen either.

268
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:32,872
"Chosen"?

269
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,666
Here we are.

270
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,792
Sit tight for a bit.

271
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,298
The master's gone to worship.

272
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,677
-It's them.
-What?

273
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,887
These guys?

274
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,432
Seems you were out of luck a bit.

275
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:55,936
Make yourselves comfortable in the village
until the master comes home.

276
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,690
{\an8}It seems like everyone's dying
to look after you guys, anyway.

277
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,067
{\an8}What should we show you?

278
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,194
{\an8}There isn't much to see in this village.

279
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,864
{\an8}Are they all residents
of the Golden Castle?

280
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,616
{\an8}I don't see any elderly people around.

281
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,911
{\an8}I want to see where the monsters are kept.

282
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,206
{\an8}I'd like to check out the fields
we passed on our way here.

283
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,626
What? That's what you're interested in?

284
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,836
Sure, we can take you there.

285
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,379
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

286
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,341
I'll wait here.

287
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:28,052
We can't leave Izutsumi alone anyway.

288
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,094
I'll stay too.

289
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,138
A-A Minotaur…

290
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,848
Female?!

291
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,726
They're our milk cows.

292
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,645
Why use monsters as livestock?

293
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,562
Huh?

294
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,106
Well, regular livestock
was hard to acquire.

295
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,244
This is a fine, well-tended field.

296
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,331
Do the villagers consume all the produce?

297
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,833
Actually, there's a lot of waste.

298
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:03,253
But without fields,
there's nothing for us to do.

299
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,548
We're maintaining them to replicate
our lifestyle from above ground.

300
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,716
Oh!

301
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,137
Izutsumi, are you okay?

302
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,393
<i>At least she doesn't seem to be unwell.</i>

303
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,854
Um, could we get a moment of your time?

304
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,400
Dresses?

305
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,484
Exactly!

306
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,236
We make clothes!

307
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,488
We usually take turns dressing up,

308
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,657
but it's become monotonous
with the same members.

309
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,826
I'd be happy to help.

310
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,286
Which one should we try?

311
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,163
I think we should go with red.

312
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,289
Sorry,

313
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,376
they might seem old-fashioned to you.

314
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,294
I wouldn't say that.

315
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,301
<i>This isn't quite what I was expecting.</i>

316
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:55,681
<i>I suppose being isolated from the outside
for a millennium would alter fashion too.</i>

317
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,057
Try these next!

318
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,562
That's good!

319
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,772
I'm pretty particular about my drinks,

320
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,441
but this is pretty decent.

321
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,775
I'm honored.

322
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,986
I serve it to orcs sometimes,

323
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,447
and the latest batches
have been quite popular.

324
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,283
It's really nice.

325
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,702
Do you happen to make wine as well?

326
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,705
I've actually just begun recently.

327
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,332
But compared to the ale
that I've been brewing for 400 years,

328
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,333
it's been a bit tricky.

329
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,918
Four hundred years?

330
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,670
That's a long-standing brewery!

331
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,130
What generation are you?

332
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:31,341
I began when I was 600 years old,
so I'm the first generation.

333
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:33,343
I see.

334
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,097
They let me milk a Minotaur!

335
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,599
That's cool.

336
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,225
Keep it to yourself.

337
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,977
This is incredible!

338
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,731
They've completely succeeded
in cultivating monsters here!

339
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:49,526
Just look at that vast Dryad farm!

340
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,653
They've got four nipples, just like a cow!

341
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,156
This is making me feel sick.

342
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,743
Anyway, it was an amazing experience.

343
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,411
Milking a--

344
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,914
Speaking of which,
where are Marcille and Izutsumi?

345
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,707
How did that bring them to mind?

346
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,126
S-Sorry for the wait.

347
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:13,258
What's up with your outfits?
You're having too much fun!

348
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,760
It's not like that!

349
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,762
They wanted us to, and we couldn't say no.

350
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,474
I did choose the tamest one, you know.

351
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,391
NOT TAME

352
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,644
Marcille, you…

353
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,105
W-What?

354
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,651
Why is Izutsumi so attached to you?

355
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,152
That's your question?

356
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,029
I wonder too!

357
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,325
It's like she's regressed to infancy.

358
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,285
Hmm!

359
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,453
No!

360
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,666
There are multiple barriers
layered on top of each other here.

361
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:49,169
So maybe they're somehow interfering
with something inside Izutsumi.

362
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,505
Because she's half-monster?

363
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:52,422
Yeah.

364
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,593
I've never encountered a barrier that
suppresses aggression in monsters before.

365
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,180
If only I could decipher this.

366
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,516
{\an8}But there are too many
unfamiliar characters,

367
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,934
{\an8}I can't solve it overnight!

368
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:07,813
Everything I try to study
is censored these days!

369
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,191
But this place is really amazing.

370
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,946
If it weren't for this situation,
I'd have loved to remain here forever.

371
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:18,407
Me too.

372
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,331
Sorry for the wait.

373
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,710
Although modest,
we've prepared a meal for you.

374
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:30,919
Please follow me.

375
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,009
Welcome, everyone.

376
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,719
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

377
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,762
My name is Yaad.

378
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,725
I'm the grandson of Delgal,
whom you must be familiar with.

379
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,059
Delgal…

380
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,853
Please take a seat.

381
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,482
I'll share with you the long tale
of why I've summoned you here.

382
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,359
Serve them.

383
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,655
VEGETABLES IN SLIME ASPIC
BEEF RIB STEAK

384
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,616
BLADE FISH LOAF
POTATO AND RABBIT SOUP

385
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,868
Um, what kind of meat is this?

386
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:06,038
Right. As your group
specifically requested,

387
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,748
it's Minotaur meat.

388
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,045
Do you regularly eat monsters too?

389
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,007
Some do,
but we generally don't eat at all.

390
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,761
Partly because
our sense of taste has diminished,

391
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,181
but in the first place,
we don't experience hunger at all.

392
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:29,728
That's the curse of immortality
the lunatic magician has placed on us.

393
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,025
Why did the magician do such a thing?

394
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,485
{\an8}Who knows?

395
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,695
{\an8}By the time I was old enough
to understand things,

396
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,241
{\an8}he was no longer in a state
to hold proper conversations.

397
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,453
But don't concern yourselves about us.

398
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,622
Please, enjoy your meal.

399
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:53,543
We might not feel any hunger,
but it pleases us to watch others eat!

400
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:58,048
<i>-I can't say I don't want to eat now!
-I can't say I don't want to eat now!</i>

401
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,426
My grandfather…

402
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:07,266
<i>blamed himself for turning
the magician's focus on black magic.</i>

403
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,268
<i>And he agonized over it for a long time.</i>

404
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,522
<i>Eventually, he headed to the surface
seeking assistance.</i>

405
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,567
How is my grandfather
known on the surface?

406
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,736
As far as I've heard,

407
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,698
he emerged suddenly from
an underground graveyard near a village.

408
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,658
<i>He named himself
the king of a fallen kingdom,</i>

409
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:28,829
<i>and offered the entire realm to anyone
who could defeat the lunatic magician.</i>

410
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,706
<i>Then, he turned to dust.</i>

411
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,457
Is that so?

412
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,210
At least there's some solace in knowing

413
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,462
that he has been liberated
from his suffering.

414
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,591
Many have left the village
seeking to escape the curse.

415
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,136
But none have succeeded.

416
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,555
They've simply lost their flesh.

417
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,559
<i>Without their bodies,
they gradually lost their identities,</i>

418
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,479
<i>transformed into fiends,
and are unable to return here.</i>

419
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,024
You must've encountered some of them.

420
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,358
<i>-We have!
-We have!</i>

421
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,111
-<i>We blasted them with holy water</i>
-<i>We blasted them with holy water</i>

422
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,863
-<i>and made sorbet out of it too!</i>
-<i>and made sorbet out of it too!</i>

423
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:05,115
S-So,

424
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,492
what's the reason behind inviting us here?

425
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,785
The prophecy.

426
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,828
The prophecy?

427
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,746
That's right.

428
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:13,999
"There will come one
bearing a winged sword,

429
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:18,879
who will defeat
the lunatic magician and free us."

430
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,088
Winged?

431
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,506
Does that mean Kensuke?

432
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,009
It does have wings, but…

433
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,137
Huh? It has a lion's face on it!

434
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,513
When did that happen?

435
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,933
<i>The Winged Lion
is the guardian deity of this kingdom.</i>

436
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:36,104
<i>The lunatic magician has imprisoned it
at the depths of the dungeon.</i>

437
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:41,777
<i>But even now, through dreams,
it prophesies the future and guides us.</i>

438
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,781
<i>My grandfather also left for the surface
because of a prophecy.</i>

439
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,533
Sir Laios,

440
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,911
the prophecy continues like this.

441
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:55,916
"The bearer of the winged sword
will defeat the lunatic magician,

442
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,669
and become the new king of this kingdom."

443
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,214
You've got the wrong person!

444
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,591
He only picked up this sword by chance!

445
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,009
It wasn't chance.

446
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:10,597
The fact that it's here now
suggests it was predestined.

447
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,184
Sir Laios,

448
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,937
will you give us your word?

449
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,815
That you will defeat the lunatic magician

450
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,025
and liberate us.

451
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,319
I…

452
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,362
Um…

453
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,328
Please let me think about it.

454
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,705
Just say no.

455
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,208
Why are you giving them false hope?

456
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,460
I can't just turn them down.

457
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,920
Kensuke,

458
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,589
when did you undergo your transformation?

459
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,135
It might have happened
when the Dungeon Cleaners got to it.

460
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,430
I was so nervous

461
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:55,225
that I couldn't really taste
the food they prepared.

462
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,435
You shameless bastard!

463
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,230
How dare you make a request on our behalf!

464
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,733
In truth, it barely had any taste at all.

465
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:07,988
They mentioned they don't need to eat.

466
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,533
That's why
their cooking skills are lacking.

467
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,244
I've been thinking.

468
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:18,915
<i>They shouldn't need fields or dishes.</i>

469
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,251
<i>So why do they have them?</i>

470
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:27,257
<i>Why do they persist in cleaning
and maintaining them for a millennium?</i>

471
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,886
It must be because they depended on them

472
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:35,557
to stay sane and to keep on living.

473
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:37,809
Laios,

474
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:43,732
I remember what you said to the orc chief.

475
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,649
Huh?

476
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,652
What did I say again?

477
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:51,072
Well, you should sleep on it for a night.

478
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,410
Can I stay here too?

479
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,454
Sleep in the room they prepared for you.

480
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,164
I don't want to be alone!

481
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,208
Izutsumi is acting weird too.

482
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,626
Scoot over.

483
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,169
Sleep on the floor!

484
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,254
<i>His hands were cold.</i>

485
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,937
