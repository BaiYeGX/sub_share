1
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,634
How boring is this?

3
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:33,927
You got that right.

4
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,512
Take this, will you?

5
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:43,394
It's good!

6
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:44,896
It's good.

7
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,606
When we enter the dungeon again,

8
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,901
we won't be able
to have delicious food for a while.

9
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,736
Better savor it well, then.

10
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,739
Hey, Kabru!

11
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,492
How're you doing lately?

12
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,661
Seems like you're doing well.

13
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:02,580
Nah, we still have a long way to go.

14
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,083
Until just a while ago,
you were just fledglings.

15
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,001
But now you have an air of confidence.

16
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,838
On the other hand,
none of the other big parties…

17
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,674
are faring so well.

18
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,425
Is that so?

19
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,428
Missing persons. Falling outs.

20
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,181
Oh, and trouble over money matters.

21
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,267
To everyone's surprise,
it might be folks like you

22
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,353
who end up defeating the lunatic magician.

23
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,188
Oh, no.

24
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,690
I'm not sure about that.

25
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,692
So you say, but you just might!

26
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,948
-You gave him a polite smile.
-Huh?

27
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,409
Instead of putting on a polite smile
and being noncommittal,

28
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,369
you should have told him clearly.

29
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,455
"Of course, we'll be the ones
to defeat the magician."

30
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,835
"We won't become adventurers like you
who live from hand-to-mouth."

31
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:50,920
Rin…

32
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,135
Let's show them with action
rather than words.

33
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,640
So, we'll venture
a little deeper this time.

34
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,475
Let's make careful preparations.

35
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,987
Welcome.

36
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,199
A week's worth of food for six people
and water for two days.

37
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,452
Here you go.

38
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:30,418
Food is a trickier issue than monsters
when venturing into the lower levels.

39
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,837
Just a week's worth of food is this heavy.

40
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:36,382
I wonder how people manage
when they go underground for a month.

41
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,759
Mickbell,

42
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,762
let me tell you how.

43
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,727
They eat other adventurers
they meet in the dungeon!

44
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:55,026
{\an8}It's probably easier to hunt monsters
than attack humans.

45
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,904
I sure don't want to end up like them.

46
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:11,459
I've never been to this floor before,
but it's not that hard.

47
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,711
At this rate,
we could probably go even deeper.

48
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,923
You have a point, Rin,
but let's be careful.

49
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,801
You never know what might happen here.

50
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:23,179
I've heard that things have been strange
inside the dungeon recently.

51
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,182
Monsters are more active than usual,

52
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,810
and the dungeon's layout is shifting.

53
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,146
Something unusual is happening,
that's for sure.

54
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,065
Let's keep our guard up.

55
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,191
Hey!

56
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,194
Kabru, look what I found!

57
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,946
Open it.

58
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:42,073
It's just going to be
a waste of time again.

59
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,410
You never know. There might be
a stack of gold coins inside.

60
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,830
Like we ever discovered
anything valuable in those.

61
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:52,667
It's something a zombie was carrying
as if it were a treasure,

62
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,043
quite literally.

63
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,462
It wouldn't hurt to take a peek inside.

64
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,964
Huh?

65
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,465
What is it?

66
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:03,011
Whoa! Look at all that gold,
silver, and gems!

67
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,596
-Wow!
-Awesome!

68
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,973
Can I have some?

69
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,850
Money, so much.

70
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,647
I thought all the treasure in this place
had already been looted.

71
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,568
Maybe this is one of the strange things
happening inside the dungeon.

72
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:26,701
In any case, it's a big help.

73
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,370
Venturing into the lower levels
is quite expensive, after all.

74
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:35,084
All right. Let's call it a day for now
and return to town!

75
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,377
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

76
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,764
Looks like a party got wiped out here.

77
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,517
Oh dear. Seems like they were
on their way back to town.

78
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,061
The poor things.

79
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,979
I don't see any visible injuries.

80
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,190
Maybe they were attacked
by a type of ghost.

81
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,358
Maybe they starved.

82
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,320
No, I think they had a quarrel over money.

83
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,201
The corpse retriever
will probably find them soon,

84
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,953
but I'll pray for them
so they don't become zombies.

85
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,748
I can't do it the way Falin does, though.

86
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,172
What should we do
with their scattered stuff?

87
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,216
Let's gather them in one spot.

88
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,220
I bet they'll end up
in the corpse retriever's pockets, though.

89
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,766
Huh? What was that for?

90
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,101
I-It's nothing.

91
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:36,104
<i>My sword suddenly jumped.</i>

92
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,858
<i>What's going on? It was calm until now.</i>

93
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,361
<i>Hey, don't wrap around my fingers!</i>

94
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,740
<i>"Draw me!"</i>

95
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:51,035
<i>It feels like that's what it's saying!</i>

96
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,506
Marcille! Get away from the bodies!

97
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,757
Huh?

98
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,741
Stunning magic, huh?

99
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,828
Thank goodness it wasn't an explosion.

100
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:34,745
Ow!

101
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,038
Ugh, what the heck?!

102
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,791
They're all Treasure Bugs! Gross!

103
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,253
I see.

104
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,922
So they were all wiped out
by Treasure Bugs.

105
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,134
I haven't seen them around lately,
so I didn't realize.

106
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,386
What? You did realize, though.

107
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,889
Yeah! How did you know?

108
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,140
Um…

109
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,642
I thought… it moved.

110
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,060
<i>My sword, I mean.</i>

111
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,855
<i>It's already calm again.</i>

112
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,649
<i>It probably responded
to the Treasure Bug, right?</i>

113
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,444
If that's the case…

114
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:09,280
{\an8}He's becoming less and less human.

115
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,333
There.

116
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,585
{\an8}No!

117
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,963
He's really sorting them out.

118
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,175
These are edible.

119
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,468
And these aren't.

120
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,887
Do they taste good, though?

121
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,263
Of course.

122
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,975
Bugs are an excellent source of nutrition.

123
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,727
They have a delicious taste
and flavor, too.

124
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,730
And they look good as well.

125
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,607
Don't show its underside to us.

126
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,902
How can you tell
whether they're edible or not?

127
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,237
It depends.

128
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,614
This one is easy to tell.

129
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,368
The necklace has legs growing
between its segments.

130
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,121
With brooches and coins,
you look at their underside.

131
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:03,125
It's interesting how Coin Bugs
have different designs based on their sex.

132
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,671
Rings have a springy shank.

133
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,508
With tiaras, dunk them in water,
and you can tell them apart easily.

134
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,885
If they float, they're Treasure Bugs.

135
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,136
They're light, after all.

136
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,307
Anyway, let's cook them
while they're still senseless.

137
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,018
To improve their texture,

138
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:24,021
remove the legs from the pearl centipedes.

139
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,524
Then, skewer and grill them.

140
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:31,445
Heat some oil and cook the underside
of the Coin Bugs.

141
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,031
Salt them lightly,

142
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,076
and coat them with oil as you stir them.

143
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,536
There!

144
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,164
{\an8}It looks nice if you flip them
with their backs facing up.

145
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,668
For the tiara, remove the eggs and larvae,

146
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:49,171
shatter the nest, and stew together.

147
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,050
Put them in a jar…

148
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,344
And it's done!

149
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,055
NATURAL AND TASTY TREASURE BUG SNACKS

150
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:02,810
{\an8}It looks nice, but it doesn't really
whet my appetite in more ways than one.

151
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,772
That said, I have eaten a Coin Bug before.

152
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,442
There are local cuisines like this.

153
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:12,820
It looks lucky,
and it's supposed to bring good fortune.

154
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,783
{\an8}It's way better
than the one I had a long time ago!

155
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,577
Of course, it is.

156
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,332
Monsters inside the dungeon
generally taste better than those outside.

157
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:28,961
If you keep them outside,
their flavor quickly deteriorates.

158
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,806
It's gooey.

159
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,851
I can't wear necklaces anymore.

160
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,853
They're like small fish and pretty tasty.

161
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,690
The same monster will taste better
when they're from the lower levels.

162
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:50,900
I can't wait to try it.

163
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,360
Thank you.

164
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,366
<i>It's sweet and delicious.</i>

165
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,327
<i>They really look just like gems.</i>

166
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,247
<i>In the context of concealing itself
from enemies through camouflage,</i>

167
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,291
<i>it's one of your kind.</i>

168
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,210
<i>Is that why you responded?</i>

169
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,253
<i>Wait…</i>

170
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,173
Give me one.

171
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,231
Nothing.

172
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,568
<i>That was intimidation.</i>

173
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,906
<i>Did it try to defeat the bug with me
because it thinks I'm a friend?</i>

174
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,659
<i>You cute thing!</i>

175
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,244
<i>Let me give you a name.</i>

176
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,623
Let's get going soon.

177
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,501
Can I throw away the inedible ones?

178
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,794
If you want.

179
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,798
What happens if you eat the inedible ones?

180
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,300
Do they taste bad? Or are they poisonous?

181
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,553
What are you talking about?

182
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,807
You can't possibly eat real gems.

183
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,686
<i>You can't possibly eat real gems.</i>

184
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,062
<i>Real gems…</i>

185
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,648
<i>Gems…</i>

186
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,901
{\an8}-You should have said that first!
-You should have said that first!

187
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,032
I know! Your name is Kensuke!

188
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,505
You're still munching on that?

189
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,382
It's heartier than it looks.

190
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,718
Seriously, you're making it hard
to keep my guard up.

191
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,684
It suddenly got cold.

192
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,771
That white hazy thing…

193
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,733
That's a lot of ghosts.

194
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,735
Let's go.
It wouldn't do for us to be spotted.

195
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,112
Ghosts?

196
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,698
They must've gathered,
attracted by the corpses.

197
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,869
{\an8}Can't you simply use magic to…

198
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,415
{\an8}Right. Falin isn't with us.

199
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,334
{\an8}I miss her, too.

200
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,004
It was the least I could do,
but I prayed for them.

201
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,632
So I don't think
the ghosts will possess the bodies there…

202
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,931
There's one behind us.

203
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,390
Run!

204
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,367
Stupid!

205
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,877
My ears…

206
00:13:56,961 --> 00:13:58,879
Hurry! Before another one comes!

207
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,635
Looks like that noise
attracted their attention even more.

208
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,015
Don't you know other magic
besides something so flashy?

209
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:13,143
Something random like the stuff
Falin used would have done.

210
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:18,190
{\an8}Random? Don't you know
how advanced her magic was?

211
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,778
Falin, Laios' sister,

212
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,031
was good at dealing with ghosts.

213
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,326
<i>Lifgant Ardinbam.</i>

214
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:33,873
There! That should do it.

215
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,375
Ghosts can't harm you anymore.

216
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,505
Isn't it easier to blow up ghosts
when they show up?

217
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,633
It should be easy with your magic, Falin.

218
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,513
I'd rather not do stuff like that.

219
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:54,977
A dispersed ghost will simply return
to its normal state over time.

220
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,146
It causes them unnecessary suffering.

221
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,856
How sweet of you.

222
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,400
I admire your principles, but…

223
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,071
Those who steal another person's body…

224
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,867
deserve some punishment, don't you think?

225
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,418
He's one of the missing adventurers.

226
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,963
All right. Give me a moment.

227
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,007
I'll neutralize him and…

228
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,219
Let me handle it.
There's no need to harm it.

229
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,806
Wait, Falin! Don't do anything reckless!

230
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,821
I'm sorry. Please return him.

231
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,536
Falin!

232
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:03,087
Seems like she was an important person.

233
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,715
Yeah. Falin was really amazing.

234
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,844
If the ghosts catch up with us,

235
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,348
I'll have to do something with my magic.

236
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,307
Forget it!

237
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,519
Are you planning to explode
all those ghosts individually?

238
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,733
So, I should do what Falin did, right?

239
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,778
Make them explode with a gentle embrace.

240
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,780
Make them explode with a gentle embrace.

241
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,116
-Make them explode with…
-No way! You couldn't possibly!

242
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,828
You said yourself you can't do it
the way Falin does it!

243
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,746
Falin wouldn't say that, though!

244
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,499
Anyway, what if you run out of magic?

245
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:44,003
That's why I'm trying to make them explode
with the minimal amount of magic needed!

246
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,171
And I'm saying you can't do that!

247
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,506
Hey, both of you…

248
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:51,969
Turns out it's not that easy
to run from the dead.

249
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,263
Right.

250
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,016
They'll catch us if we bicker
in a place like this.

251
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,269
Wait, what are you doing?

252
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,647
I'll prepare a charm
to drive away the ghosts.

253
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,524
A charm?

254
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,608
Holy water.

255
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,444
You had that on you?

256
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,654
No. I'm going to make it now.

257
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,698
{\an8}Make it?

258
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,658
{\an8}Are you a priest or something?

259
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,414
<i>There are many customs around the world
to ward off different demons.</i>

260
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,957
<i>For example, lighting a fire.</i>

261
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:26,462
<i>Fire drives away the darkness
and has the power to create and take.</i>

262
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,921
<i>Everywhere and throughout the ages,</i>

263
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,508
<i>fire has been used
to ward off demons and as something holy.</i>

264
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,927
That's true,

265
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,138
but will the light of a candle
ward off ghosts?

266
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,974
While each may be weak on their own,

267
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,019
together in large numbers,
they can become a substantial force.

268
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,439
<i>Another example is the golden beetle.</i>

269
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,442
<i>Its characteristics led to it
being worshipped</i>

270
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,861
as a symbol of the sun and its deity.

271
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,655
<i>Another example is alcohol.</i>

272
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,702
It's an essential offering to a god
and possesses disinfective properties.

273
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,829
<i>Another example is salt.</i>

274
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:05,459
There are customs that use it
to drive away evil and cleanse oneself.

275
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,379
Sugar is similar to that,
so I'll add some just in case.

276
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,965
It's probably less effective,
so I'll add a lot.

277
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,842
You're totally winging this!

278
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,969
Aside from that, there are herbs

279
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,263
and the internal organs of creatures.

280
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,308
Add the power of fire to this and…

281
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,313
We have holy water!

282
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,856
SPECIAL FUSION HOLY WATER

283
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,026
Here they come!

284
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:34,196
Tightly seal the jar of holy water and…

285
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,114
Seal?!

286
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,657
Aren't you going to use it?

287
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,658
Be patient.

288
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,243
Then, tie it with string…

289
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,872
At this rate…

290
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,799
<i>Oh no…</i>

291
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,635
<i>Falin.</i>

292
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,934
<i>That day, if only she didn't shield me…</i>

293
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,646
<i>If I were the one devoured
by the dragon instead,</i>

294
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:11,191
<i>this sorry mess would never have happened.</i>

295
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:13,735
<i>Forgive me.</i>

296
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,250
Huh?

297
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,012
For a moment just now,
I saw my dead dad beyond the river.

298
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,432
W-What on earth?

299
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:47,394
<i>The ghosts that come in contact
with the jar of holy water are dispersing.</i>

300
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,818
That holy water is doing the trick, huh?

301
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,320
That actually works?

302
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,700
Maybe we were being possessed…

303
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,202
by Falin.

304
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,078
How could you say that?

305
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,955
Falin would never do such a thing.

306
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,999
She isn't a ghost yet in the first place!

307
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,709
No, that's not what I meant.

308
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,379
We shouldn't say stuff like,
"Only Falin could have done this,"

309
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,341
or "Things would've been easier
if Falin was around."

310
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,093
Right now, it's just us.

311
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,097
So we have to take care
of things on our own.

312
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:28,977
You're right.

313
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:30,896
Senshi!

314
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,232
Let me help.

315
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,708
It's over.

316
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,129
I-It's completely covered in frost!

317
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:01,093
Using it like this is more effective
than scattering it, don't you think?

318
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,094
True.

319
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,387
Ghosts can pass through walls,

320
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,472
so it won't matter
if the jar is sealed or not.

321
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,475
But what is this?

322
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,774
You made ice cream.

323
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,904
EXORCISM SORBET TO DRIVE AWAY EVILS

324
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:24,616
Is it safe to eat something
that came in contact with so many ghosts?

325
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,288
And consuming such potent holy water
could cause problems as well.

326
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:33,166
I think I'm taking too much sugar today.

327
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,505
It's good!

328
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,472
You're right. It's good!

329
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,100
It tastes really fresh!

330
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,438
{\an8}Seems like we managed to drive away
the ghosts without making them too upset.

331
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,397
{\an8}True!

332
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,190
You added the internal organs
of a creature.

333
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,026
What creature?

334
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,278
I added some Slime shavings.

335
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,613
So that's why it jiggles a little.

336
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,907
I love how smooth the texture is.

337
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:11,955
This… makes me think…

338
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,669
If Falin were here, we probably
couldn't have had such tasty food.

339
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,672
{\an8}Huh?

340
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,507
Are you saying…

341
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,719
you're glad Falin ended up that way?

342
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,263
Is that what you're saying? Now?!

343
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,016
Huh? No, I was just…

344
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,144
There are things you should say
and things you shouldn't.

345
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,194
<i>If only Falin were here right about now.</i>

346
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,656
{\an8}He meant to say
every cloud has a silver lining.

347
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,451
{\an8}<i>She'd say something like that
to clarify what I meant!</i>

348
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:54,998
{\an8}Your bond with your friends
is what really grew cold, huh?

349
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,044
{\an8}<i>Please return soon, Falin!</i>

350
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,969
