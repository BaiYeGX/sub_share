1
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,391
I overslept!

3
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,944
I can't hear his heartbeat.

4
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,947
{\an8}Of course, you can't hear it
from over his armor.

5
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,450
He finally managed to fall asleep
a little while ago.

6
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,955
Seems like the food poisoning symptoms
are letting up as well.

7
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,458
I see. So, I made a fuss over nothing.

8
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,544
Let him sleep a little longer.

9
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:09,963
It seems he was delirious
all throughout the night.

10
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,467
{\an8}You know, here in this dungeon,
even the number of monsters

11
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,845
{\an8}that are defeated by intruders
are taken into account.

12
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,805
Even when we defeat monsters,

13
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,474
we're only maintaining
the balance of the ecosystem.

14
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,812
But if we let them be,
the monsters will wander into towns.

15
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,858
And the towns will hire adventurers
to hunt the monsters.

16
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,986
It's designed so well.

17
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,113
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,740
The design of the dungeon, of course.

19
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,370
I studied it in school a long time ago.

20
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,622
But it was really tricky.

21
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,208
Hey, look.

22
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:51,004
That's Marcille
from the graduate school, isn't it?

23
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:53,673
The most brilliant female student
in the school's history!

24
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,635
I heard she assisted a teacher
on her very first day here.

25
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:01,097
And I heard she's already on track
to become the court mage.

26
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,099
Wow, that's amazing!

27
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,896
{\an8}I didn't start as a teacher's assistant
until my fifth day of school,

28
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,149
{\an8}and as for becoming a court mage,
it's just that my parent used to be one.

29
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,280
Today, I asked the teacher
to let me join the class.

30
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,532
I hope we can get along.

31
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,036
-Y-Yeah!
-Y-Yeah!

32
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:27,540
Today, we will try
a spirit breeding experiment.

33
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,919
Everyone, take a jar each and go outside.

34
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,173
<i>Prepare wooden planks with holes in them</i>

35
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:40,053
<i>and place them inside a jar,
sandwiching them between layers of soil.</i>

36
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,181
<i>Create a barrier,</i>

37
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:47,185
<i>fill the jar with magic,</i>

38
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,771
<i>and release the spirits into it.</i>

39
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:55,693
<i>The tiny spirits live solely
on the magic inside the jar.</i>

40
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,197
<i>If the magic is too strong or too weak,
they will die.</i>

41
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,909
<i>Breeding spirits is considered
the foundation of summoning magic.</i>

42
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,663
<i>Because its structure resembles that
of a dungeon that houses monsters,</i>

43
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,957
<i>it's referred to as a "dungeonium."</i>

44
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,210
When you're done,
place your jar inside the darkroom.

45
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:15,004
We'll check on them a week from now.

46
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,842
Wow, your barrier is so pretty, Marcille!

47
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,970
Are you sure this is your first time?

48
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,265
But why are you studying summoning magic?

49
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,976
It's not your main field of study, is it?

50
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,771
I'm researching how
to create a safe dungeon.

51
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,524
Right now, I'm focused
on the ingredients of magic.

52
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,484
For example,

53
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:40,571
<i>the way we currently gather Mandrakes
is quite dangerous.</i>

54
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,700
But if I can design a safe dungeon

55
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,744
and grow only
beneficial monsters inside it,

56
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,789
I believe I could contribute to society.

57
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,416
Wow.

58
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,001
That's so cool.

59
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,044
Check out Marcille's barrier!

60
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,337
It's so beautiful!

61
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,964
I want to see it, too!

62
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,507
Let me see!

63
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,925
Watch out!

64
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,388
{\an8}Are you okay?

65
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,015
{\an8}T-Thanks.

66
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,271
<i>The soil has impurities mixed in,</i>

67
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,774
<i>and there are many gaps in the barrier,
causing the magic to weaken.</i>

68
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:20,153
<i>At this rate, the spirits inside
won't be able to survive for long.</i>

69
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,156
I hope your uniform didn't get dirty.

70
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,367
That girl is always covered in mud,

71
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,162
and she keeps skipping class,
so she's always lagging behind.

72
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,795
Everyone, retrieve your jars

73
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,424
and check how many spirits
are still alive.

74
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,260
Oh no, they're all dead!

75
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,137
They're just barely alive.

76
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,847
I bred a new spirit species!

77
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,931
That's mold.

78
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:54,020
<i>If there are many spirits still alive,
the fire will burn strongly.</i>

79
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,192
Yours are almost in the same condition
as they were a week ago.

80
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,402
Good work.

81
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,369
M-My jar!

82
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:13,081
Your spirits have multiplied quite a lot.

83
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,916
What should I do?

84
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,126
I'll take care of it.

85
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,838
How did you manage to do that?

86
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,341
{\an8}I-I'm sorry.

87
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,677
{\an8}There's this place
that's always teeming with spirits,

88
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,847
{\an8}and I thought that using it
as a reference might work.

89
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,350
{\an8}Teeming with spirits?

90
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,601
{\an8}Where is this place?

91
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,853
{\an8}U-Um...

92
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,689
{\an8}This jar likely has just as many spirits
as you'd find in a dungeon.

93
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,526
This will make a splendid sample.

94
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,115
It's inside a real dungeon.

95
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:52,495
This is where I sneak outside.

96
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,748
A hidden passage?

97
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,190
Are you always doing stuff like this?

98
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,275
Yup!

99
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,029
So, that's why you're lagging behind.

100
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,499
A grasshopper!

101
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,376
Raspberries!

102
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,131
{\an8}Don't eat something so mysterious!

103
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,134
{\an8}Don't touch them, either!
They could be poisonous and dangerous!

104
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,137
T-They're not mysterious.

105
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,390
Grasshoppers and raspberries
aren't poisonous, either.

106
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,856
It's a real dungeon.

107
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,108
I've never seen one before.

108
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,238
<i>There's stagnant magic here,
and the air is still.</i>

109
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,616
<i>It's a naturally formed cave.</i>

110
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:14,535
Hey, it's dangerous!

111
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,292
Don't worry.

112
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,336
I come here often.

113
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,755
You'll be safe as long as you
stay on the dry ground.

114
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,151
Wow.

115
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,656
Dungeons really are teeming with spirits.

116
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,453
I took the soil and water from here
and placed them inside my jar.

117
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,414
I see.

118
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,084
What do you usually do when you come here?

119
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,588
I write letters and read books.

120
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,300
{\an8}<i>So, this is totally the result
of her slacking off.</i>

121
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,306
<i>Anyway, this place seems pretty safe.</i>

122
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,725
<i>Hold on.</i>

123
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,312
<i>If I cultivate this place
and plant Mandrakes,</i>

124
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,232
<i>I'll be able to use
the dungeon's magic safely.</i>

125
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,068
<i>Yes, it should work.</i>

126
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,487
<i>It's a good distance
from the water as well.</i>

127
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,159
S-Slime!

128
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,079
We should burn all monsters!

129
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,163
N-No!

130
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,544
What did you do that for?

131
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,966
It won't venture into a sunlit area.

132
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,474
{\an8}Slimes break down bat droppings
and convert them into magic.

133
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,646
Without them,
the dungeon will wither away.

134
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,900
Bats...

135
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,569
Here.

136
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,958
<i>It's good.</i>

137
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,671
<i>If they taste this good,
I'm sure other animals eat them, too.</i>

138
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,009
<i>I wonder what the bats here eat.</i>

139
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,971
<i>When do these raspberries bear fruit?</i>

140
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,182
<i>What animals feed on them?</i>

141
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:46,062
<i>Without knowing that,
I won't be able to design a dungeon.</i>

142
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,985
<i>There's so much I don't know.</i>

143
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,616
Thanks for bringing me here.

144
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:04,914
I thought all I had to do
was study magic to improve.

145
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,500
But it seems like I was mistaken.

146
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,671
By the way, um...

147
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,425
I'm Falin. What's your name?

148
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,268
I'm Marcille.

149
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,897
Falin, I'd love to be friends with you.

150
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,151
{\an8}The most brilliant female student
in the school's history?

151
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,569
{\an8}That's gotta be false.

152
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,196
It's true!

153
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,573
Back in school,
I was a top-notch student, you know!

154
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:44,829
Anyway, this dungeon
is a mind-boggling place.

155
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,832
It's calculated to a tee,

156
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,876
and continuously circulates
enormous amounts of magic.

157
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,130
If this lunatic magician really exists,

158
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,841
he's definitely far from being sane.

159
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,845
Senshi, it would be best for you
to find another place to live.

160
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,972
That's none of your concern.

161
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,724
In the first place, you hate magic,

162
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,727
but this dungeon itself
is constructed from magic!

163
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,230
I can't hear you.

164
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,691
I see.

165
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,985
So she was talking about you.

166
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,906
When my sister
had just enrolled in magic school,

167
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,742
her letters to me were full of worry.

168
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,663
<i>But ever since
she told me that she had made a friend,</i>

169
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:30,040
<i>it seemed like she was enjoying every day.</i>

170
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,253
She said you were an amazing person.

171
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,755
She was always complimenting you.

172
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,805
She complimented you, too.

173
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,515
She said she respected you.

174
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:48,893
Did she, now?

175
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,104
What's he good at?

176
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,982
He's really good at imitating a dog.

177
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,112
<i>Oh, well, I guess
this isn't the time to be whining.</i>

178
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,155
All right.

179
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,116
Let's go and rescue Falin
as soon as we can!

180
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,453
Come on!

181
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,997
If you're awake, get up already!

182
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,375
Here's where we are now.

183
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:17,630
{\an8}And this is the place the orcs mentioned
where the Red Dragon was spotted.

184
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,465
{\an8}It should take us
about two days to get there.

185
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,343
The dragon probably
won't stay in one place,

186
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,387
but it's not the sort of monster
that roams around, either.

187
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,098
Ideally, we'll set up camp
only two times more.

188
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,476
Once at the halfway point

189
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,895
and then again just before
we reach the Red Dragon.

190
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:36,232
We'll kick Laios out of bed
when the candle burns out.

191
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,067
Make sure to be ready.

192
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,402
Our next break
is going to be a little way off.

193
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,073
I want to wipe myself down.

194
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,700
Where?

195
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,327
I'll do it in the corner of the room.

196
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,330
Be quick about it.

197
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,836
We'll be waiting outside.

198
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,964
You can stay here.

199
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,590
I can do it clothed, you know.

200
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,426
If you say so.

201
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,931
<i>I'm bothering them, aren't I?</i>

202
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,269
<i>Maybe I should've studied illusion magic.</i>

203
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,604
<i>But that's not the issue, is it?</i>

204
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,732
<i>It was easier when half of us were girls.</i>

205
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,443
<i>This is where we part.</i>

206
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,905
What? Do you really have to leave now?

207
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,158
We still don't know
what happened to Falin.

208
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:33,455
Sorry, but we have to make a living, too.

209
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,585
<i>Just thinking about it is making me upset.</i>

210
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,670
<i>And I thought they were our friends!</i>

211
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,093
Get up, Laios!

212
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:47,761
Hey, wake up!

213
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,221
It's time to go!

214
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,182
There.

215
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,477
Oops. I boiled too much water.

216
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,756
U...

217
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,549
Undine!

218
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,305
What is it?

219
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,100
My staff!

220
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,234
My Water-Walk...

221
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,111
The water is moving.

222
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,948
You can't use weapons! We need fire.

223
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:49,865
Fire?

224
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,077
I could start a fire.

225
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,871
Marcille, do something on your own!

226
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,040
Easier said than done.

227
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,626
I hope I can hit it.

228
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,440
Marcille, don't just stand there!

229
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,776
Stay away from the water!

230
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,195
Your Water-Walk effects have worn off!

231
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,662
Marcille!

232
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,664
This is bad! Keep moving!

233
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,925
<i>I can't get away from it with this leg.</i>

234
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,101
<i>Where is it hiding?</i>

235
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:12,906
She's moving so slowly.
I can't bear to watch!

236
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,700
Just give me a moment to start a fire!

237
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,952
<i>It won't be ready in time...</i>

238
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:21,749
<i>I'm running low on magic.</i>

239
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,543
<i>I have to make my next attack count.</i>

240
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,091
<i>Where is it?</i>

241
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,093
<i>Where is it?</i>

242
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,971
<i>There must be some sort of sign.</i>

243
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,599
<i>There!</i>

244
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,143
<i>It's colored with blood.</i>

245
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,312
{\an8}It's so fast.

246
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,154
Marcille!

247
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,048
Hey.

248
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,550
It's...

249
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,388
There's only one thing to do.

250
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,811
Run!

251
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,527
Marcille, how are you doing?

252
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,532
I stopped the bleeding,
but I'm low on blood and magic.

253
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,408
I can't make a full recovery.

254
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,452
{\an8}Sorry.

255
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,411
{\an8}Don't be.

256
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,122
Rest for a bit.

257
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,165
Yeah.

258
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:49,419
I should've paid more attention
to Falin's healing magic lessons.

259
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,922
Hey, Laios.

260
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,467
What do we do now?

261
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,138
We can't continue on
with a mage out of magic.

262
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,850
And we can't move forward
without Water-Walk either.

263
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,185
Let's wait
for other adventurers to come by.

264
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,188
One of them might be a healer or a mage.

265
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:13,235
You really think a helpful adventurer
will just happen to show up?

266
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,571
We don't even have anything
to offer in return anyway.

267
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,866
The only thing we have is Kelpie meat.

268
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,076
Better hope our adventurer
is starving, then.

269
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,288
This source of nutrition
is a precious rarity in this dungeon.

270
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,999
That's beside the point!

271
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:29,585
Meat.

272
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,629
Do you have its liver as well?

273
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,964
Of course.

274
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,092
After all, the liver is rich in iron.

275
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,638
{\an8}Iron...

276
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:42,973
{\an8}This means...

277
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,435
-A barbecue!
-A barbecue!

278
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:56,486
Mane, neck, liver,

279
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,491
ribs, tail, round, loin,

280
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,118
and vegetables.

281
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,122
KELPIE GRILLED MEAT

282
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:08,874
Marcille.

283
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,751
Marcille.

284
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,129
Can you sit up?

285
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,882
We prepared something nice for you.

286
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,274
Round meat.

287
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,276
What about the liver?

288
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,655
The guts should be cooked thoroughly.

289
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:46,036
{\an8}Sorry, Marcille. I'll be eating first.

290
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,041
It's not so gamey.

291
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,044
Yeah, it's a bit stringy, but it's good.

292
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,756
Does it taste more like a horse
or a marine animal?

293
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,551
It's too bad I haven't had the chance
to try either, so I can't say.

294
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,178
Rib meat.

295
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,806
The fat tastes sweet.

296
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,391
It's so soft.

297
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,060
Marcille, the liver is done.

298
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:11,728
Tenderloin meat.

299
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,982
It melts in your mouth.

300
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,316
I love this.

301
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,568
More liver for you, Marcille.

302
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,362
Tail meat.

303
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,072
It's good.

304
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,658
It tastes pretty interesting.

305
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,201
Have more, Marcille.

306
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,954
More liver, Marcille.

307
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,580
Is it good, Marcille?

308
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,207
Eat up, Marcille.

309
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,251
How do you like it, Marcille?

310
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,177
Let me eat the other parts, too!

311
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,310
Looks like she's regained some energy.

312
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,978
Liver sure is potent.

313
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:56,481
But what are we going to do
about her magic shortage?

314
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:59,484
If only there was a meat
that could replenish magic.

315
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,237
Why did you stuff magic grass
in a Basilisk?

316
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,740
I believe it was the best choice.

317
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,872
Is it just me,
or do you also smell something?

318
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,874
It's coming from below.

319
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,542
What is that smell?

320
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,420
Is it the scent of grilling meat?

321
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,505
Someone must be cooking.

322
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,675
What, seriously?

323
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,761
What kind of fool

324
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,181
cooks meat in a place like this?

325
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,897
