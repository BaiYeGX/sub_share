1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,803
While you guys were turning
to stone, bleeding from your nose,

3
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,722
and getting engrossed in hunting for food,

4
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,059
I managed to find some patterns
in the shifts of the dungeon.

5
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,561
It's not like I wanted
to be turned to stone.

6
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:44,771
Hear, hear!

7
00:01:44,854 --> 00:01:47,315
The past three days
have been very productive!

8
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,441
Yeah, whatever.

9
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,569
One path gets blocked
and another one opens up.

10
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,446
It's basically this on repeat.

11
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:57,826
The number of doors, furniture,
and types of buildings stay the same.

12
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,328
A house never transforms into a graveyard.

13
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,832
The walls move in a clockwise spiral
at regular intervals.

14
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:07,418
The positions of the stone statues
and the directions they face are fixed.

15
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,337
Based on all that and more…

16
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,135
I remember this street.

17
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,971
That's the house where we ate the Dragon.

18
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,056
Chilchuck, you're a genius!

19
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,058
Well, it's all in a day's work.

20
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,812
But this street…

21
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,856
<i>Exactly.</i>

22
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,941
<i>It's where we lost Falin.</i>

23
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,861
<i>There was a pool of blood
and traces of something being dragged.</i>

24
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,820
<i>It's Falin!</i>

25
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,322
<i>If those two catch sight of it,
they'll get worked up for sure.</i>

26
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,116
<i>How am I going to make them stay calm?</i>

27
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,367
Laios, look!

28
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,744
What is this?

29
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,539
Listen! I get that there's a lot
to be concerned about,

30
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,417
but for now, let's focus
on getting back to the surface and…

31
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,252
Huh?

32
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,635
The Dragon's carcass was here, right?

33
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,846
It's vanished, without a trace.

34
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:06,019
But this crack in the wall must've been
made when the Red Dragon fell.

35
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,980
But even this crack is being repaired…

36
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,361
The magician's eye will be upon you.

37
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,657
Don't yell like that!

38
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,576
Just now, I saw…

39
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,456
I think it's mana sickness again.

40
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,624
Again?

41
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:32,086
Ever since I used healing magic,
I sometimes see and hear things.

42
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,463
You hear things?

43
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,465
Are you sure it's mana sickness?

44
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,799
What did you hear?

45
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,719
"The magician's eye will be upon you."

46
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,512
"The magician's eye"?

47
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:43,723
Could it be…

48
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,604
The sound of wings!

49
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:50,980
It's that Little Dragon!

50
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,106
We need to hide!

51
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,650
Hide where exactly?

52
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,735
This place is too exposed.

53
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,737
We've got to run, Marcille!

54
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,614
No, I know where to hide.

55
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,575
Inside the wall!

56
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,830
Come on, you two! Hurry!

57
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,123
Is this…

58
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,376
Another one of her spells?

59
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:30,770
Marcille, what kind of magic was that?

60
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,942
Cleaners?

61
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,360
What?

62
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,861
Dungeon Cleaners.

63
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,030
They're creatures, I think,

64
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,409
that keep the dungeon clean
and fix up any damages.

65
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,326
Exactly.

66
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:49,038
{\an8}I figured this wall
wasn't completely set yet.

67
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,416
Up until this point is the original wall,

68
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,710
and from here on are Cleaners.

69
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,919
Even the floor!

70
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:55,837
Check it out!

71
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,715
Even the wear and tear
and tiny scratches are being recreated.

72
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,092
You can't tell the difference by sight.

73
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,304
Ugh!

74
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,807
There are tiny things
crawling all over the floor!

75
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,808
Gross!

76
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,227
{\an8}They're all Cleaners.

77
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,564
{\an8}Any dungeon without them
would fall apart in no time.

78
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,066
They're not monsters and aren't harmful.

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,735
They are harmful.

80
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:22,071
These suckers often nibble on my tent.

81
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,952
<i>They break down anything
they think is in the way.</i>

82
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,831
<i>They must've come to eat the remains
of the Dragon and the explosion.</i>

83
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,542
They show up when the dungeon is damaged,

84
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,587
and their secretion prevents fires
from spreading and further collapses.

85
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,007
Then they start devouring
any scattered rubble.

86
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,341
They're not picky eaters.

87
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,179
Finally, they excrete secretions
to fill in the broken areas

88
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,806
and restore the dungeon
to its former state.

89
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,976
It's similar to how creatures heal.

90
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,478
All things considered,

91
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,564
monsters act like the immune system,
clearing out germs.

92
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,857
Who are you calling germs?

93
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,568
Is that also magic at work?

94
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,861
Pretty cool, huh?

95
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,237
Good grief.

96
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,782
What's next, a magical digestive system?

97
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,452
I wonder what the dungeon
would eat in that case?

98
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:13,706
<i>Thank goodness the bloodstains are gone.</i>

99
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,416
{\an8}Hey.

100
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,752
{\an8}Let's get moving
before the dungeon shifts again.

101
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,711
Right.

102
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,686
{\an8}Stairs!

103
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,981
{\an8}Finally, a way out.

104
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:42,527
Well then, how about
we start preparing that?

105
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,154
Good idea. Let's do that.

106
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,572
That?

107
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,574
Oh, you mean that.

108
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,127
Huh? By that, you meant a meal?

109
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,712
I don't think there are
any Tentacles on this level.

110
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,131
You should've said earlier!

111
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,924
You actually like that outfit, don't you?

112
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:05,883
I don't!

113
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,557
We've got so many ingredients,
I'm not sure what to make.

114
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,268
Maybe I can try using that.

115
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,311
Cook up some grain.

116
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,397
Is it the stuff from the third floor?

117
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,234
I was saving it
for when we ran out of food.

118
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,903
Chop up some Cockatrice meat,

119
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,780
Dryad fruit,

120
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,407
Mandrake fruit and leaves,

121
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,660
and depetrification herbs,

122
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:35,163
Season them and sauté.

123
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,666
Spread a layer of cooked grain
inside hollowed-out bricks.

124
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,919
Add the toppings
and heat them, brick and all.

125
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:43,921
And…

126
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,798
Huh? What's that?

127
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,675
A Cockatrice egg.

128
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,929
I brought one along,

129
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,432
but it's been a bit tricky to use.

130
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,687
Finally, pour on the egg sauce and

131
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,105
{\an8}it's ready.

132
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,691
{\an8}STONE-BAKED COCKATRICE
CHICKEN AND EGG WITH SAUCE

133
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,485
Wow, what is this?

134
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,611
It looks delicious!

135
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:11,449
<i>If I'd stayed petrified,
would they have used me to make this dish?</i>

136
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,331
The scorched grain is nice!

137
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:21,375
Try digging your spoon into the dish.

138
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,341
I used bricks made from Dungeon Cleaners.

139
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,801
So we can even eat the dish?

140
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,138
Thanks, Senshi!

141
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:39,977
What does it taste like?

142
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,313
At first, it tastes like dirt.

143
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,898
But as you savor it,

144
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,193
it's like this magical blend
of green caterpillar, iron, and lemon.

145
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,779
You're just comparing it to other things.

146
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,782
There's no other way to describe it.

147
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,701
Are you sure it's safe
to eat magical creatures?

148
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:58,371
It might make you hear things
and bleed from your nose again.

149
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,581
I wonder what's with those hallucinations.

150
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,710
When we get back to town,
you should really see a doctor

151
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,628
for your head.

152
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,629
A doctor?

153
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,006
Do you think it's some kind of illness?

154
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,139
Is this another hallucination?

155
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,016
Are you guys seeing this?

156
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,644
I-I see it.

157
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,647
I mean, we're…

158
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:26,857
under attack!

159
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,781
Huh? What on earth?

160
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,408
It's just frog skin.

161
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:40,037
Looks like these horns
are just decorations on a helmet.

162
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,872
A child?

163
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,919
Some monsters
disguise themselves as humans.

164
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:51,299
Let's try killing one to see
if they'll reveal their true colors--

165
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,217
Don't, Maizuru.

166
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,347
I know them.

167
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,599
-Shuro!
-Shuro!

168
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,727
{\an8}Shuro, long time no see!

169
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,480
What a pleasant surprise
to run into you here!

170
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,232
Did you lose weight?

171
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,617
Thanks, Shuro!

172
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,037
Glad to see you're doing well.

173
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,872
Goodness! How forward of him!

174
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,457
Oh, let me introduce you.

175
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,417
This is Senshi.

176
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,879
Senshi, meet Shuro,
our former party member.

177
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,839
{\an8}Shuro? Who's that?

178
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,008
{\an8}They probably mean Young Master Toshiro.

179
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,636
Toshuro?

180
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,098
Let's continue
our conversation sitting down.

181
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,184
We were just having a meal.

182
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,645
Would you all like to…

183
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,732
Huh? You've got quite a big group!

184
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,151
Hey, Kabru.

185
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,319
Is that…

186
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,906
Nice to meet you.

187
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,034
You're Laios, aren't you?

188
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:02,953
Yeah.

189
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,288
Nice to meet you.

190
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,794
How long has it been?

191
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,546
Hey, Kabru.

192
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,382
It's them, right?

193
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,175
The ones who stole our stuff.

194
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,718
What will you do?

195
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,679
Nothing.

196
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,597
Huh?

197
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,808
What did we come all the way here for?

198
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,022
I wanted to meet them.

199
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,357
Huh?

200
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:34,568
<i>I doubt asking them
about the treasure will help.</i>

201
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,822
<i>He didn't look guilty even when he saw us.</i>

202
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,867
{\an8}Either he doesn't remember,
or we're mistaken.

203
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,662
{\an8}Or maybe the treasure itself was a trap.

204
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,330
{\an8}Or maybe all of them.

205
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,249
{\an8}Are you saying
we made this trip for nothing?

206
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,458
{\an8}Don't be hasty.

207
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,127
{\an8}Give me a bit more time.

208
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,380
Don't you want to find out
how they managed to get here

209
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,800
and what they plan to do in the future?

210
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:02,555
So, you've been
on this level for a while now?

211
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,514
Yeah.

212
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,766
<i>We kept going around in circles,</i>

213
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,768
<i>and when we got out,
we were back at the entrance.</i>

214
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,521
<i>We got lost a lot too.</i>

215
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,774
But Chilchuck
found patterns in the shifts,

216
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,110
and that's how we finally made it here.

217
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,027
I see.

218
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,030
Anyway, Shuro, you…

219
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,452
You lech!

220
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,162
Are they the connections you mentioned?

221
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,288
Lucky you!

222
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,249
They're just retainers.

223
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,751
{\an8}They're quite skilled, though.

224
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,880
{\an8}I'm sorry for leaving the party.

225
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,925
{\an8}But when I realized Falin
was missing up on the surface,

226
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:46,015
I thought this was the best way
to get back into the dungeon and find her.

227
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,309
Forgive me.

228
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,311
It's fine. There was no other way.

229
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,523
But I'm surprised you went back
into the dungeon right after that.

230
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,192
Wasn't it a little rash?

231
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:59,653
What would you have done
if someone got hurt again?

232
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,073
Just so you know,

233
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,328
the four of us
even defeated the Red Dragon!

234
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,329
What?!

235
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,039
The Red Dragon?

236
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,833
A-And what about her?

237
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,338
Shuro!

238
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,255
Young Master!

239
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:22,384
{\an8}I beg you, please eat and get some sleep!

240
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,512
{\an8}At this rate, your body will break down!

241
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,722
You're pushing yourself that hard?

242
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:29,475
Look at how gaunt he is.
You should've noticed.

243
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,103
You should get food and sleep, you know.

244
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,774
I don't have time for that.

245
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,653
{\an8}Shuro, eating isn't something
you do when you have time.

246
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,864
It's only after having sleep and food

247
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,076
that creatures can
finally do what they want.

248
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,995
Have something to eat.

249
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,040
While you do, I'll fill you in
on what happened.

250
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,627
Fine.

251
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,880
Can you prepare something, Maizuru?

252
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,553
A meal! Prepare a meal!

253
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,930
Tade, go fetch some water!

254
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,056
On it!

255
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:12,768
Hien, Benichidori, get ready to cook rice.

256
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,854
Asebi, you…

257
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:19,275
guard the Young Master.

258
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,694
I don't want anything strange
mixed into the food.

259
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,697
Well then, I'll get the fire going.

260
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,448
You are considerate.

261
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,033
I'll leave it to you, dwarf.

262
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,453
A meal, a meal!

263
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,455
This group is too big.

264
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,709
It's not safe for so many people
to gather in one place.

265
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,878
Let's split up into three.

266
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:41,714
In that case,

267
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,091
Rin, dwarf,

268
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,551
frog woman!

269
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,468
What?!

270
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,805
Everyone who can use magic,
put up a barrier.

271
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,434
Make sure no monsters disturb
the Young Master while he eats.

272
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,354
Let's work together, young lady.

273
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,189
R-Right.

274
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,941
Okay then,

275
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,068
Shuro, let's step away too.

276
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,487
I'll give you a quick rundown.

277
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,947
I'll help support him.

278
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:07,865
Thanks.

279
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,242
There's so much to do!

280
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:14,246
<i>In this case,
who's more dangerous if left alone?</i>

281
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,625
Monsters! Delicious! Awesome!

282
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,961
Monsters! Cook! Eat!

283
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,087
Eat this!

284
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,631
Die.

285
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,383
{\an8}Senshi, I'm coming with you!

286
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,399
Hey, aren't you overdoing it?

287
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,525
The smoke…

288
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,488
After this meal,
I must make him take a bath.

289
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,530
<i>Here?</i>

290
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,075
Okay, Shuro, sit here.

291
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,494
Never mind that,
just tell me what happened.

292
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,289
After you and Namari left, we--

293
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,624
Just give me the gist.

294
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,796
We defeated the Red Dragon,
retrieved Falin, and revived her.

295
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,423
But on our way back,
we were attacked by the lunatic magician,

296
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,716
and we lost her.

297
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,053
There was nothing more
we could do on our own,

298
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:14,640
{\an8}so we decided to head back
to the surface and ask for backup.

299
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,350
{\an8}But we got lost and…

300
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,270
But I'm glad we
crossed paths with you, Shuro!

301
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,189
Will you help us out?

302
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,277
Um, can I ask something?

303
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,157
The lunatic magician is the one
who created this dungeon, right?

304
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,411
<i>There are rumors and whispers about him,</i>

305
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:38,080
<i>but no one who's seen him
has ever returned.</i>

306
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,249
How can you be sure it was him?

307
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,834
Huh?

308
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,586
Well, he sounded and acted like it.

309
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,840
And how did you manage to escape?

310
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,299
It was thanks to Marcille…

311
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,845
The mage in our party protected us.

312
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,096
How exactly?

313
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,806
Um…

314
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,435
Magic isn't my area of expertise,
so I'm not sure.

315
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,562
I see.

316
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,566
I have a question too.

317
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,159
Why were you munching on a brick?

318
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,660
Huh?

319
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,370
Oh, it's not what it seems.

320
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,663
That wasn't a brick.

321
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,332
It was part of a wall
made from Dungeon Cleaners.

322
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,336
We left all our food
and money behind, right?

323
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,175
So to get down into the dungeon faster,
we fed on monsters along the way.

324
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,475
That…

325
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,604
is just hilarious!

326
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,521
Huh?

327
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,732
What was the tastiest thing
you've eaten so far?

328
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,983
You want to know?

329
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,234
That's a tough one.

330
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,153
{\an8}Kelpie, Living Armor…

331
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,238
{\an8}No, it's got to be the Red Dragon!

332
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,200
{\an8}You ate the Red Dragon
that ate your sister?

333
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,451
{\an8}Yeah.

334
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,120
Living Armor, though.
Are there any edible parts?

335
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,747
That's a good question!

336
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,958
Actually, it's a colony of mollusks
wearing a shell and…

337
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,251
Here, check out this sword.

338
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:09,004
The Cleaners are trying to eat Kensuke!

339
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,006
You just can't be too careful!

340
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,884
By the way, if you're interested
in monster cuisine,

341
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,469
I'd be happy to treat you anytime.

342
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,679
Wow, I'd love that!

343
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,891
<i>Crap. This guy will actually
take me up on it.</i>

344
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,521
So after she…

345
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,358
After Falin was revived,
was she safe the last time you saw her?

346
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,151
Yeah.

347
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,861
Any idea where she might be?

348
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:35,989
There are plenty of places
to hide on this level,

349
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,158
but most of them are the orcs' base camps.

350
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,869
Oh, you don't have to worry about them.

351
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,829
What?

352
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,915
What did they taste like?

353
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:45,999
No!

354
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,086
It's a long story,
but we're cooperating with them now.

355
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,339
Cooperating with them?

356
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,551
<i>Has he forgotten that killing them
is our duty as adventurers?</i>

357
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,053
Anyway, about Falin's whereabouts,

358
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,056
she might be somewhere
lower than this level.

359
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,017
She could have been taken there.

360
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,562
{\an8}Taken? Why?

361
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,230
{\an8}Um…

362
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,525
{\an8}<i>Is it safe to tell Shuro?</i>

363
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,945
Would you mind if I talked to him alone?

364
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,072
Sure, I'll step out.

365
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,081
So?

366
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,966
Field ration pellets aren't bad,
but having them every day?

367
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,678
Sometimes, you need something
warm in your belly.

368
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,846
I agree.

369
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,017
A meal should be more than
about filling the stomach.

370
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,060
I see you have sense, dwarf.

371
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,355
The Young Master
was often sick as a child.

372
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:54,484
He also had a small appetite,
which worried everyone.

373
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:59,781
<i>But he always had a hearty appetite
for whatever I made him.</i>

374
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,076
<i>Even during missions,
I was often sent to the kitchen.</i>

375
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:07,289
He was such a well-behaved child,
it made me concerned.

376
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,002
This is the first time
he's ever made a selfish request.

377
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,670
Please, Maizuru.

378
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,089
There's someone I want to save.

379
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,217
Lend me your aid.

380
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,554
I never imagined he'd become

381
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,474
infatuated with a Northern girl
on his training journey.

382
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,768
How do I convince him to move on?

383
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,270
You want him to move on?

384
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:34,066
I've been tasked by the lord
to care for the Young Master.

385
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,777
I can't let my emotions
dictate my actions.

386
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,280
Then why are you doing what you're doing?

387
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:45,369
If you have preserved foods,
you don't have to bother with cooking.

388
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,540
I know why he had an appetite
for your cooking only.

389
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,877
I know what you put into them.

390
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:54,795
Huh?

391
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,756
It was love.

392
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,802
What is that supposed to mean?

393
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:03,637
Were you trying to be clever?

394
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,976
But yes, I suppose
it's a little too late now.

395
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,561
Depending on how things turn out,

396
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,064
perhaps I can speak on his behalf.

397
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,941
{\an8}TSUGUYOSHI NAKAMOTO

398
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,067
{\an8}TOSHITSUGU NAKAMOTO

399
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,652
{\an8}NOW, TOSHIRO NAKAMOTO

400
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:19,861
{\an8}FALIRO NAKAMOTO

401
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,822
{\an8}It's using different art materials!

402
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,700
{\an8}I don't think that's likely just yet.

403
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,577
Good. This will do.

404
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,996
{\an8}It's ready.

405
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:31,581
{\an8}AN EASTERN MEAL

406
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,585
Now then, let us serve it while it's hot!

407
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,465
What are you two doing here?

408
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,426
They wanted to talk privately.

409
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,804
Young Master, I'm coming in.

410
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,015
Young Master!

411
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,767
What happened?

412
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,812
Did this man try something?

413
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,691
Well? What happened?!

414
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,027
Sorry. We don't know.

415
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,988
Black magic.

416
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:07,868
This man used black magic
to revive a woman using monster flesh.

417
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,119
Black…?

418
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,998
How could you?

419
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,375
Do you even realize what you've done?

420
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:17,919
Anyone involved with black magic,

421
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:21,882
no matter their motives
or degree of magic, is a serious criminal!

422
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,676
They're locked up
in the dark until they die,

423
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,428
and even their corpses never return.

424
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,724
If the elves of the west find out,
who knows what will happen to her?

425
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,977
{\an8}That is, if word
gets out from this dungeon.

426
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,481
{\an8}And I know you will
never tell anyone about this.

427
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,108
Right?

428
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,698
It was the only way.

429
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,742
Please understand, Shuro.

430
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,996
<i>Black magic?</i>

431
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,083
<i>This is way worse than I thought.</i>

432
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,459
<i>What's going to happen now?</i>

433
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,984
Lord Delgal…

434
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,030
I must find him.

435
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,957
