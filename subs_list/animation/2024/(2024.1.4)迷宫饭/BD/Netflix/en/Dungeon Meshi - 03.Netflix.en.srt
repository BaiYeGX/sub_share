1
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,927
I'm so tired.

3
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,178
All these stairs…

4
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,180
doesn't it feel like
you're twice as tired?

5
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,183
A moderate amount of fatigue
makes your meal taste better.

6
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,976
In moderation, sure.

7
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,438
Give me your sword.

8
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,815
Sure.

9
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,945
There should be a trick door around here.

10
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,793
I almost forgot that the door led here.

11
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,753
It saved us quite a bit of time.

12
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,632
Huh?

13
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,342
What is it?

14
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,679
The decoration on my sword guard is gone.

15
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:20,098
It's because you were reckless with it.

16
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,058
Was it my fault?

17
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,645
No, it was coming loose for a while now.

18
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:30,650
<i>I was trying to hold it together
with string or glue,</i>

19
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:31,734
<i>but I guess it was time.</i>

20
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,821
{\an8}Is there a problem if it's gone?

21
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,447
{\an8}Nope. Not at all.

22
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,576
{\an8}Was it a memento or something?

23
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,537
{\an8}A memento… I suppose you could say that.

24
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,708
<i>Three years ago,
when I was just a beginner,</i>

25
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,169
<i>I joined a gold-peeling crew
to get some experience.</i>

26
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,088
<i>Gold-peeling?</i>

27
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:55,466
<i>A long time ago, this castle
was completely covered in gold,</i>

28
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,343
<i>and peeling it made quite a profit.</i>

29
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,265
This place has been
mostly peeled already.

30
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,976
Let's see if there's anything
inside the castle.

31
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,144
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

32
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:10,523
Laios, isn't it dangerous for us to enter
the castle with our current abilities?

33
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:14,319
Yeah, but the two of us
can't turn back on our own.

34
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,327
What the hell?

35
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,786
How awful.

36
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,747
It's completely rotten away.

37
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,999
I guess that's what happens
if you die in here.

38
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,876
No one finds you.

39
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,754
Hey! Come over here!

40
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,055
You could probably sell these.

41
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,681
They're better than what we saw earlier,

42
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,142
but you can only melt them down
and sell them for ingredients…

43
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,521
T-The armor moved!

44
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,273
It's a monster! Run!

45
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,777
We're no match for it. Run!

46
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,993
You…!

47
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,874
D-Dammit!

48
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,125
My sword…

49
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,470
Come on…!

50
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,563
I did it!

51
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,983
{\an8}-Laios!
-Huh?

52
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,489
<i>Something like that happened.</i>

53
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,075
And this is the sword I got then.

54
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,368
So you lost…

55
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,956
It was my first death, so for a while,
simply seeing an armor terrified me.

56
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:55,670
I read a lot of documents,
but none of them described how they taste.

57
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,339
I wonder what they taste like.

58
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,384
Senshi, how would you cook them?

59
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:04,512
Armor isn't edible.

60
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:09,017
Living Armor is simply controlled
by magic, and it's not some creature.

61
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,977
I-I know that, but…

62
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,979
What about the leather clasps?

63
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,440
{\an8}It's difficult to eat tanned hide,

64
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,277
{\an8}and it's far easier
to catch other monsters.

65
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,031
If you're that hungry for armor,
cook and eat your own.

66
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,117
I see.

67
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,661
I guess we can't eat Living Armor.

68
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,289
Come on, let's go.

69
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,003
{\an8}I'd rather not fight them now.

70
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,005
{\an8}How about running our way past them?

71
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,009
{\an8}They're slow,
so we could easily shake them off.

72
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,218
{\an8}True.

73
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,263
{\an8}Are you all okay with that?

74
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,389
{\an8}Sure.

75
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,892
We don't know
which set of armor might move.

76
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,393
Everyone, be careful.

77
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:53,394
Ready?

78
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,451
H-Here comes!

79
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,085
Run!

80
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,199
Our way is completely blocked!

81
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,700
What the heck?

82
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,578
{\an8}H-Hey! This is bad!

83
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,956
{\an8}Let's turn back for now and regroup!

84
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,083
{\an8}Pull back!

85
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,761
They're especially persistent today.

86
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,139
I wonder if something
put them in a bad mood.

87
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,098
No way!

88
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,435
{\an8}They don't have
physical conditions or feelings.

89
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:19,856
{\an8}That's why it should be easy if we can
defeat whoever is controlling them.

90
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,233
Are you sure there's someone?

91
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,484
I've never seen them.

92
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:26,237
USUALLY

93
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,699
<i>Usually, they only attack anyone
who gets close to them.</i>

94
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:33,494
<i>But today, they clearly blocked our path.</i>

95
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:39,292
<i>In other words, maybe they're
guarding something that's farther ahead.</i>

96
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,962
Whoever is controlling them is close by?

97
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,132
You're right. That might be possible.

98
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,926
{\an8}What? Is it a monster?

99
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,178
{\an8}I don't know.

100
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:53,806
{\an8}But a magic-user with such power
can't be anyone decent!

101
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:58,728
{\an8}Anyway, we have to find a way
to get past that barrier of armor and…

102
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,815
{\an8}So, if we can reach the magic-user
who is controlling the Living Armor,

103
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,735
we might be able to stop them.

104
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,278
But how?

105
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,404
For example…

106
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,115
Three of us act as bait
to draw their attention

107
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,493
while one of us goes past the door.

108
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,581
Good luck.

109
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,792
I thought you might be
the most fitting for the role

110
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,920
since you're good at going unnoticed.

111
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,922
I'm no good in combat.

112
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,258
Besides, Living Armor
doesn't have eyes or ears,

113
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,261
so going unnoticed doesn't help much
against something that's not alive.

114
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,014
Doesn't have eyes or ears…

115
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,063
Are you ready?

116
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:45,316
All right! Let's go!

117
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,817
Come on!

118
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,196
Gather around us, you sets of armor!

119
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,406
They're all coming!

120
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,699
Don't panic!

121
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:04,835
<i>Aslam!</i>

122
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,864
What? There's another Living Armor here?

123
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,289
<i>I've never seen this type of armor move.</i>

124
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,917
<i>I don't see anyone
who's controlling it, though.</i>

125
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,920
<i>It looks stronger
than the armor back there.</i>

126
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,134
<i>I can't call for backup, though.</i>

127
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:57,471
<i>Anyway, I have to figure out on my own
what they're guarding.</i>

128
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,479
<i>I'll cut off its arm or leg</i>

129
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,481
<i>and render it immobile!</i>

130
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,714
Dammit! You…!

131
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,267
<i>Why did it guard its shield?</i>

132
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,478
<i>What's that?</i>

133
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,732
<i>There's something on its shield.</i>

134
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,736
{\an8}<i>Somehow, it seems very familiar.</i>

135
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,744
<i>Right.</i>

136
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,874
<i>It's…</i>

137
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:14,131
<i>An egg case!</i>

138
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,842
<i>It's an egg of some creature.</i>

139
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,885
<i>That's what it shielded!</i>

140
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,057
<i>But what egg could it be?</i>

141
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,726
<i>Is it the egg of whoever
is controlling the armor?</i>

142
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,105
<i>Besides, Living Armor
doesn't have eyes or ears.</i>

143
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,314
<i>That's not it!</i>

144
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,899
<i>It's been bugging me all this time.</i>

145
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,485
<i>They're inorganic, without eyes or ears.</i>

146
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,738
<i>The way they pick up their head
and put it back on.</i>

147
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,325
<i>The way they turn their head
and follow our movements.</i>

148
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,828
<i>And the egg…</i>

149
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,706
<i>There's no doubt about it!
They're living creatures!</i>

150
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,668
<i>No one is giving them orders.</i>

151
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:55,548
<i>They're simply acting on their instincts
and trying to protect the egg.</i>

152
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,635
<i>In that case,
there are many ways to defeat them!</i>

153
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:01,929
<i>And…</i>

154
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,557
<i>they're edible!</i>

155
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,023
This is endless!

156
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,276
Are you serious?!

157
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,072
Don't pause! It's dangerous if you freeze!

158
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,407
Senshi! Behind you!

159
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,284
<i>Aslam!</i>

160
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,745
Huh? Hey!

161
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,252
Do they share parts?

162
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,170
What?!

163
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,796
Is that even possible?!

164
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,924
Hey, Laios!

165
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,760
Do something about these armors quickly!

166
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,265
<i>These Living Armors don't die
even when you cut off their heads.</i>

167
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,934
<i>But if they're creatures,
they must be killable.</i>

168
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:54,440
<i>Either by internal injury, outflow
of body fluid, suffocation, or starvation.</i>

169
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,359
<i>It's not realistic to try a method
that takes time.</i>

170
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:01,280
<i>First, I need to determine
the form of the creature that is inside.</i>

171
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:07,828
<i>For an amorphous creature like a Slime,
its movements are too rigid.</i>

172
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,208
<i>Is it possible that they're swarms
of tiny creatures?</i>

173
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,627
<i>But they don't make any sound,
so that seems unlikely.</i>

174
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:18,964
<i>Or maybe creatures with long limbs
are controlling them from inside.</i>

175
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,884
<i>They could be other creatures,</i>

176
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,387
<i>but it's probably easier
to see for myself.</i>

177
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,015
<i>It doesn't seem like
I can match it in strength.</i>

178
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,725
<i>In that case,</i>

179
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,727
<i>I only have one option!</i>

180
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,772
<i>Go for the shield with the egg attached,
and make it drop its guard!</i>

181
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,243
Got it!

182
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,871
What's inside? Huh?

183
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,123
There's nothing!

184
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,710
It's empty.

185
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,130
Could it have been a camouflage tactic
when it retrieved its head?

186
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,633
<i>This is bad.</i>

187
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,885
{\an8}I need… I need to think of my next move!

188
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,515
What?

189
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:13,394
<i>Couldn't it see which pillar I hid behind?</i>

190
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,230
<i>There must be something in its head, then.</i>

191
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:18,607
A gap?

192
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,579
I see. It was a mollusk!

193
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:33,789
It was clinging to the inside.

194
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,125
<i>Could it have survived amputation</i>

195
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,669
<i>because it was a colony
of many creatures to begin with?</i>

196
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,422
<i>Is it looking for its head?</i>

197
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,966
<i>Maybe in its current state…</i>

198
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,319
Hmm, how interesting!

199
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,945
Just how many are there?

200
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,782
They mimic muscle movements

201
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,660
by expanding
and contracting at the joints.

202
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,746
I wonder if they're hermaphrodites.

203
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,790
I wonder which creature laid the egg.

204
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,836
I forgot I don't have time
for this right now!

205
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,339
Excuse me!

206
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,216
You…! Just let go!

207
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,344
Everyone! Come over here now!

208
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,720
-Now's not the time!
-Now's not the time!

209
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,684
Huh?

210
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,692
What was that? How did you do that?!

211
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,571
So there was a magic-user?!

212
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,740
There were no magic-users.

213
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,826
The Living Armors weren't controlled.

214
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,286
They were creatures.

215
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,704
Huh?

216
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,040
Look at the inside of this armor.

217
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,542
There are two layers,
and something is clinging between them.

218
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,712
This is the identity of the Living Armor.

219
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,969
<i>By clasping hands inside the armor,</i>

220
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,805
<i>they were acting
as muscles of different parts.</i>

221
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,849
Even though each creature is weak,

222
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,727
by dividing the body parts
and utilizing the armor's structure,

223
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,480
they can imitate human movements.

224
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,108
Unluckily for us,

225
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,860
it seems we encountered them
during the spawning season this time.

226
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,114
Spawning?! These things hatch from eggs?!

227
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:33,367
That's right! They hatch from eggs!

228
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,577
{\an8}No one realized this until now!

229
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,914
{\an8}Everyone thought they were simply
Living Armor controlled by magic!

230
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,292
{\an8}If I were to reveal this fact,
it would cause a huge stir in our circle!

231
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,879
You know how he talks fast

232
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,131
when it comes to monsters?

233
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,507
It creeps me out.

234
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,384
Hush! Stop that.

235
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:51,635
Senshi!

236
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,888
We might not be able to eat armor,
but what about the stuff inside?

237
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,307
Looks pretty nutritious, doesn't it?

238
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:04,148
There's no way we can eat something
so mysterious!

239
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,275
Now, now, Marcille.

240
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,820
Every food is a mystery
until that first bite.

241
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,699
{\an8}Now's not the time to be trying it!

242
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,950
Let's give it a shot.

243
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,328
I'm using this ingredient
for the first time,

244
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,830
so I'm not confident, though.

245
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,457
Thanks, Senshi.

246
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,916
No way!

247
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,502
What if it's extremely poisonous?

248
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:30,841
I doubt a creature with potent poison
would hide itself inside a shell.

249
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,303
But how should I cook it?

250
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:36,221
This underside…

251
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,016
didn't budge when I tried
to pry it open with my hands.

252
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,353
But when I cut this part with a blade,
it couldn't close the gap.

253
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:46,690
Maybe it was an adductor muscle
that it uses to close the gap,

254
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,525
like a scallop.

255
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,861
I see. So it's a shellfish.

256
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,863
All right, I've decided.

257
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,532
Pry the meat from the armor, will you?

258
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,542
It drowned.

259
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:08,378
I guess you can't purge
the sand with water.

260
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:11,882
I don't know if they even need
to be purged of sand.

261
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,718
I'm a bit worried
about their internal organs,

262
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,386
so I'll remove them.

263
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,015
The sliced meat will go inside a soup.

264
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:25,562
Oil, meat from the Living Armor,
herbs, and seasoning.

265
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:30,317
And the head…

266
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,403
will be steamed.

267
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,157
And finally,
we might as well make the classic dish.

268
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,249
It's ready!

269
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,167
DWARF-STYLE LIVING ARMOR STIR-FRY
LIVING ARMOR SOUP

270
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,170
GRILLED LIVING ARMOR

271
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,173
{\an8}STEAM-BAKED LIVING ARMOR

272
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,592
Marcille, which do you want to have first?

273
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,593
What?

274
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,595
I-I'll have the soup, then…

275
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,599
Wait, do antidotes
work against food poisoning as well?

276
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,685
It doesn't smell bad.

277
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,229
It smells faintly of iron.

278
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:08,939
Laios,

279
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:09,857
here.

280
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,817
It's hot!

281
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,282
Why are you all looking at me like that?

282
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,286
{\an8}You've been craving Living Armor
for a long time now, right?

283
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,955
{\an8}We shouldn't eat it before you do.

284
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,582
I see…

285
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,584
If he dies, let's leave him here.

286
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,710
Yeah.

287
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,258
-<i>Did he die?</i>
-<i>Did he die?</i>

288
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,801
It's delicious!

289
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:41,346
What on earth? It's so delicious!

290
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:45,392
At first, it tasted bland,
but the flavor kicks in later!

291
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,270
How long does it take before you
start having symptoms of food poisoning?

292
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,646
It depends on the food.

293
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,736
So that's what it tastes like.

294
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,989
Not bad, but I think
I could've cooked it better.

295
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,365
How about the dish you have?

296
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,663
Well, I suppose this one should be safe
because it was stir-fried with herbs.

297
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:12,377
H-How is it?

298
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,546
It's not bad.

299
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,810
What do you think, Marcille?

300
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,231
It tastes a bit like mushrooms.

301
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,273
Right?

302
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,652
The steam-baked one
looks ready and tasty, too.

303
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:39,404
It has to taste great!

304
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,034
It tastes like mold.

305
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,745
The odor of the helmet
must've gotten trapped in it.

306
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,416
Here.

307
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,462
You know, I've been in the dungeon
for a long time now,

308
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,090
but I never thought they were edible.

309
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,219
{\an8}Nobody would expect Living Armor
to be a sort of shellfish

310
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,429
{\an8}that hatch from eggs.

311
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,100
Maybe when they're newborns
and juveniles, they're very small,

312
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,686
and no one suspects them
to be Living Armor.

313
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,689
<i>They probably form shells as they grow.</i>

314
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,190
<i>Then, they start forming colonies.</i>

315
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,819
<i>And when they can move,
they travel looking for other colonies.</i>

316
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:22,823
<i>Maybe the armor standing in rows
were looking for partners.</i>

317
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:27,661
<i>They are likely hermaphrodites
and the biggest colony lays an egg.</i>

318
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,831
<i>Oh! That means…</i>

319
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,624
The armor I occasionally see holding hands

320
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,501
might not have been
adventurers fooling around.

321
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,420
Maybe they were actually mating!

322
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,838
You can drop it now.

323
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,466
<i>To think the thing
I was so scared of for a time</i>

324
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,220
<i>was such a tasty and feeble monster.</i>

325
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,598
Your sword broke, huh?

326
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,976
Why don't you take that one?

327
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,064
Laios!

328
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,152
{\an8}If you're going to use that sword,
shall I test it to see if it's not cursed?

329
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,820
No need!

330
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,405
I'm absolutely sure it's not cursed!

331
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,698
I can tell!

332
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,283
You seem awfully confident.

333
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,411
Don't come to me if you end up
with some weird curse.

334
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:13,707
Everyone, wait for me!

335
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,252
<i>Armed with a new sword,</i>

336
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,629
<i>their journey continues.</i>

337
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:24,843
<i>The other three had no way of knowing</i>

338
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:27,804
<i>that they had a new companion.</i>

339
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,981
