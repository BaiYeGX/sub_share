1
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,927
<i>On the third basement floor
of the dungeon,</i>

3
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,055
<i>through the underground graveyard
and past the forest of the spire,</i>

4
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,849
<i>you reach the Golden Castle.</i>

5
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,311
<i>The once splendid castle</i>

6
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,523
<i>is now covered in mold and dust
and is a shadow of what it used to be.</i>

7
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,859
<i>The footsteps that come
as if from nowhere,</i>

8
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,986
<i>could they belong to an adventurer?</i>

9
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,405
<i>Or could they belong to a former resident
who has passed away</i>

10
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,157
<i>but is still wandering around?</i>

11
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,244
That's a Skeleton.

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,373
And they're humans.

13
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,877
That's a ghoul.

14
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:10,130
How can you tell? You're creeping me out!

15
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,632
The footsteps of a living creature,
bones, and something rotten

16
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,883
are totally different.

17
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,181
Let's go left.

18
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,433
The Golem is guarding the right passage.

19
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:28,690
<i>A Golem is a human-shaped magical creature
made of mud, dirt, and stone.</i>

20
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,818
<i>It is used as a puppet
that faithfully follows</i>

21
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,278
<i>its master's commands.</i>

22
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,362
Stop.

23
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,700
For your information, Golems are 99% dirt!

24
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,076
They aren't edible!

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,161
They are genuinely magical creatures!

26
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:44,038
I even know how to make them!

27
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,915
-Teach me!
-No!

28
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,793
{\an8}What do you want to use them for
after you learn how to make them?

29
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:52,547
What I'm interested in is their bodies.

30
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,882
Follow me.

31
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:00,555
This is the campsite
I usually use as my base.

32
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,475
You live here?

33
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,769
I hardly sleep here.

34
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,356
I usually hunt
on the second or fourth floor,

35
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,944
and once a month, I shop for seasoning
and other things I lack in town.

36
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,740
<i>It was on my way back
from a shopping trip that I met you folks.</i>

37
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,493
There are only a few monsters
you can eat on the third floor.

38
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,706
They are mostly decayed or just bones.

39
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:27,957
But…

40
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,709
<i>Golems!</i>

41
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,670
<i>Those wonderful creatures are different!</i>

42
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:35,715
<i>Their bodies are high in nutrition</i>

43
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,302
and always maintain
the appropriate temperature and humidity.

44
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,430
In other words,

45
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,099
you are using Golems as a garden?

46
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,768
The people in this castle will weep!

47
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,686
And so will the scholars of magic!

48
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,188
Why?

49
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:54,275
I don't like magic,
but those creatures deserve praise.

50
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,945
All gardens should be like that!

51
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,948
<i>After all, they're resistant
to harmful insects.</i>

52
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,992
<i>And they drive away vegetable thieves.</i>

53
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,953
<i>I don't think
they're after the vegetables.</i>

54
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,456
<i>What's more,
they even control moisture levels.</i>

55
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,541
<i>If you plant seeds and seedlings in them,</i>

56
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:13,211
<i>they'll take care
of the rest of the cultivation.</i>

57
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:17,006
That said,
you still have to tend them carefully.

58
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,717
That's why I have my base here.

59
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:36,818
Here they come!

60
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,820
What now?

61
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,154
-Need our help?
-No need!

62
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,425
Wow.

63
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,801
He's used to this.

64
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:05,722
How does he know
where the Golem's core is located?

65
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,640
Don't tell me…

66
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,225
It's done.

67
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,854
Harvest the vegetables from the Golems.

68
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:17,275
I thought they were covered in green,
but are these all vegetables?

69
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,486
From a Golem's perspective,
aren't they like parasites?

70
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,950
On the contrary,
the plants' roots make the soil firmer,

71
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,161
so you could say
they're in a symbiotic relationship.

72
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,704
Are you sure?

73
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:32,123
But please remove the weeds.

74
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,174
What a rich harvest!

75
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,635
Looks like we can finally enjoy
some normal vegetables!

76
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,929
Bring the weeds over here.

77
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,849
Stack them up in this spot
and they will wither.

78
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:50,933
Once they're withered,

79
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,770
I'll return them to the Golems' bodies,
and they'll naturally decompose.

80
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:59,067
And this is fertilizer I made elsewhere.

81
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,694
I mix this into the Golems!

82
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,820
I knew it!

83
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,197
You knew what?

84
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,576
{\an8}You knew where the Golems' cores were
because you're the one who planted them!

85
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,453
Unbelievable.

86
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,331
It's illegal to activate
a magical creature without permission!

87
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:18,336
{\an8}All I'm doing is digging up dirt
and putting it back.

88
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,921
{\an8}So, you're bypassing the law!

89
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,341
<i>Stir the soil well and make raised rows.</i>

90
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:26,928
<i>Planting the same crop repeatedly
leads to monocropping issues,</i>

91
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,347
<i>so sow the seeds in a different Golem.</i>

92
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,351
I'm exhausted.

93
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:37,063
I feel like I used more stamina
than when fighting monsters.

94
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,691
Thanks to your help,
it got done much quicker.

95
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,528
Drinking water
made me want to use the bathroom.

96
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:48,866
Well then, while that elven girl is gone,

97
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,120
I'll gather up the scattered soil
as much as I can.

98
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:02,004
Taro, Jiro, Saburo.

99
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,007
Will burying those
make them revive quickly?

100
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,010
No, it takes some time.

101
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,930
<i>They'll revive
just when the seeds begin to take root,</i>

102
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,433
<i>and the soil stays in place
even when they move around.</i>

103
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:19,772
He treats the Golems with so much care.

104
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,941
I'm impressed.

105
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,901
So this is how you were living.

106
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,778
Wasn't it tough?

107
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,073
I do it because I like it.

108
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,825
It's not tough at all.

109
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,913
That's about it.

110
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:39,333
Now, let's enjoy the fruits of our labor!

111
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,547
What a beautiful color.

112
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,550
I've sure gotten better at peeling.

113
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,346
Is this size really okay?

114
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,681
It's perfect.

115
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,102
Are you making a fire?
I can do it for you.

116
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,062
I'll strike a flint, so it's fine.

117
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,942
You always make a fire like that,
but using magic is faster.

118
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:08,070
You were just singing the praises
of how convenient Golems are.

119
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,325
When you make something easier,
you may lose your edge in a skill.

120
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,619
Convenience and ease
aren't the same thing.

121
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:19,081
Your method is no different
from buying vegetables from the store.

122
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,674
This is the last of the Basilisk bacon.

123
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,430
It's done.

124
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:37,099
FRESH VEGETABLE LUNCH
FROM THE GOLEM GARDEN

125
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,101
-Let's dig in!
-Let's dig in!

126
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,485
It's so good!

127
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,363
It's odd to think such tasty vegetables
can grow underground!

128
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,366
I wonder if something inside the Golems
is affecting the flavor.

129
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,450
Stop it!

130
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,286
I don't care if they walk or yell.
They're gardens!

131
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,624
Speaking of which,
Golems are 99% soil, right?

132
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,626
What's the last 1%?

133
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,628
It's a secret.

134
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,924
Phew, that was delicious.

135
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,759
I'm so full.

136
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,136
I'm feeling sleepy after eating so much.

137
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,597
You can rest.

138
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,225
There's a little something
I want to take care of.

139
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,311
Clean up!

140
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,646
I'm going to the toilet.

141
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,775
The toilets around here are so proper.

142
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,903
They aren't some random holes
dug in the ground.

143
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,365
<i>In busy areas of the dungeon,</i>

144
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,909
<i>there are designated spots
for people to relieve themselves.</i>

145
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,620
{\an8}They're always kept clean,

146
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,164
{\an8}and sometimes
they're even decorated with flowers.

147
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,417
There must be some diligent people here.

148
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,169
Hm?

149
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,921
Senshi!

150
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,132
What is it?

151
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,300
What are you doing?

152
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:57,013
I'm collecting the feces and urine
and carrying them to the chamber pots.

153
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,432
I'm impressed you can do that
right after a meal.

154
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,476
They serve as crucial fertilizers
down here.

155
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,562
You mean they were also used
for the vegetables…

156
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,899
{\an8}Marcille, they do the same thing
on the surface, too.

157
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,152
{\an8}I know that, but it's still gross.

158
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:16,073
Why are you so determined
to stick to your life in the dungeon?

159
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,577
If you want a self-sufficient life,
you could have it above ground as well.

160
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:24,540
Don't you think it'd be easier
to cultivate a garden outside and hunt?

161
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:29,253
Then who else will maintain
the toilets in the dungeon?

162
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:33,883
Who will remove the zombies
that fall inside the toilets?

163
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:36,802
Who will help up the fallen Golems?

164
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:41,849
There used to be over ten Golems,
but now there are only three.

165
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,435
<i>Without Golems,</i>

166
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,229
<i>monsters from the lower levels
will climb up here.</i>

167
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,651
<i>And the monsters driven out
by those monsters will enter other places.</i>

168
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,944
<i>And they will drive out other monsters.</i>

169
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,616
<i>If that happens,
this dungeon will be a different place.</i>

170
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,993
<i>You wouldn't be able
to stroll or hunt in here.</i>

171
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,455
The dungeon is just like a garden.

172
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,376
You can't abandon them
and expect to reap their rewards.

173
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,710
More than anything,

174
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:14,799
<i>eating the things that grow here
and giving back to the dungeon…</i>

175
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:20,971
<i>Living like this, I finally feel like
I've truly entered this dungeon.</i>

176
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,432
And that makes me happy.

177
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,978
But if that's the case,

178
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,190
is it okay for you
to leave this place on our behalf?

179
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,609
If this place falls into chaos…

180
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:35,319
Don't worry about it.

181
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:40,282
Even if I'm away for a month or two,
the Golems will take care of things.

182
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:45,037
Besides, I wouldn't rest easy at night
if you all died from malnutrition.

183
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,038
Give me a minute.

184
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,748
I'll get ready in a hurry.

185
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,881
Senshi is so amazing.

186
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,470
What are you going to do
with these vegetables?

187
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:05,015
I usually use them for bartering.

188
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,018
Sometimes I set up
an unmanned booth and sell them.

189
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,854
<i>An unmanned booth?</i>

190
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,274
<i>I used to collect the money
in a treasure box,</i>

191
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,610
but I stopped
because they kept getting stolen.

192
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,404
<i>So that's why that treasure box…</i>

193
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,114
<i>…Always had money in it.</i>

194
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:24,034
So, do you do your bartering around here?

195
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,913
I have customers on a lower floor,

196
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:30,332
but even if we go now,
they probably won't have time for us.

197
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,127
I didn't want to leave
the garden lying idle,

198
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,295
so I harvested the crops.

199
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,338
But you can throw them away
if you don't need them.

200
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:39,175
You can't do that!
You shouldn't waste food!

201
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:43,929
You worked so hard to cultivate them,
and they're so glossy and delicious!

202
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,264
You're growing attached to them.

203
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:50,936
Well, in that case,
we really should trade them around here.

204
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,064
-<i>Around here, huh?</i>
-<i>Around here, huh?</i>

205
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,943
<i>There are merchants
even inside the dungeon.</i>

206
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,324
Enter.

207
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:10,122
<i>Many of their customers are adventurers</i>

208
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,542
<i>or people who, for reasons,
can't go back above ground.</i>

209
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,298
Welcome, my dear guests.

210
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,884
Are you looking for a place to stay
or something to eat?

211
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,260
We want to trade.

212
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,845
Well, well.

213
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,932
So, what do you have?

214
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,308
Vegetables.

215
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,103
Go away, go away!

216
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,563
Wait, at least listen to…

217
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,941
{\an8}If you want to trade, bring coins!

218
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,693
{\an8}Do you understand? Coins!

219
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,570
{\an8}The round, shiny, and glittery things!

220
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,573
It's not like we want
to trade them for gems.

221
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,325
You have a kitchen here, don't you?

222
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,326
You need ingredients…

223
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,328
These are round and shiny, too.

224
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,331
Show this carrot to your cook.

225
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,707
I'm sure they'll want to use it.

226
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,418
Who would eat something so disgusting?!

227
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,796
How awful!

228
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,550
{\an8}You'll incur divine punishment
if you waste food!

229
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,178
Throw them out now!

230
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,180
{\an8}-Quickly now!
-Listen to--

231
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,058
Huh?

232
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,314
Orcs!

233
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,276
Kill the ones with weapons first!

234
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:22,319
Don't leave even one alive!

235
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,326
Why are orcs here?

236
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,704
I thought they were on much lower floors.

237
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,664
Anyway, we have to run…

238
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,712
-Marcille!
-Wait.

239
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:49,263
What are you doing here, Senshi?

240
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,017
That's what I want to ask as well.

241
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,063
Are these folks your acquaintances?

242
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,064
That's right.

243
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,860
To think you would associate
with humans and an elf.

244
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,154
By customers, did you mean…

245
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,906
I meant them.

246
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:12,453
I figured he meant folks like them,
but orcs, huh?

247
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,038
I thought they'd be goblins at least.

248
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,332
I assumed he meant Kobolds.

249
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,584
{\an8}The Red Dragon showed up.

250
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:24,256
<i>The Red Dragon
that rarely appeared in the past.</i>

251
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,219
{\an8}But lately, it's been showing up
near our settlement.

252
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,847
{\an8}There are some who can't fight
in our settlement.

253
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:36,226
{\an8}We came to this floor
for temporary refuge.

254
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,646
The Red Dragon, could it be?

255
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,773
The Dragon, where did you see it?

256
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,235
Are you asking me
to tell you where our settlement is?

257
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,153
I refuse.

258
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,906
Boss, we dealt with everyone inside.

259
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:49,949
Good.

260
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,159
Carry out everything that might be useful.

261
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,036
What on earth?

262
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,664
Rotten milk?

263
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,207
Throw it away.

264
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,168
Those are crops you cultivated, right?

265
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,546
As you can see, we're in need right now.

266
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,548
I'd like you to share that with me.

267
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,634
For barter?

268
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,010
In that case, these are…

269
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:10,928
No.

270
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,471
As I said,

271
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,516
we can't afford that right now.

272
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:19,979
It pains me to ask this of a friend,

273
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,440
but I want you to give us
all the stuff you have there.

274
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,610
S-Senshi.

275
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,696
Very well.

276
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,239
Good.

277
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:33,450
But in exchange,
I have a favor to ask you.

278
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,787
Tonight, let us stay at your place.

279
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,705
-Huh?
-Huh?

280
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,665
If you will grant us that,

281
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:42,751
we will gladly offer our lives
or our vegetables.

282
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:43,669
Huh?

283
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,129
And you there!

284
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:47,464
That isn't rotten, it's fermented!

285
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,299
Be sure to take it with you!

286
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,305
Why did you say that?

287
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,057
They took our weapons.

288
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:59,518
If we learn the location
of their campsite,

289
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,353
we'll never see the light of day again.

290
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:04,398
You do have a plan, right?

291
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:09,987
The jar I told an orc to take earlier

292
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,573
is leaven made of yeast.

293
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:17,828
And the orcs have the flour
that was in the kitchen.

294
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,996
In other words…

295
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,997
In other words?

296
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,833
I can make bread!

297
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,544
-Moron!
-So you don't have a plan!

298
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,088
-Moron!
-You just wanted to make bread!

299
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,298
Moron!

300
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,133
Hey, there! Be quiet!

301
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,679
It's an elf!

302
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,639
What a barbaric face.

303
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,808
Stay inside this cage.

304
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,144
Dad came back!

305
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,398
We better not end up
becoming their meal for today.

306
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,109
Where did you put the leaven?!

307
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:53,572
If you don't know how to use it,
you're sitting on a gold mine!

308
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,033
Give it to me! I'll make you bread!

309
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,911
Bread!

310
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,250
Mix together strong wheat flour,
salt, sugar, leaven, and water.

311
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,670
And knead it until it comes together.

312
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,173
Are you playing with mud?

313
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,174
Huh?

314
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,552
How about a history lesson?

315
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,848
This is a story about a time
when we were still living above ground

316
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,558
instead of under the ground.

317
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,728
People like that elf and humans there

318
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,732
killed many of our people
and took our lands.

319
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,528
Orcs killed a lot of other races, too.

320
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,445
What?

321
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,447
Now, you add olive oil.

322
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,577
We were forced to leave the surface
and after wandering for a while,

323
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,957
we found our place underground,
and we had peace for a while.

324
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,793
Until they found us again.

325
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:51,964
Hold the edge of the dough
and knead it by punching it down.

326
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,926
They poured oil into the underground
and set fire to it.

327
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:00,639
That's because you orcs kept raiding
the villages of other races over and over!

328
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,809
It was the only way for us to survive.

329
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:07,187
That was your way of life
even before you moved underground.

330
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,730
That's why you were driven out!

331
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:11,483
Stop it, Marcille. That's enough--

332
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,277
Shut up, half-foot!

333
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,696
Knead it with more strength, will you?!

334
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,738
Sorry.

335
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,991
Give it to me! I'll do it!

336
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,451
We were driven from the surface
and fled underground.

337
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,579
And when we finally
arrived at the dungeon,

338
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,873
you folks tried to take it from us!

339
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,418
It was the villagers
above ground who found it first!

340
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,254
{\an8}But we went into the depths first!

341
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,048
{\an8}Then the zombies roaming around
were there before anyone else!

342
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,385
Once the dough stretches smoothly,
it's time for the first fermentation.

343
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:46,810
When the dough doubles in size,
divide it evenly and shape it neatly.

344
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,479
You've been silent
this whole time, tall-man.

345
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,065
But what are you thinking?

346
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,403
<i>They say anyone who defeats
the lunatic magician who built this place</i>

347
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:59,448
<i>will gain this whole castle.</i>

348
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,659
Why are you trying
to go to the depths of the dungeon?

349
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,539
{\an8}When you gain the kingdom,
what will you do?

350
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:13,921
I've heard of that story,
but I've never thought of that.

351
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,881
What a joke.

352
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,550
All adventurers are like you.

353
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,678
You make your daily wage
and you test your skills.

354
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,931
You're all just greedy fools.

355
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,351
I shudder to think what might happen
if someone like you

356
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,061
ends up getting this castle.

357
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,732
{\an8}That's why we kill anyone
from the surface we can find.

358
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,359
What a poor excuse!

359
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:38,028
Then you should compete
for the throne as well.

360
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,781
Or is plundering
the only thing orcs can do?

361
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,283
At least you have spunk.

362
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,785
I like that.

363
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,454
{\an8}I'll throw you into the fire alive!

364
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,873
{\an8}See? You turn to violence so quickly!

365
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,625
Second fermentation.

366
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,381
Once it has expanded enough,

367
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,384
cook it on low heat one side at a time.

368
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,636
Let it steam a little,

369
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,888
and open the lid.

370
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,475
And the bread is done!

371
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,936
It smells so good!

372
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:12,604
Let's have a taste.

373
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,983
Stop! That bread is ours.

374
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:17,901
We won't give it to you.

375
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:18,902
What?

376
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,738
I let you make bread
because you wanted to,

377
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,700
but what we do with it is up to us.

378
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:27,828
Dad.

379
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:32,582
These people made it together,
but they don't get to eat it?

380
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,131
That's because bread alone
won't make a meal.

381
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:45,095
You need a staple food, meat,
and vegetables for a well-balanced meal.

382
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:49,182
Your father just wanted us to wait
until the other dishes were ready.

383
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,600
Hey! What are you saying?!

384
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:53,895
Exactly. He promised
to provide lodging for a night

385
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,772
in exchange for our vegetables.

386
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,568
And your father is someone
who can't break promises.

387
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,200
Hey! Make them some random food!

388
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,208
FRESHLY PICKED STEWED CABBAGE

389
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,127
Here! It's ready!

390
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,337
-Eat!
-Okay.

391
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,422
Thank you.

392
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,681
I-It's good!

393
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,224
So spicy!

394
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,810
It's spicy and delicious!

395
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,730
It's made with the same ingredients
as Senshi's stewed cabbage,

396
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,982
but it's a completely different dish.

397
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,652
I said plundering
was the only thing you could do,

398
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,196
but orcs can be pretty decent, too.

399
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,156
Shut up.

400
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,366
Um…

401
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,245
You asked me why I was trying
to reach the depths of the dungeon.

402
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:55,290
You see, my sister
was eaten by the Red Dragon.

403
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,667
That's why I'm going after the Dragon.

404
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,881
If you will tell us where it is,
we'll defeat the Red Dragon.

405
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,259
We won't involve your settlement at all.

406
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,599
I promise.

407
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,815
Hey, bring me a map.

408
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,732
Got it.

409
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,819
It's two floors under this one.

410
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,321
Last time I saw it, it was around
the west residential area.

411
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,281
Thank you.

412
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,957
From now on,
I'll think about the possibility

413
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,126
of gaining this dungeon as I explore it.

414
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,088
It's tough to imagine a guy
who gets captured by an orc

415
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,965
and bakes bread will become a king.

416
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,385
{\an8}But good luck.

417
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,012
It tastes really good.

418
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,937
You know, that cabbage
was grown on the back of a Golem.

419
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,653
<i>Even though people have varying views,
they all experience hunger.</i>

420
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:14,161
<i>It may only be dungeon food,
but it's still dungeon food.</i>

421
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,919
