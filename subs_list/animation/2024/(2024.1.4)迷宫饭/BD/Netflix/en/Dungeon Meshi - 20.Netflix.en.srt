1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:33,968
I don't recognize this road.

3
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,512
This <i>is</i> the way.

4
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,805
Are you sure?

5
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:41,059
Pick up the pace! Get a move on!

6
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,227
I think we're stuck.

7
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,603
Don't push!

8
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,230
-Hey!
-Watch out--

9
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:53,071
This open space
is where we fought the Red Dragon!

10
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,952
You made it all the way here
on your last expedition?

11
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,578
Yeah.

12
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,832
For a long time, this spot
was believed to be the deepest point.

13
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:08,044
But recently, they found a door nearby
that seems to go even deeper.

14
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,840
It's engraved with a design,
and they think it opens with magic.

15
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:15,844
<i>We came to sketch the design
for the Lord of the Island, but…</i>

16
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,392
<i>You encountered the Red Dragon
and were forced to retreat.</i>

17
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,687
All right, let's try our luck.

18
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,064
I think we were over there last time.

19
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,068
I found our gear!

20
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,862
It's been ransacked.

21
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,071
No!

22
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,324
{\an8}Yes!

23
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,993
I found my sleeping bag!

24
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:42,453
Great. My underwear's still here too.

25
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,039
Those are things you prioritize
over your valuables?

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,209
All our food is gone,

27
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,295
but everything else seems untouched.

28
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,171
Guess it was monsters that did this.

29
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,548
I'm so glad.

30
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,675
Now I can sleep warm tonight--

31
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:00,763
That's not good.

32
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,057
Let's find a place to rest for a bit.

33
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,559
I want to organize my gear too.

34
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:08,104
Maybe the snow slows down the Cleaners.

35
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,231
They've gotten at my soap.

36
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,274
Hey, none of that.

37
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,401
Show me whatever you just stashed away.

38
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,156
Here, Marcille.

39
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,240
Ow.

40
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:22,076
Talk about an untrained beast-man.

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,746
No wonder they slapped that collar on you.

42
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,166
You're called a half-foot, right?

43
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,960
I've never seen your kind in the East.

44
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,087
I had to come here
to learn about you folks.

45
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,132
{\an8}That odd name for your race.

46
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:41,012
{\an8}I heard it's because lots of you
got a foot lopped off for stealing.

47
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:45,016
Come on, you two, cut it out.

48
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,018
Marcille!

49
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,269
Come here!

50
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,941
It's a fish!

51
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,527
Is there a way to cut out
just this section?

52
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,781
Maybe with a magic circle…

53
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,825
Right. Want to give it a shot, Laios?

54
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,869
I'll show you how to draw a magic circle.

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,747
How's your mana sickness been lately?

56
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,582
I don't get so dizzy anymore.

57
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,253
<i>The hallucinations
are getting stronger, though.</i>

58
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,673
{\an8}<i>It's fish I used to catch
on the fourth floor.</i>

59
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,178
<i>The water from the upper floors
has flowed down here and froze.</i>

60
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,932
<i>Looks like all sorts of stuff
end up in the stream.</i>

61
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,435
And now the circle's ready.

62
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,271
{\an8}How do you feel?

63
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,939
{\an8}A little tired.

64
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,066
I'll activate it then.

65
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,487
Imagine it as pouring water
into the symbols you've etched.

66
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,325
What on earth?

67
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,952
The ground, it's…

68
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,207
A-A monster?

69
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,834
An Ice Golem?

70
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,339
<i>I see.</i>

71
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,097
Hey! Above you!

72
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,098
Watch out!

73
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,436
Laios!

74
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,908
So how do we take this thing down?

75
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,578
The only way to stop Golems
is by breaking their core!

76
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,704
{\an8}Their core?

77
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,830
{\an8}And where do I find that?

78
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,840
Hey! Where's the core?

79
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,508
Hang on a second!

80
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,802
<i>Is that its core? No, it's just a fish.</i>

81
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,929
<i>There's too much junk in there to tell.</i>

82
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:50,058
Hey! Keep that thing distracted
and buy me some time!

83
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:51,309
I can't spot the core yet!

84
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,435
Huh?!

85
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:57,315
<i>That jerk better not be making stuff up
to bring me down.</i>

86
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,114
{\an8}The snow!

87
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,251
<i>It stopped.</i>

88
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,473
Hey, you done yet?

89
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,183
How much longer do I have to keep this up?

90
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,935
That's good, Izutsumi. Well done!

91
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,068
Good. Perfect!

92
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,821
You better not be messing around!

93
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,323
No, idiot. Check where my arrow landed.

94
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,455
Also, I can use projectiles,

95
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,416
but I can't do much damage with them.

96
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,961
So don't count on me in a battle!

97
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,295
I'll let you handle the rest!

98
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,008
<i>Oh, well.</i>

99
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,386
<i>Now that I know how to take it down…</i>

100
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:37,165
{\an8}Seems like I'm the only one here
who's actually useful.

101
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,500
The rest of you are just…

102
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,718
Is everyone okay?

103
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,636
It'll warm up soon.

104
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,432
That magic circle can get pretty hot,
so watch out for burns.

105
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,351
Take off your wet clothes
and dry them out.

106
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,394
You too.

107
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,646
{\an8}I'll give you some cover.

108
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,982
Laios, can you change on your own?

109
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,486
Someone lend him a hand.

110
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,406
No need to shield me.

111
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,408
{\an8}But you can't just…

112
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,962
It's not like anyone would be excited
to see a beast get naked.

113
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:26,797
What's the big idea?

114
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,592
{\an8}I just didn't want you catching a chill.

115
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,803
At least let me count her nipples,
or see the base of her tail!

116
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,894
It's starting to get warm.

117
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,605
Let's prepare something hot.

118
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,525
We've got to thaw this out.

119
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,653
Maybe I can melt it over the magic circle.

120
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,907
Too close.

121
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,909
This is nice, though.

122
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,035
It feels like a sauna.

123
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,788
It's been ages since we had a bath.

124
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,373
Let's sweat it out!

125
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,171
That thing comes off?

126
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,548
Why am I blindfolded?

127
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,426
<i>I'll clean the fish, then use the head
and bones to brew up some broth.</i>

128
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,929
We might end up smelling like fish.

129
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,432
<i>Thinly slice the mushrooms and Nightmares.</i>

130
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,186
<i>Give the Shapeshifter meat a quick boil
to skim off any scum.</i>

131
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,522
<i>Whisk the Harpy egg,</i>

132
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,775
<i>then mix it in with the broth
and other ingredients.</i>

133
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,947
<i>Pour it all into cups,</i>

134
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,200
<i>set them in a pot
with the Ice Golem fragments,</i>

135
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,243
<i>and heat it up.</i>

136
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,204
Look. I made this out of her shed hair.

137
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,205
How bored are you?

138
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,584
Finally, garnish with Mandrake leaves.

139
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:45,876
And it's done--

140
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,378
Hey!

141
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,797
You can't just start eating on your own.

142
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,383
Wait until everyone is at the table.

143
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,551
Why not?

144
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,095
I took down the enemy all by myself!

145
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,639
I deserve to eat first!

146
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,642
Meals begin when everyone's present.

147
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:05,229
Chilchuck, Laios went outside.
Can you go fetch him?

148
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,147
Got it.

149
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,150
This feels great.

150
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,651
Is this guy for real?

151
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,820
ICE GOLEM SAVORY EGG CUSTARD

152
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,655
AND COOKED FISH
TAKEN FROM THE ICE GOLEM

153
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,908
All right, now that we're all here,

154
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,619
let's start eating!

155
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:20,911
-Let's dig in.
-Let's dig in.

156
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,414
It's pudding.

157
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,083
Sorry, Marcille.

158
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,293
Yum!

159
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,629
<i>What a waste of time.</i>

160
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,796
Hey, Izutsumi.

161
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,465
What is it?

162
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,674
This is for you.

163
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,385
I patched up a torn bag.

164
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,511
You can use it.

165
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,432
Listen.

166
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,976
{\an8}I apologize for calling you a beast.

167
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,270
{\an8}I've got a sharp tongue.

168
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,482
Traveling together
with a bunch of strangers

169
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,109
can feel suffocating
and annoying at first.

170
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,654
But once you get used to it,
there are perks.

171
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,823
You can get others
to handle stuff you can't.

172
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,376
{\an8}-That was delicious.
-That was delicious.

173
00:11:09,668 --> 00:11:10,503
{\an8}Yeah.

174
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,840
Hey, are you done yet?

175
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,801
Just a little longer.

176
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,220
Like this and that…

177
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,471
There we go!

178
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:23,140
Ta-da!

179
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,895
These are Namari's clothes,
but don't they suit her perfectly?

180
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,397
They're hard to move in.

181
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,774
It took some time to adjust them.

182
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,317
I got all chilled again.

183
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,693
I'm sorry, okay?

184
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:35,820
Well, let's hit the road.

185
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:36,737
Wait.

186
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,368
These are Mandrakes boiled sweet.

187
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,371
I figured they'd make
for good travel food.

188
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,251
Hey.

189
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,378
Have it.

190
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,214
That's yours.

191
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,133
I don't want it.

192
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,259
Why not?

193
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,844
It's really tasty.

194
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,262
I said I don't want it.

195
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,389
No, have a bite at least.

196
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,266
-Try it!
-I said no!

197
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,812
{\an8}H-How mean!

198
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,273
{\an8}Why did she have
to draw blood in this situation?

199
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,609
Just leave her be.
She'll eat when she's hungry.

200
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,279
Why don't you want it?

201
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,822
Because it's a monster.

202
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,033
Everyone says that, but how is it
different from eating animals?

203
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,704
If you eat monsters, you catch
strange diseases and turn into one!

204
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,788
That's why I won't eat it!

205
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,709
If eating monsters turned you into them,
it would be a simple story.

206
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,587
It's the idea of becoming impure.

207
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,755
It's not exactly logical,

208
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,176
but I think most people, myself included,
avoid them for that reason.

209
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,429
It feels like you're absorbing
something bad in some way.

210
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,808
{\an8}And with new diseases popping up
from creatures close to humans,

211
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,437
{\an8}I don't think vague aversion
should be brushed off so lightly.

212
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,774
This is really good!

213
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:01,697
{\an8}But what did you do before
when you were served food you didn't like?

214
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,782
Before?

215
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,328
Ugh!

216
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,957
Tade, you can have this.

217
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,711
Thanks, Izu… I mean, Asebi!

218
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,421
It never happened.

219
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,589
I don't believe you.

220
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,216
Let's go, you two!

221
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,729
The blizzard doesn't seem to be easing up.

222
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,524
Maybe we should just camp here for today.

223
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,858
I'm hungry too.

224
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,653
Senshi looks worn out as well.

225
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,738
Let's whip something up ourselves.

226
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,115
What ingredients do we have left?

227
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,159
Nightmares, Mandrakes,

228
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,577
eggs, mushrooms, and…

229
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,495
What's this?

230
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,038
Any fish?

231
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,540
No, no more fish.

232
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,707
Rice then.

233
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,252
We're running low on rice too.

234
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,921
Don't you have anything better than this?

235
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:00,130
This is all we've got.

236
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,007
Liar! You're hiding stuff!

237
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,969
You can't afford to be
a picky eater in the dungeon.

238
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,637
You should get used to it quickly.

239
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,555
No!

240
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,390
I only eat what I want to eat!

241
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,058
{\an8}Listen, Izutsumi.

242
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,394
{\an8}Eating monsters doesn't turn you into one.

243
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,523
<i>Has anyone turned into a sheep
or pig after eating them?</i>

244
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,985
<i>If a blind person eats an eyeball,
does that mean they'll see again?</i>

245
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,405
<i>Sheep only eat grass,
but do they turn into plants?</i>

246
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,325
Food and nutrition
are more complex than that.

247
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,661
That's why people work hard to experiment.

248
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,912
{\an8}Shut up!

249
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,248
What do you call that then?

250
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,165
That?

251
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,630
A sheep is growing into a tree.

252
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,549
It's a Barometz.

253
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,218
Why did it have to show up now?

254
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,720
Listen, Izutsumi.

255
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,221
That's a plant that always--

256
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,724
Shut up! I'm sick of your talk!

257
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:52,850
That's it.

258
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,727
I'm going to get that sheep.

259
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,103
{\an8}What's a Barometz?

260
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,563
{\an8}Is it some kind of monster?

261
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,982
{\an8}It's a monster all right,
but it's harmless.

262
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,983
{\an8}Although,

263
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,944
they do tend to attract carnivores.

264
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,655
Be careful, Izutsumi.

265
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,115
<i>Who does he think he's talking to?</i>

266
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,494
{\an8}It's not safe to stay here.

267
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,622
{\an8}-Let's harvest it quickly and--
-They're here.

268
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,623
Huh?

269
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,462
Dammit. Dire Wolves!

270
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,886
M-My staff!

271
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,017
Hold up!

272
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,518
Where are you going?

273
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,103
I hate dogs.

274
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,980
They're smelly, noisy, and persistent.

275
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,484
I-Is that reason enough
to just go off on your own?

276
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,694
I left you guys to deal with them.

277
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:49,949
You guys said friends are supposed
to make up for each other.

278
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,035
{\an8}That's not quite what we meant.

279
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,328
Then what did you mean?

280
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,289
You didn't join in on the fight
with the Golem back there.

281
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,875
It's true we left that to you,

282
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,794
but not because of personal preferences.

283
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,797
Hey, let's turn back.

284
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,048
No.

285
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,218
<i>I'm catching a whiff of fire in the wind.</i>

286
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,303
<i>If I follow it, I can find my way back.</i>

287
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,056
Wait!

288
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,185
<i>The scent's stronger to the right,</i>

289
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,688
<i>but the path looks rough,
so I'll go this way.</i>

290
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,940
Where are you heading?
Is this the right way?

291
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,609
I'll take the path I want.

292
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,569
You should do the same.

293
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,197
Why don't you do as you like more?

294
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,907
You hate eating monsters,

295
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,201
and yet you still do it.

296
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,120
It doesn't make sense.

297
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,705
{\an8}Well…

298
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,834
It seems the wolves have come after us.

299
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,085
Should we fight them here?

300
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,546
I can use explosive spells,

301
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,506
but I don't have my staff with me.

302
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,633
And it's risky to cast them
in such a confined space.

303
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,844
Maybe I can stun them with a bright light.

304
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,512
I'll run and shake them off.

305
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,226
What?!

306
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,367
Ow!

307
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,579
Owie.

308
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,622
Ow.

309
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,209
Hey, Asebi!

310
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,881
You made Tade clear off the snow
from the roof of the training hall.

311
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,882
I didn't.

312
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,341
Don't lie to me!

313
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,635
She fell from the roof while doing it.

314
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,221
Unlike you, she's clumsy,

315
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,766
so don't push tasks you dislike onto her!

316
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,101
You should show more gratitude to us
for taking you in.

317
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,231
Hey, Tade.

318
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,526
Why did you go and do something
I never asked you to do?

319
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,652
You really are dumb.

320
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,572
But Tade…

321
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,327
<i>What was it she said that day?</i>

322
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,287
Never mind.

323
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:06,710
<i>I slipped up.</i>

324
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,254
<i>The explosion shifted
the wind's direction,</i>

325
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,714
<i>and I failed to notice.</i>

326
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,679
Close… your eyes.

327
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,391
{\an8}Close your eyes.

328
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,769
{\an8}Close them!

329
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,986
T-Too close!

330
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,746
Izutsumi!

331
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:44,748
Are you alive?

332
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,792
Ow!

333
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,168
Your arm is broken.

334
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,336
Can you walk?

335
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,838
Let's rejoin the others.

336
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,012
Listen.

337
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,766
{\an8}You asked me why I eat monsters,

338
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,352
and I've been thinking about it.

339
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,021
I have my goals and objectives.

340
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,690
I want to help my friend

341
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,025
and learn more about magic.

342
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,071
So, I'm pushing toward those goals.

343
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,490
Along the way,
I encounter things I dislike.

344
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,493
Things that are bothersome,
things that tire me,

345
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,745
and having to eat things I'd rather not.

346
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,082
Individually, none of it is a big deal.

347
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,752
But if I avoid everything I dislike,

348
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,088
I'll stray further and further
from my path.

349
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,216
Just like what's happening to us now.

350
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,846
Why did you choose
to come along with us, Izutsumi?

351
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,808
Because you said that
if we met the lunatic magician,

352
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,394
there might be a chance
to break the curse on me.

353
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,353
It's this way!

354
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,022
Exactly.

355
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:53,066
That's why you need to be ready
to take a few shortcuts.

356
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,700
Izutsumi! Marcille!

357
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,826
Are you okay?

358
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,037
What about you guys?

359
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,331
We were in a bit of a fix,

360
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,918
<i>but Laios managed to scare them off,
so we're safe.</i>

361
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,087
<i>Most of the wolves
went after Marcille, anyway.</i>

362
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,048
Are you hurt?

363
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,758
It seems she broke her arm.

364
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,635
I'll use recovery magic on her

365
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,762
while I set it back into place,
so lend me a hand.

366
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,853
{\an8}You did great.

367
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,356
{\an8}The recovery magic hurt more.

368
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,025
I was hoping to harvest a Barometz,

369
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:38,070
but the wolves made off
with the mature one.

370
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,240
All that was left was this unripe fruit.

371
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,951
Let's try cooking it.

372
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,169
There's a sheep inside the fruit.

373
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,337
I can't eat that!

374
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,090
It's not the same as the others,
ethically speaking. I can't eat that!

375
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,007
Yuck.

376
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,761
Slice the Barometz ribs
into appropriate sizes,

377
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:05,264
season them, and cook them.

378
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,517
When both sides are nicely browned,

379
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,895
pour in some wine,
cover with a lid, and let them steam.

380
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,816
Run the rind of the fruit
through hot water, remove the peel,

381
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,401
then chop it into chunks.

382
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,153
Add garlic and stew together.

383
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,907
Pour the finished sauce over the meat,

384
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,409
and it's done.

385
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,911
BAROMETZ BALUT (OR BAROMETZ CHOPS)

386
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,913
Here, cat girl.

387
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,248
This is yours.

388
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,959
It's got weird stuff in it.

389
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,254
That's the Barometz skin and shoots.

390
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,300
You should've grilled the meat on its own.

391
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,935
Barometz might look just like sheep,

392
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,812
but they taste like crab!

393
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,022
<i>So what?</i>

394
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,190
<i>It's delicious.</i>

395
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,818
<i>I never knew food this amazing existed.</i>

396
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,321
<i>Come to think of it…</i>

397
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:06,700
Tade, why did you go and do something
I never asked you to do?

398
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,618
You really are dumb.

399
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,662
Tade just wants

400
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:13,999
to be helpful to everyone.

401
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,083
Ow!

402
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,377
I mean, this place is pretty great.

403
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,339
We get three meals,
warm bedding, and baths too.

404
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,884
I can't risk being kicked out.

405
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,595
I'll do chores and anything else
to show them I'm useful!

406
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:29,681
Asebi,

407
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:33,852
{\an8}don't lose your way just because
something is a bit bothersome.

408
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:40,525
{\an8}And Lady Maizuru sometimes
rewards me with snacks.

409
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:42,694
{\an8}That's what you're truly after, isn't it?

410
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,322
<i>Maybe she's right.</i>

411
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:48,658
<i>Sometimes you do end up
with something tasty out of it.</i>

412
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,664
Good for you, Izutsumi!

413
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,125
-Well done! Good girl!
-Good girl.

414
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,086
{\an8}Cut it out… You…

415
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,714
{\an8}What do you take me for, huh?!

416
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,801
I'll only eat when I have no other choice.

417
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,595
I won't be eating any vegetables
or monsters that taste bad, got it?

418
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,099
But you won't know if they taste bad
until you give them a try.

419
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,227
By the way, Marcille,
I noticed you're barely eating.

420
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,646
Do you really think
you can get away with not eating

421
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,606
after giving me that lecture?

422
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:25,070
<i>Marcille deeply regretted
blocking her own means of escape.</i>

423
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,489
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

424
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,991
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>

425
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,957
