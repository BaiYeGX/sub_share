1
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,390
Footsteps.

3
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,185
What a surprise.

4
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,853
They really are grilling meat.

5
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,650
I hope they're not criminals or that sort
who aren't allowed back on the surface.

6
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,401
We're just camping.

7
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,403
We mean no harm.

8
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,156
Wait a minute, I know that voice.

9
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,991
Just as I thought!

10
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,409
It's you, Laios!

11
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,911
-Namari!
-Namari!

12
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,204
You know them?

13
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,664
They're my former party members.

14
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,833
Hey, it's been a while.

15
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,668
Well, I guess it's only been a week.

16
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:08,837
Oh, let me introduce these people.

17
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,340
These are my current employers,
Mr. and Mrs. Tansu.

18
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:15,093
They work as someone's personal scholars,

19
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,095
and they pay really well.

20
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,597
And these two are the twins,
Kaka and Kiki.

21
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,475
To be honest,
I can never remember who's who.

22
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,104
Namari, how can you act like this

23
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,982
after abandoning Falin?

24
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,525
Abandon?

25
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:34,487
I simply refused
to walk into the jaws of death for free.

26
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,198
You…

27
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,868
Marcille, take it easy.

28
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,037
Hey, don't push yourselves.

29
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,040
Falin wouldn't want
anything to happen to you.

30
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,709
Right.

31
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,878
Is there a healer in your party?

32
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,588
My friend needs treatment.

33
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,840
What do we get in return?

34
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,429
We have Kelpie meat.

35
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:00,346
No, thanks!

36
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,223
Let's go, Namari.

37
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,435
Handing out charity in a dungeon
just sets you up to be taken advantage of.

38
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,605
Seriously, even that corpse
we stumbled upon on our way here

39
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,231
had their own revival fee with them.

40
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,734
Are you going to move on ahead?

41
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,111
There's an Undine roaming around,
and it's dangerous.

42
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,654
An Undine?

43
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,700
So, this girl
angered a water spirit, did she?

44
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,037
Don't underestimate us.

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,291
We gnomes have been living alongside
gods and spirits since ancient times.

46
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:34,505
To us, spirits are like neighbors,
not something to be afraid of.

47
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,509
Undine!

48
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,929
Oh, mighty water spirit!

49
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:44,098
Heed my voice and respond to me!

50
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,142
This isn't working.

51
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,313
Grandpa Tansu!

52
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,614
It didn't work.

53
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,908
N-Namari!

54
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,576
Namari died!

55
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,119
She'll recover in no time.

56
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,915
<i>Ira Fa Lane Brete Lane Bretego.</i>

57
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,379
Damn you, you old geezer!

58
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,756
You're always using me as your shield!

59
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,842
That's why I compensate you handsomely!

60
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,511
Resurrection magic, huh?

61
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,973
It's a magic
I especially can't bring myself to like.

62
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,392
You're against resurrection?

63
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:30,395
It's not a pleasant sight to witness.

64
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,439
It's unnatural for the dead
to come back to life.

65
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:37,777
Outside the dungeon, sure,
but in here, it's normal.

66
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,028
It's not normal.

67
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,572
It's not normal, Laios.

68
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,074
That's right.

69
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,120
This dungeon
is under a very powerful enchantment.

70
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,082
<i>It binds your soul to your body.</i>

71
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:55,837
<i>So, no matter how damaged your body gets,
your soul is never released.</i>

72
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,798
<i>And once your injuries are mended,
you can be revived.</i>

73
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,633
In my perspective,

74
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,678
this isn't the dead coming back to life.

75
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,390
In this place, death itself is forbidden.

76
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,102
It is a truly dreadful curse.

77
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,812
But that aside,

78
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,691
I study such ancient spells.

79
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:20,069
I came here to investigate
a magic circle in this area,

80
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,823
but as you can see,
my escort isn't very dependable.

81
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,036
If you help me with my investigation,

82
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,329
I will heal your companion.

83
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,837
Deal.

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,715
Senshi and I will accompany you.

85
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,847
This should be the area.

86
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,017
Elven characters.

87
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,102
What terrible penmanship.

88
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,188
The roots are in the way. Remove them.

89
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,279
Laios, you still have that creepy sword?

90
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,406
I keep telling you, but--

91
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,742
"Use one from the shop," right? I know.

92
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,577
You have to get one crafted by a dwarf.

93
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,163
And avoid shops
that are tended by a half-foot.

94
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,998
And don't use the same scabbard.

95
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:14,916
And…

96
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,002
{\an8}You should give your weapon
some care now and then!

97
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,587
I pity your axe!

98
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,591
You probably think
I'm being annoying, don't you?

99
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,550
No.

100
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:28,763
{\an8}When it comes to handling weapons,
I trust you more than anyone else.

101
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,816
Stay back.

102
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:41,359
What is it?

103
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,568
There's a monster lurking.

104
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,986
Then kill it.

105
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,114
I don't know what or where it is.

106
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,866
Then how can you be certain
there's a monster?

107
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,284
J-Just a feeling.

108
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,452
Are you serious?

109
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,829
Mr. Tansu.

110
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,582
{\an8}You should trust Laios
when he's like this.

111
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,627
I can't afford
to entertain a baseless suspicion.

112
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,255
If it's lurking, simply drag it out.

113
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,563
Oh, I see.

114
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,398
It's a Tentacles.

115
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,191
This isn't the time to admire it!

116
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,735
Kiki! Hang in there!

117
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,112
Hey, don't just stand there!

118
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,989
Defeat the monster already!

119
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,615
Our weapons can't reach it.

120
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,367
Hurry up and do something!

121
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,829
What if we purposefully let ourselves
get caught to get up close?

122
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,123
Tentacles is part of the cnidarian family.

123
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,417
<i>If their feelers
make contact with your skin,</i>

124
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,627
<i>they shoot out venomous spines
that paralyze you.</i>

125
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,131
If we get caught, there's a good chance
we won't make it out alive.

126
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,258
Even if you die, I'll resurrect you!

127
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,259
Listen…

128
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:50,303
Fine. I'll go.

129
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,764
Senshi, let me borrow your helmet.

130
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,270
Laios, you shouldn't do this!

131
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,231
You shouldn't count
on the success rate of resurrection magic.

132
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,483
It's going to be okay.

133
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,361
Because you and Senshi
are who I'm counting on.

134
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,033
-Huh? What did he mean by that?
-I don't know.

135
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,117
All right.

136
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,369
Hey! Over here, Tentacles!

137
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,791
Ow!

138
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,294
They're piercing me through my armor,
just as I feared.

139
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,797
My arms are already going numb.

140
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,174
But…

141
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,301
What on earth are you doing, Laios?

142
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,511
Target its midsection!

143
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,428
Its midsection!

144
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,608
{\an8}Dammit.

145
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,692
{\an8}<i>So that's what he meant!</i>

146
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,987
<i>He gave me the trickiest task!</i>

147
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,037
Kiki!

148
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,586
Laios, are you okay?

149
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:10,383
I guess not.

150
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,805
Wait, what?

151
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,349
Oh, Kiki. What happened to you?

152
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,268
I'll heal you right away.

153
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,438
This is going to be a little tricky.

154
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,024
Sorry, this might take a while.

155
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,401
Take your time.

156
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:32,029
Is it just me,
or does your face look different?

157
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,031
I got stung by a Tentacles.

158
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,951
What should I do about this?

159
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,036
Why are you grasping that?

160
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,206
When I tore it off, my hand went numb,
and now I can't let go.

161
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,625
Your hand looks like a gnome's now.

162
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,960
Let me see.

163
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,504
Ivy Tentacles, huh?

164
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,716
"Rinsing it with vinegar can reduce
some of the stingers' activity."

165
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,428
"It can have the opposite effect
depending on the species of Tentacles,

166
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,470
so proceed with caution."

167
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,474
"Make a cross-shaped incision
in the cross-section and peel vertically

168
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,852
to remove the outer layer
with the stingers."

169
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,856
TENTACLES WITH VINEGAR DRESSING

170
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,774
Apparently, it tastes pretty good.

171
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,900
Are you joking?

172
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,486
No, it's just a fun fact…

173
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,239
If that's the only way,
then I have no other choice.

174
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,490
What?

175
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,452
I see. It's not bad.

176
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,204
If prepared right,
it'll be even more delicious.

177
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,623
Let me have a bite, too!

178
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,876
This…

179
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,670
tastes different depending on the part!

180
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,380
You're definitely imagining it.

181
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,090
No, it's true!

182
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,133
Try it.

183
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,888
It only tastes like vinegar.

184
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,182
Do you want a bite, too, Marcille?

185
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,850
Huh? What is it?

186
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,187
It tastes sour.

187
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,230
It's kinda gooey.

188
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,651
-It's taro root. Tell me it's taro root.
-You, too, Namari.

189
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,070
This part. I recommend this part.

190
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,696
No! No, thanks!

191
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,407
We're not lacking food!

192
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,284
It tastes good, though.

193
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,162
Not quite,
but it could be if prepared right.

194
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,956
Either stew it or mash it and then fry it.

195
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,416
Sounds good!

196
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,336
It slipped off!

197
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,299
Sorry for the wait.

198
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,884
I'll treat you now.

199
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,302
Thank you.

200
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,930
Well then, please heal her first.

201
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:30,439
<i>Ilava Rietge Atheus Pilitos
Nuswera Iboiseme Seus Wehrba.</i>

202
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,655
{\an8}It feels awesome being in good health!

203
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,033
Thank you, Mr. Tansu.

204
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:41,951
You, too, Laios.

205
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,328
{\an8}What's with your face?

206
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,830
{\an8}Thank Namari instead.

207
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,747
{\an8}What?

208
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,042
Your marksmanship was truly remarkable.

209
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,253
It's amazing you took it down
with just one shot.

210
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,548
We're lucky you're skilled
with a crossbow, too.

211
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,592
Actually, it was my first time using one.

212
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,510
What?

213
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,178
Namari.

214
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,850
Thanks for giving us a hand.

215
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,852
I'll set aside the incident
with Falin for now.

216
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,187
{\an8}You're most welcome.

217
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,984
{\an8}Getting paid makes you give it your best,
more so than doing it for free.

218
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,364
Now, now, you two.

219
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,907
It's all in the past now.

220
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,534
It totally isn't!

221
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:27,288
Why are you, of all people,
acting like it's none of your business?

222
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,664
Unbelievable!

223
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,875
-That's not what I meant!
-Are you the leader?

224
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,460
Tough role, huh?

225
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,256
It's looking this way.

226
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,925
Is it still upset?

227
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,637
What did you do
to make the spirit so furious?

228
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:46,056
I've never been attacked by one
so fiercely before.

229
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,602
{\an8}I may have accidentally poured
boiling water directly onto it.

230
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,771
That's not good. Typical of an elf.

231
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,440
Elves…

232
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:56,817
My race has nothing to do with it!

233
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:01,197
Is there a way to pacify the spirit
without using magic?

234
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,573
That's simple.

235
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:05,951
<i>An Undine is a collective of tiny spirits.</i>

236
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,246
<i>If the individuals comprising it
naturally dies off,</i>

237
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,333
<i>their hostility will fade away
as new generations emerge.</i>

238
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,504
The lifespan of a spirit
is a week at most.

239
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,339
A week?

240
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,758
I can't wait that long.

241
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,343
Neither can we.

242
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,971
So, we will return to the surface for now.

243
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,807
We'll resume our investigation
another time.

244
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,435
Hey, let's prepare the return spell.

245
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,356
Hey, Laios.
They're preparing the return spell.

246
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,943
Mr. Tansu, I have a favor to ask you.

247
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,489
You want me to return
to the surface with them?

248
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,783
Now? After coming all this way?

249
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,118
You're currently out of magic.

250
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,247
I've heard that running out of magic
is similar to having anemia.

251
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,166
You should head back to the surface
with Mr. Tansu's party.

252
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,417
I'm fine.

253
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,503
I'm actually quite surprised
by how great I feel.

254
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,213
Oh, I think it might be due to the liver.

255
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,383
Eating nutritious food won't result
in immediate changes to your condition.

256
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,343
-It's one's daily--
-I'll listen to that later.

257
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,804
I really feel fantastic.

258
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,431
I think some of my magic returned as well
after a short rest.

259
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:14,270
But your staff doesn't seem
to have the usual magical aura.

260
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,564
T-That's because…

261
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,526
Let's leave her.

262
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,112
Why are you laughing?

263
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,532
It's just that I've never seen you
with that expression before.

264
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,033
But…

265
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,452
what are you going to do
when you're on your own?

266
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,247
The three of you
can't fight a dragon by yourselves.

267
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,040
Don't count me in.

268
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:40,754
Plus, that axe of yours doesn't seem like
it could harm a dragon in the slightest.

269
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:46,302
Namari, you've defeated
many dragons, right?

270
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,178
Yeah.

271
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,681
Well then…

272
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,435
Please, Namari.

273
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,061
Rejoin our party!

274
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,938
{\an8}Are you serious?

275
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:01,567
Help Laios' party defeat the Red Dragon.

276
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,028
I want to rescue Falin, no matter what!

277
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,905
Just this once!

278
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,032
I'll find a way to gather the funds!

279
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,742
Forget it, Marcille.

280
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,577
Why?

281
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,038
The adventurer community is small.

282
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,749
Gossip travels like wildfire.

283
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,336
Namari has been having
financial problems for some time now.

284
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,422
And you got wind of it,
didn't you, Mr. Tansu?

285
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,381
I did.

286
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,968
Now, imagine if she rejoined
her former party for money.

287
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,221
<i>"She'll do anything for the right price."</i>

288
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,849
<i>That's what people will say about her.</i>

289
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,227
<i>It may open up more job opportunities,</i>

290
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,480
<i>but it'd probably attract
a different clientele.</i>

291
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,398
So, forget it.

292
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,859
Especially if you care
about both your futures.

293
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,695
That's how it is.

294
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,489
Forget it, Marcille.

295
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,750
{\an8}No. There's still another way.

296
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,503
{\an8}There's another way for me
to regain my magic.

297
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,505
W-What is it?

298
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,382
I drink…

299
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,258
{\an8}the Undine!

300
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,720
What? The Undine?

301
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,223
What's with your reactions?

302
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,891
Where's your usual enthusiasm?

303
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,893
I'm not so interested in spirits.

304
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,854
Spirits live on magic.

305
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,899
I'm certain they're abundant
in magical energy!

306
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:28,070
<i>Capturing it seems trickier
than defeating it, though.</i>

307
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:33,075
But water spirits are vulnerable to heat,
so maybe I can use that.

308
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,744
{\an8}Maybe we can attack it
with a heated weapon.

309
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,874
{\an8}Or maybe we can pour oil on the lake,
set it on fire, and trap the spirit?

310
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,421
{\an8}When it attacks, it spills on the ground,

311
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,089
{\an8}and maybe I could quickly drink that.

312
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,468
{\an8}It'd probably poke holes
in your body from the inside.

313
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,720
{\an8}You're right.

314
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,347
{\an8}Come on, think.

315
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,473
{\an8}There must be a way.

316
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,272
By heating this pot
and using it as a shield,

317
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,982
I could defend and attack simultaneously.

318
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,568
{\an8}Undines are powerful enough
to penetrate a stone column, though.

319
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,611
{\an8}You think that shabby pot can protect you?

320
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,114
It's unfair to call it a shabby pot.

321
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,743
It's a family heirloom that's been
passed down through generations.

322
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,120
I have diligently maintained it.

323
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,040
It never gets burnt
and it distributes heat evenly.

324
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,624
It's an exceptional pot.

325
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,376
Hold on.

326
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,130
The color, the sheen,

327
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,300
the weight, the texture…

328
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,385
This is adamant!

329
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,845
Unbelievable.

330
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,889
As a weapon,
it can shatter a dragon's bone.

331
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:38,932
As armor,
it shields even against a dragon's fangs.

332
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:43,395
Adamant, the metal
that every blacksmith dreams of.

333
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,397
So, why is it used for a pot?

334
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,068
It was originally a shield,
but I had no need for it, so…

335
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,028
How can you be so wasteful?!

336
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:53,280
{\an8}Do you think it could withstand
an Undine's assault?

337
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:54,573
{\an8}Of course, it could!

338
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,950
We happen to have both a pot and a lid,

339
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,703
so two of us can wield one each
to attack it from both sides…

340
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,790
And we'll burn it with fire!

341
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,583
It's the only option we have.

342
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:06,835
<i>Really?</i>

343
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,922
<i>Even if they have tough shields,
the Undine is so powerful.</i>

344
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:14,635
<i>Maybe the dwarf could restrain it,
but is Laios strong enough?</i>

345
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,850
Brace yourself as soon
as the surface starts to warp.

346
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:25,312
Let's not waste this opportunity.

347
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,942
Here comes!

348
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,903
Laios!

349
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,663
<i>What incredible power!</i>

350
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,672
Laios!

351
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,559
Namari…

352
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:16,780
{\an8}Now!

353
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,790
Good. Keep going.

354
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,417
Hang in there!

355
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,294
Place it over the flames!

356
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,068
So hot!

357
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,487
-Wow, this is amazing!
-Incredible.

358
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,448
What astounding strength!

359
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,993
Namari, Senshi, thank you so much!

360
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,703
You, too, Laios.

361
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,288
Are you okay?

362
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,624
Despite his physique, he's pretty flimsy.

363
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,250
Just like a typical tall-man.

364
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:11,835
Right.

365
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,554
No need to drink it all in one go.

366
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,016
Spirit magic is hard to absorb.

367
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:31,772
It's fundamental to pair nutrition
with something that aids in absorption.

368
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,523
Senshi.

369
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,984
Let's start cooking.

370
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,907
<i>Peel the potatoes, carrots,
onions, and the Tentacles.</i>

371
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,992
<i>Then cut them into bite-sized pieces.</i>

372
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,537
<i>Marinate the Kelpie meat
with salt and pepper,</i>

373
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,748
<i>and fry until the surface changes color.</i>

374
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,542
<i>Add the onions and carrots
and sauté them together,</i>

375
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,586
<i>then put them into the Undine.</i>

376
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,298
<i>Skim well,</i>

377
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,927
<i>then add the potatoes
and spices and simmer.</i>

378
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:11,770
It's done!

379
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,314
UNDINE STEW WITH TENTACLES AND KELPIE

380
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,233
Huh? Where did everyone go?

381
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,194
They went to continue their investigation
at the tower across the water.

382
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,405
{\an8}We're back!

383
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,824
{\an8}I had no idea there would be so many.

384
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,034
{\an8}Good thing we dealt with them.

385
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,078
{\an8}H-Hey!

386
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:32,082
Would you like to join us for a meal?

387
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,046
Here you go.

388
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,215
Looks good.

389
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,259
Did you make this, Marcille?

390
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,970
Senshi helped a lot.

391
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,389
Here, Namari.

392
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,144
You should start eating
instead of serving everyone.

393
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,729
O-Okay.

394
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:07,993
Yes!

395
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,120
Some magic is starting to come back.

396
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,205
You guys,

397
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,043
did you come this far
while scavenging all this time?

398
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,377
Yup.

399
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:21,423
<i>I was ready to face criticism
for leaving the party,</i>

400
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,551
<i>but I never expected
to see them resort to this.</i>

401
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,138
<i>Maybe this is a form of punishment.</i>

402
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,522
<i>It's delicious! The broth
has been infused into the ingredients.</i>

403
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,691
<i>How did everything cook so quickly?</i>

404
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,026
<i>Is it because of the pot?</i>

405
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:43,612
<i>Could adamant
be a good material for making pots?</i>

406
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,239
Senshi, was it?

407
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,242
Um, about your axe…

408
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,369
I apologize for making fun of it.

409
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,122
It's all right.

410
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:58,251
The truth is, I have no interest
in any blacksmithing work.

411
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,713
I can't distinguish
different types of ore,

412
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,425
and my old friends
used to get frustrated with me often.

413
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,971
Namari, we're heading back to the surface.

414
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,934
{\an8}But you can stay here.

415
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,437
{\an8}What are you talking about?

416
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,731
Try a bite at least!

417
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,192
The texture is a bit odd,
but it tastes quite good!

418
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,360
{\an8}But…

419
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,154
{\an8}I know I can't ask you to trust me…

420
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,741
but I want to be more
than just a hired hand.

421
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,410
I want to be accepted as one of you.

422
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:35,038
I'll work hard.

423
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,427
Frankly, Chilchuck,

424
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,097
I thought you'd be the first one
to leave the party.

425
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,475
You're not the kind to accept unpaid work.

426
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:56,893
Damn right.

427
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,479
That's why I always insist
on getting paid upfront.

428
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:03,733
But the problem is that I can't walk away
when situations like this arise.

429
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,361
{\an8}What? You stayed because it was your job?

430
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,572
{\an8}Not for your friends or friendship?

431
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,615
{\an8}Listen, Marcille.

432
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,617
{\an8}Let me tell you something important.

433
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,495
Folks who claim
they don't need anything in return

434
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,415
are the least trustworthy in this world.

435
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,751
By the way, what's Shuro up to now?

436
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,420
No idea.

437
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,505
He seemed to have
another contact to reach out to.

438
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,550
But he was so in love with Falin
that he wanted to propose to her.

439
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,011
So, he's probably still
desperately searching for her.

440
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,805
What? I had no clue.

441
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,515
-He's so oblivious.
-Totally.

442
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,517
Look, I get that you guys

443
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:43,148
{\an8}all care about Falin, but be sure
to make it back to the surface, okay?

444
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,444
Namari, you take care, too.

445
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,578
See ya!

446
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:30,964
