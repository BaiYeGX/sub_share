1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,057
Izutsumi, Chilchuck…

3
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,935
Could you slow down a bit?

4
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,646
{\an8}Cracks are all over the floor,
and it's hard to walk.

5
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,398
I didn't notice.

6
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,818
Let's take a break.

7
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,071
{\an8}What is this? An old folks' stroll?

8
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,783
Something's bothering me.

9
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,826
In our current forms,

10
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,287
{\an8}how different are our actual ages
from how old we look?

11
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,998
Laios, how old are you now?

12
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,750
I'm 26.

13
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,337
Senshi, how old
does Laios look to you now?

14
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,340
Around 60, maybe?

15
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:16,136
<i>They say a dwarf lives
2.5 times longer than a tall-man.</i>

16
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,304
<i>So 26 years for a tall-man…</i>

17
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,932
<i>is like 65 for a dwarf.</i>

18
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:25,103
<i>So, our appearance
reflects our actual age.</i>

19
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,064
What really concerns me
is our remaining lifespan.

20
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:31,359
Do we age at the same pace
as before our transformation,

21
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,862
or do we age according to our new forms?

22
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:38,324
Marcille, you act like
this is none of your concern.

23
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,784
But if the latter is true,

24
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:43,121
the average lifespan
for us half-foots is 50!

25
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:47,208
{\an8}In less than 40 years,
you'll be all wrinkled and die!

26
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,418
{\an8}What?!

27
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,254
WRINKLECILLE

28
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,631
Is the lifespan really that short?

29
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,717
I thought you could live until 100.

30
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,385
Some do, but…

31
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,761
It's only a small percentage.

32
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,269
I was just joking.

33
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:11,065
My point is, if that's true,
these mushrooms are too convenient.

34
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,069
There are loads of people who would pay
a fortune to change their race,

35
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,780
but I've never seen those mushrooms
for sale anywhere.

36
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:20,366
<i>In other words, this transformation
must be temporary,</i>

37
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,118
<i>or it comes with nasty side effects.</i>

38
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,162
Side effects, huh?

39
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,039
That's a possibility.

40
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,541
I was hoping
we could make use of it somehow,

41
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,460
but I guess it's not that simple.

42
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,961
Make use of it how?

43
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,963
Do you want to become
a demi-human or something?

44
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,548
T-That's not it.

45
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,801
I was thinking about Falin.

46
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,136
Falin?

47
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,347
This is just a what-if, but…

48
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,558
Say everything works out, and we manage
to defeat the lunatic magician.

49
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,936
I repent.

50
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,312
<i>Falin regains herself.</i>

51
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,398
What have I been doing?

52
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,566
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

53
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,235
<i>We return to the surface.</i>

54
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,195
Honestly, we had such a rough time!

55
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,073
<i>People will be terrified.</i>

56
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,574
{\an8}Right?

57
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:05,078
I think it'll be tough for her
to remain a dragon from the waist down.

58
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,329
-You stupid--
-Hold on!

59
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,789
Let's hear him out.

60
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,292
<i>I've thought of hiding the lower part
of her body inside a hole.</i>

61
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,335
Welcome!

62
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,461
<i>However,</i>

63
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,966
{\an8}a large monster can't survive
in a village with little mana.

64
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,427
Just like a fish can't survive
outside of water,

65
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,347
Falin might not be able
to survive in a village.

66
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,474
And that's where

67
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,644
those Changeling mushrooms come into play.

68
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,732
<i>If we can somehow change
her lower body to a smaller dragon,</i>

69
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,069
Falin might be able to live comfortably
in a human village!

70
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,281
-What--
-What an optimistic guy!

71
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,490
Mušḫuššu!

72
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:46,494
{\an8}Well, I won't deny
that I also have a wish to transform.

73
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:50,290
Tall-men are just
so unremarkable and dull…

74
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,001
Hey, don't you hear that strange noise?

75
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,129
No. It's probably
the sound of dwarf relics.

76
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,338
It's not that.

77
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,882
It sounds like rocks
striking against each other.

78
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,511
And it seems like
it's slowly getting closer.

79
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,306
I know.

80
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,850
{\an8}Gargoyles!

81
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,020
Didn't you close the door properly?

82
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,896
W-We need to get out of here quickly!

83
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,149
They're getting closer!

84
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,610
If we don't do something,
they'll keep coming after us.

85
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,447
We should ambush them.

86
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,407
{\an8}B-But…

87
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,992
{\an8}I'll distract the enemies.

88
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,327
{\an8}Chilchuck, hold the pot.

89
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,162
{\an8}Izutsumi, slip around behind them.

90
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,830
{\an8}Senshi, wait for the right moment.

91
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,457
{\an8}Marcille, how close are the enemies?

92
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,541
{\an8}Like I said,

93
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,293
they're right there!

94
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,297
Laios!

95
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,633
Damn it!

96
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,761
Everyone, watch out!

97
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,062
Do you get why the first thing I do
is take cover?

98
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,855
Don't hang around our feet.

99
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,440
Easier said than done…

100
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,776
Forget it! You're still as clumsy as ever.

101
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,777
Come here!

102
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,741
What is this smoke?

103
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,993
Is it one of your magic?

104
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,579
Are you two hurt?

105
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:14,123
No! The sword
just passed between our arms!

106
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,083
Good.

107
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,667
Pass me Kensuke, would you?

108
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,585
Sure.

109
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,715
Did it always look like that?

110
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,758
Nope.

111
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,384
Has the shape of the sword changed?

112
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,012
Was that smoke…

113
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,140
-Spores from Changelings?
-Spores from Changelings?

114
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,769
{\an8}B-But I don't see
a ring of mushrooms anywhere.

115
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,271
It passed through a circle
we formed with our arms.

116
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,108
Does that mean…

117
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,533
They keep flying away!

118
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,534
Everyone!

119
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:52,286
Hold hands and make a ring right now!

120
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,122
Read the situation before you say that!

121
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,248
I did!

122
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,043
Now what?

123
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,170
What do we do?

124
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,048
We'll get a Gargoyle
to pass through our ring.

125
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,925
If my guess is correct,

126
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,594
{\an8}the Gargoyle will transform!

127
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,514
Here it comes! Dodge!

128
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,724
There's a wall on that side! This way!

129
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,767
Ow!

130
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,520
I'll tear in two!

131
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,525
Owie.

132
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,787
It's stuck!

133
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,289
Now, surround it quickly!

134
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,925
{\an8}We did it! Where's the Gargoyle?

135
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,302
{\an8}Look!

136
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,681
That's the Gargoyle?

137
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,850
It really transformed!

138
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,352
I see. The Changelings caused this.

139
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,314
So nonliving things change faster.

140
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,232
Laios!

141
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,358
Are you okay?

142
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,360
It hurts, but I'll manage.

143
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,071
Dwarves have sturdy bodies.

144
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,114
{\an8}Damn it.

145
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,911
That one won't come down.

146
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:17,622
How can we get it
to pass through our arms?

147
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,294
-Marcille.
-Huh?

148
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,795
-Give me your hand for a bit.
-Huh?

149
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,967
-It should work.
-Um.

150
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,427
-Let's do it.
-All right!

151
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,096
We're going to get up close to it,

152
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,265
and provoke it into attacking us!

153
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,559
-Hey, what do I--
-Run in sync with the call!

154
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:39,936
Here we go!

155
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,190
-One, two…
-One, two…

156
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:50,071
-One, two…
-One, two…

157
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,242
Here it comes! Are you ready?

158
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,826
Ready for what?!

159
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,662
-Ready, set…
-Ready, set…

160
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,580
Fly, Marcille!

161
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,805
It's over.

162
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,933
There was nothing to it.

163
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:23,354
All we had to do was wash the spores
off our bodies to turn back.

164
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,731
It feels wrong.

165
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,775
Don't worry about it. It's just water.

166
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,860
You should wash them off thoroughly.

167
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,613
Right now, we're like
seedbeds for mushrooms.

168
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,660
<i>Now I understand why those mushrooms
have this characteristic.</i>

169
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,081
<i>When animals have their forms
changed by Changelings…</i>

170
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,416
-Run!
-Run!

171
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,001
<i>They're hated by their own kind.</i>

172
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:46,669
<i>They die.</i>

173
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,255
<i>And they become new Changelings.</i>

174
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:51,173
It's quite the side effect.

175
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,595
Unlike Gargoyles,
it'll take time for us to turn back.

176
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,972
Let's prepare a meal as we wait.

177
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,433
Of course.

178
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,189
<i>Kensuke,</i><i>look at how you've changed.</i>

179
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:12,612
<i>I doubt it was the mushrooms
that turned the insides into a key, but…</i>

180
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,406
<i>Will it revert if I give it a wash?</i>

181
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,660
What are we having today?

182
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:23,080
We still have some dumplings left,
so we'll boil them.

183
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,415
That again.

184
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,459
Do you have a problem?

185
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,544
Not really. I'm just tired of them.

186
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,298
-<i>Tired of them?</i>
-She sure is a free spirit.

187
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,635
<i>I'll try cooking them differently.</i>

188
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:41,349
<i>Heat oil in a pan,
and gently place the dumplings in it.</i>

189
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,309
H-Hot!

190
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,897
<i>When the wrappers are golden brown,
take them out and let the oil drain.</i>

191
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,983
{\an8}<i>Izutsumi is a light eater</i>

192
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,402
{\an8}<i>and never touches something
she doesn't like.</i>

193
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,740
<i>To make sure she eats enough,
I have to put in the time and effort.</i>

194
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,412
What do you think, Izutsumi?

195
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,414
You just fried them?

196
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,124
Stop that!

197
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,172
<i>Just maybe…</i>

198
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,305
It changed its shape!

199
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,975
Just as I thought,
it seems like the mouth acts as a ring.

200
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,978
And there are so many
varieties of dumplings.

201
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,690
What if I eat one and end up
growing mushrooms in my stomach?

202
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:36,070
We had the Hippogriff's meat,
and that didn't happen.

203
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,696
Digestion is quite powerful.

204
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,783
Now, help set the dishes.

205
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,785
It's done!

206
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,454
DUMPLINGS TRANSFORMED
BY A CHANGELING FAIRY RING

207
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,331
There are so many types.

208
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,922
This one has Barometz meat in it.

209
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,632
Mutton, huh?

210
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,717
So the filling changes too.

211
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,429
This one's got cheese inside!

212
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,222
This one's sweet.

213
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,142
<i>What meat is this?</i>

214
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,818
Your legs are just too long!

215
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:20,573
{\an8}My body's back to normal!

216
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,615
{\an8}Damn it.

217
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,367
{\an8}What an awful way to wake up.

218
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,161
Thank goodness.

219
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,996
I'm so glad.

220
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,040
Well then, we should get going soon.

221
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:33,252
You should change into something lighter.

222
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:35,337
This floor is warm.

223
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,633
The temperature is conducive
to creature reproduction.

224
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:44,346
But I'm not sure if there are any living
things ahead in this environment.

225
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,267
I should have made sausages or something.

226
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,854
Speaking of which,
didn't you make some with Red Dragon meat?

227
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:53,898
<i>I did.</i>

228
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,065
BONELESS DRAGON HAM

229
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,193
But I lost them.

230
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,569
Is that so?

231
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,820
Never mind.

232
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,448
I don't like it when it's hot.

233
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,702
Why is your sword wrapped in a cloth?

234
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,871
{\an8}Huh? That's because…

235
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,164
{\an8}Show me.

236
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,124
{\an8}No, I can't do that.

237
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,334
{\an8}Show me!

238
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,962
What should we do with him?

239
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,007
Should we form a ring around him
and beat him up?

240
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,801
Go wash it off right now.

241
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,722
How are things over there?

242
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,099
All I see is a strange building.

243
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,893
I don't see any other paths.

244
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,606
A strange building?

245
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:42,154
It's probably an automatic trolley.

246
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,031
Let's take a peek inside.

247
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,912
I bet it won't move anymore.

248
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,541
If you dismantle it and sell it,
you can fetch a pretty good price.

249
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,420
It moved!

250
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,673
Senshi, what did you do?

251
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:01,966
Nothing.

252
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,219
Maybe it's the type that moves
when someone boards it.

253
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,055
There's a description here,
so I'll read it.

254
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,932
Take a seat.

255
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,492
There isn't much written here.

256
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:31,829
It doesn't feel dangerous so far,

257
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,206
so let's ride it as far as it goes.

258
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,587
Maybe I'll brew some tea.

259
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,464
What's that?

260
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,342
Roasted Dryad seeds.

261
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,177
Is the magic circle ready?

262
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,262
I think so.

263
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,599
I can't say for sure if it's working.

264
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,937
{\an8}It's slow, but it seems to be heating up.

265
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,981
By the way, Laios,

266
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,776
why did you and your sister
become adventurers?

267
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,570
{\an8}Huh? Me?

268
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,823
{\an8}You don't strike me as someone
who dreams of making a fortune.

269
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,452
{\an8}It's a long story, but…

270
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,498
{\an8}<i>When I was in my teens,
I got fed up with my village.</i>

271
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,251
<i>And I went to a school in the town
and joined the army.</i>

272
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,255
{\an8}<i>But in the end,
I didn't fit in there either.</i>

273
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,425
<i>And I got picked up by a caravan
that passed through the town.</i>

274
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,135
<i>So he's a deserter?</i>

275
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,306
<i>I slowly drifted south,
taking odd jobs along the way.</i>

276
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,353
<i>Falin was boarding
at a nearby magic school,</i>

277
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,521
<i>so I dropped by to see her.</i>

278
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,857
<i>But she insisted on joining me.</i>

279
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,988
<i>And together, we reached this island.</i>

280
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,868
<i>When we first arrived on this island,
gold-peeling was thriving.</i>

281
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,787
<i>And there was plenty of escorting work.</i>

282
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,500
<i>Then, we just stayed
and hung around the dungeon.</i>

283
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,054
That's how I ended up here.

284
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,433
What a complete lack of foresight.

285
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:20,062
You're one thing, but why did you
let your sister go with you?

286
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,856
She could've had a better life at school.

287
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,404
<i>Falin's childhood wasn't very fortunate.</i>

288
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,198
<i>She had a talent for magic,
which she was shunned for.</i>

289
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,327
<i>I couldn't stand the environment.</i>

290
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,746
<i>So I left the village
a year before she did.</i>

291
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,000
<i>Until she entered the magic school, no,</i>

292
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,335
<i>until she met Marcille,</i>

293
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,462
<i>she had her meals all alone.</i>

294
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,675
It breaks my heart to think about it.

295
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:55,180
Well, Falin's spirit
was much stronger than mine,

296
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,975
so maybe it didn't bother her too much.

297
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,855
But that's why I made a promise to myself
to never abandon her again.

298
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:06,817
At least, not until someone else shows up
whom she wants to be with.

299
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,994
What the heck? Gross!

300
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,163
Falin…

301
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,583
used to bring me a lot of things.

302
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,086
<i>Strange nuts.</i>

303
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,047
<i>And odd plants.</i>

304
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,675
<i>I've always wondered
why she kept bringing them to me, but…</i>

305
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,012
She probably wanted
to eat them with you, Marcille.

306
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,908
{\an8}I can't wait…

307
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,702
{\an8}to share meals with her again.

308
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,622
You'll be able to soon.

309
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,917
The way I see it,

310
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,753
Falin is like bacon and eggs right now.

311
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,924
We once compared souls to eggs.

312
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,718
<i>A sunny side up rests on top
of strips of bacon.</i>

313
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,931
<i>They're stuck together, but it looks like
we can peel them apart nicely.</i>

314
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,724
<i>That's Falin.</i>

315
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,352
Compared to that,
Izutsumi is more like an omelet

316
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,937
with ingredients mixed inside.

317
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,191
<i>With effort, you might be able
to remove the ingredients,</i>

318
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,903
<i>but it's easy to imagine
the egg getting broken up.</i>

319
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,614
So, in Izutsumi's case,

320
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:40,202
we'll have to find a more careful
and complicated approach.

321
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,454
In other words,

322
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,457
<i>if we cut off the dragon waist down,</i>

323
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,960
<i>can we turn Falin back
into her human form?</i>

324
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,963
It's not that simple, is it?

325
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,589
That day,

326
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,926
I preserved some of the Dragon meat,

327
00:18:56,009 --> 00:19:01,181
but it all turned back into flesh
and merged with Falin.

328
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,686
<i>On the other hand, some of the meat
didn't turn back into a dragon.</i>

329
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,356
It's the parts that we ate at dinner.

330
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:14,820
Meat that has been digested
by other creatures loses its identity.

331
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,490
{\an8}This is the only clear law in this dungeon

332
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,660
{\an8}where the line
between life and death is blurred.

333
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:26,456
In that case,
if we consume all the dragon parts,

334
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,003
we may be able to drive out
the soul of the dragon.

335
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,049
Y-You know,

336
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,760
I'm surprised
to hear that from you, Senshi.

337
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,972
I thought you were against
that sort of thing.

338
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:45,267
I'm still against resurrecting people.

339
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,896
However, Falin is alive now.

340
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:53,775
And you just want to release her
from the dungeon.

341
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,029
I'll gladly help you with that.

342
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,782
Eat the dragon parts.

343
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,119
B-But…

344
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,831
how many meals would that make?

345
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,541
-That's your problem?
-That's your problem?

346
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,959
What else would it be?

347
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,587
It's the most promising method
we've got so far!

348
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,589
Do you have a better idea?

349
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:19,259
{\an8}Consuming a creature you've killed
to make it your own.

350
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,595
{\an8}Why didn't I realize it sooner?

351
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:24,348
{\an8}It's what we've been doing all along!

352
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,768
But it's massive.

353
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,230
<i>Even if the five of us push
to consume a kilogram each day,</i>

354
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,357
<i>it'll still take us
over a decade to finish it all.</i>

355
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,777
Do you honestly think
I can handle eating a kilogram?

356
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,614
And considering Falin's condition,
we definitely don't have time for that.

357
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,368
So, just ask others to help.

358
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,205
It's time to make full use
of the connections you've built.

359
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,874
You're banking on my connections for this?

360
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,252
It's not like you're without any.

361
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,212
Can't you think of anyone?

362
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,382
<i>The orcs.</i>

363
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,134
<i>They'll likely eat a fair amount
and seem like a promising choice.</i>

364
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,303
<i>The inhabitants of the Golden Castle.</i>

365
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,014
<i>They might not have
the heartiest appetite,</i>

366
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,642
<i>but their numbers and livestock
can compensate for that.</i>

367
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,353
<i>Then there's Namari, Shuro,
and their groups.</i>

368
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,897
<i>Those two will lend a hand
if we appeal to their emotions.</i>

369
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,276
<i>And Kabru seemed interested
in trying monster food.</i>

370
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,904
That's all I can come up with
at the moment.

371
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,031
That's quite a list.

372
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,158
But we're hardly enough
to consume the entire dragon.

373
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,953
I wish we could also have another troop.

374
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,329
But at least

375
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,332
we've got clear goals now.

376
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:38,171
<i>First, we release the Winged Lion
from the heart of the dungeon.</i>

377
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,172
<i>Second,</i>

378
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,176
<i>with the Lion's aid, we neutralize
the lunatic magician's power.</i>

379
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,177
<i>Third,</i>

380
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,515
<i>we recruit people to assist us
in consuming Falin's dragon parts.</i>

381
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,351
I'm suddenly
feeling optimistic about this.

382
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,313
It's going to be one extravagant feast.

383
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,065
There are no troops inside the dungeon.

384
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,736
What's this sickening feeling?

385
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,947
The air in the dungeon is stale.

386
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:07,617
While you guys were inside,
it underwent another big transformation.

387
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,036
A transformation?

388
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,662
You'll get it once you see it.

389
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,458
Well, it's going to be
an unpleasant transformation

390
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,626
for the folks behind us, at least.

391
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,722
Don't eat stuff like that!

392
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,851
What's all this racket?

393
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,229
{\an8}<i>Walking Mushrooms.</i>

394
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,441
{\an8}How about using them
as a garnish for a steak

395
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,359
{\an8}made from Falin's dragon parts?

396
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,987
{\an8}Or should we make a stew instead?

397
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,114
{\an8}-The broth from the bones--
-Stop it!

398
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:49,076
{\an8}Now's not the time
to be planning Falin menus!

399
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,119
I'm hungry.

400
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,997
Shall we prepare something?

401
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,373
I second that!

402
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,375
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

403
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,836
<i>Eat or be eaten.</i>

404
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,255
<i>There is no hierarchy.</i>

405
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,134
<i>Eating is a privilege for those who live.</i>

406
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,804
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

407
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,473
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>

408
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,859
