1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,726
Really, though.

3
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:45,522
There's nothing more horrifying
than black magic.

4
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:49,067
Was bringing this person back
worth going down that path?

5
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,569
It's only natural for Shuro to be furious.

6
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,490
Using shady methods
like that to resurrect someone?

7
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,325
That's just risky.

8
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,036
{\an8}Letting her stay dead
would've been better for her--

9
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,079
{\an8}Enough!

10
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,165
I understand your point,

11
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,501
so please stop.

12
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,547
Sorry.

13
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,509
Shuro, deep down, you probably know

14
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:19,472
that if you were in his shoes,
you'd have done the same thing.

15
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,807
I know that!

16
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,852
But his attitude is just too much!

17
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,895
We fed on monsters!

18
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,523
I think my favorite is the Red Dragon
because of the memories.

19
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,441
Check this out! It's a monster sword!

20
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:34,279
{\an8}We may have used black magic,
but you won't tell anyone, right?

21
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,159
{\an8}Anyway, I have no idea
what's going on in your head.

22
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,703
{\an8}I doubt I'll ever understand.

23
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:43,705
{\an8}So I can't help you.

24
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,707
Laios! Senshi!

25
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,375
We've got trouble!

26
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,587
A group of monsters
is attacking the cooking crew and…

27
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,381
{\an8}What have you done?

28
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,593
{\an8}I told him everything
that's happened so far.

29
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,595
Everything?!

30
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,763
I thought that Shuro would understand.

31
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,765
Shuro's the last person
you should have told!

32
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,683
I figured.

33
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,268
Is this on me?

34
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,729
Did I make the wrong call?

35
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,106
Don't beat yourself up.

36
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,233
He's just a little tired.

37
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,696
<i>I have a lot of respect for him.</i>

38
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:20,491
<i>He's helped me out countless times
on our adventures.</i>

39
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,245
<i>He told me tales of foreign lands</i>

40
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,873
<i>when all I've known
was my homeland and this island.</i>

41
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:30,501
<i>Shuro's always been cool-headed and smart.</i>

42
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,214
For him to explode like that,

43
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,008
I must've really messed up.

44
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,929
It'd be a shame
if our friendship ended like this…

45
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:49,771
Harpies.

46
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,276
This is getting us nowhere.

47
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,194
Asebi!

48
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:57,487
Let's go, you three!

49
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:04,702
Laios told Shuro everything
that's happened so far.

50
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,038
What? Is that why the air is so tense?

51
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,165
Shuro's furious.

52
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,166
What do we do?

53
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,960
If the story gets to the surface, we…

54
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,963
I know! I know, but…

55
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:19,467
It looks like the ninjas
are handling things just fine.

56
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,136
{\an8}Anyway, who else knows?

57
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,388
{\an8}Four people for now.

58
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:25,556
{\an8}Shuro and two of his retainers,

59
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,226
{\an8}and that curly-haired guy.

60
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,732
He's the guy whose party
was wiped out by Treasure Bugs, right?

61
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,026
What's he doing here?

62
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,194
Who knows?

63
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,864
Maybe he's after
whoever stole their loot and food.

64
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,200
W-We have to clear that up!

65
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,121
The loot was just Treasure Bugs
and the food was drenched and ruined!

66
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,580
You idiot!

67
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,208
The bigger problem
is your use of black magic.

68
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,919
Shuro is angry, but he's not a concern.

69
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,840
He's just ticked off
we put Falin in danger.

70
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,301
{\an8}But I'm not sure about the others.

71
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:06,222
{\an8}By the way, how much evidence
is left of you using black magic?

72
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,643
The magic circle
got erased by the Cleaners,

73
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,231
but there might be trouble if they check
Falin's body and my staff too closely.

74
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,358
We need to torch your staff right now!

75
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,526
Wait a minute!

76
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:22,071
If they're already onto us that much,
burning my staff won't make a difference.

77
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,948
Huh?

78
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,493
Over there, look!

79
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,956
What's that monster?

80
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,999
A Harpy?

81
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,375
No.

82
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,062
What?

83
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,021
No.

84
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,522
No.

85
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,523
How?

86
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,525
Falin…

87
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:02,904
It can't be.

88
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,948
No.

89
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,910
{\an8}What on earth?

90
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,542
<i>It's so cool!</i>

91
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,838
<i>But it's a little too greedy.</i>

92
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,299
<i>It's got wings, feathers, and scales too.</i>

93
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:24,258
Falin!

94
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,344
Do you recognize me?

95
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,804
Knock it off, Marcille!

96
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,055
Falin!

97
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,392
-Holm! Rin! Prepare for battle!
-Falin!

98
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,310
-R-Right!
-Right.

99
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,646
-Laios, Shuro! What's the plan?
-Falin!

100
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,772
Tell us what to do!

101
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:40,149
Inutade, don't hurt her!

102
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,651
Try to restrain her!

103
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,152
Uh. Huh?

104
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,488
No, Young Master. Run--

105
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:07,718
So, I need to restrain her.

106
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,595
Restrain her without hurting her.

107
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,180
Restrain her without hurting her?

108
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,612
Can you do it, Holm?

109
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,905
Y-Yeah.

110
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,324
All right.

111
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:31,242
Come out.

112
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,057
Falin!

113
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,934
A-An Undine?

114
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,769
Are you controlling that?

115
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,313
Please make it stop!

116
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,398
She's just confused.

117
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,193
Give me a break.

118
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:08,070
You don't care how many people die

119
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,656
if you can protect someone
dear to you, is that it?

120
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,659
That thing isn't "her."

121
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,536
It's just a monster!

122
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:22,043
<i>Ludeloes Arnbite.</i>

123
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,552
Oh, Marillier…

124
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,221
It can even cast spells?

125
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,111
No, Kuro!

126
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,613
Don't, you fool! Stay hidden!

127
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,617
Falin…

128
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,582
Out of my way!

129
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,335
<i>Andarses Orbis!</i>

130
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,811
<i>Monsters are dangerous.</i>

131
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,146
<i>Damn it, Kensuke!</i>

132
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,106
<i>Never trust a monster…</i>

133
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,695
Forgive me, Falin.

134
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,365
I wish I could've
switched places with you.

135
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,376
{\an8}My big brother, Laios.

136
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,680
Falin!

137
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,640
The lungs, kidneys,

138
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,517
and the heart!

139
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,363
<i>I'm going to die.</i>

140
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,576
Can you stand?

141
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,620
I'm sorry I hesitated.

142
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,580
You're right.

143
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:24,206
My sister's soul

144
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,251
is probably under the control
of the lord of the dungeon now.

145
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,048
But if we kill her,
the lunatic magician will show up again.

146
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,634
For now, we need to get out of here.

147
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,177
But--

148
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,271
Falin!

149
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,274
Hey!

150
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,322
You monster!

151
00:10:56,405 --> 00:11:00,117
<i>Ludeloes Ejectulm Hemtum.</i>

152
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,078
This spell…

153
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,080
Everyone, stay close to me!

154
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,171
Essiet!

155
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,201
She might return.

156
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,120
Let's get the wounded inside the barrier.

157
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,163
And the dead…

158
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,832
What should we do?

159
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,459
I'll resurrect them.

160
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,628
I can't revive everyone, though.

161
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,464
Should I gather the bodies?

162
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,800
No, don't move them.

163
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,386
We can't waste a drop of shed blood.

164
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,433
Where's the monster?!

165
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,726
It bolted. We're safe now.

166
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,478
Who's next?

167
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,396
Wait.

168
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,481
Bring back that woman first.

169
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:15,985
Why me?

170
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,905
{\an8}You seemed to be a powerful mage.

171
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,825
{\an8}So I thought you could use
healing and resurrection magic.

172
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,162
{\an8}He can't heal everyone alone.

173
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:30,332
{\an8}You helped us get here,
so this is the least we can do.

174
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,667
{\an8}So now I owe you.

175
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,836
My guess is
you're after a different spell.

176
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:35,838
Never mind.

177
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,173
Let us get this done quickly.

178
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,259
Um, I can use
basic resurrection magic too.

179
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,177
No.

180
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,471
Don't you lay a finger on them.

181
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:47,224
I can't let you use any more black magic.

182
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,977
I-I wouldn't do that.

183
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,562
Then what was that?

184
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,606
Why did she look like that?

185
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,942
It's because you used the Dragon's flesh
and black magic on her!

186
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,986
No! That can't be!

187
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,071
The magic didn't have that kind of power.

188
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,658
{\an8}B-But it's possible that

189
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:08,496
{\an8}the Red Dragon's soul
was under some spell.

190
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,248
And Falin's soul merged with the Dragon's,

191
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,126
and the lunatic magician
transformed her into that creature.

192
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,337
Shuro?

193
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,422
{\an8}I'm handing Marcille over
to the elves of the west.

194
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,383
I can't kill that thing.

195
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,719
But I can't let it roam free either.

196
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:27,473
I want to free her soul from the dungeon

197
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,642
and let her rest in peace at least.

198
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,477
But…

199
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,687
The elves will know how to do that.

200
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,733
{\an8}Confess everything
to the elves of the west.

201
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,401
No, Shuro.

202
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,237
There has to be another way.

203
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,571
Give me a break!

204
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,740
What have you been doing until now?

205
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,617
Another way?

206
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,743
What's your plan?

207
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,787
Are you going to keep resurrecting her

208
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,414
with different monster parts
until she's back to normal?

209
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,458
Go on, tell me!

210
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,710
What are you going to do?

211
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,462
You have an idea, don't you?

212
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,838
Tell me!

213
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,638
We'll defeat the lunatic magician!

214
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:12,101
That Red Dragon
was clearly following orders.

215
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:16,063
Who else but the magician who created
this dungeon could command it?

216
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:20,317
So, we'll take down the magician
and rewrite his orders!

217
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,028
I'm not familiar with this sort of thing,

218
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,447
but Marcille should know how!

219
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,241
That's why I won't let you take her!

220
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,910
I've had enough!

221
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:34,290
{\an8}Are you really going to use black magic
to fix a problem caused by black magic?

222
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,709
{\an8}Why don't you start
taking things seriously for once?

223
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,050
Uh… sorr--

224
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:56,478
It's true I'm not the most skilled,

225
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,064
and you're stronger than most adventurers.

226
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,943
But here's what I know.

227
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,821
We've been getting
proper meals three times a day

228
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,448
and good sleep too.

229
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,241
That makes us more serious than you!

230
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,285
Listen to me!

231
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:16,665
We will take down the lunatic magician
and rescue Falin, no matter what!

232
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,335
Shuro, you go back to the surface.

233
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,338
Eat, bathe, and rest!

234
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,551
{\an8}Huh? What was that?

235
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,805
Shut up!

236
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,060
The fight isn't over yet.

237
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:39,813
If that's your plan, I have one of my own.

238
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,856
Plan?

239
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,317
Laios!

240
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,443
Listen up.

241
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,403
For a long time now,

242
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,615
I couldn't stand your guts.

243
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,118
Because you were thoughtless, dense,

244
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,578
<i>and always had the worst timing!</i>

245
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,497
Hey, tell me more
about those foreign lands!

246
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,916
Are you two eating together? Count me in!

247
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,043
We're friends now, right?

248
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,213
<i>It was even worse
because you meant no harm!</i>

249
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,507
Why don't I just end you here,

250
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,841
take Marcille, and--

251
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,551
Well, you should've told me sooner!

252
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,553
Why were you keeping quiet until now

253
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,599
if you couldn't stand me and thought
I was dense and had terrible timing?

254
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:19,103
{\an8}I was dropping hints
that most people would've picked up on!

255
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,481
You should've made
more of an effort to notice!

256
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,482
How could I?

257
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,986
You were the first friend
I made on this island,

258
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,780
and I was too excited to realize!

259
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,575
See, that's another thing
I can't stand about you!

260
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,661
You act all honest

261
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:37,788
but end up stressing people out!

262
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,290
How was I supposed to know?

263
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,210
You never speak up and you don't even eat!

264
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,505
What's the point of having a mouth?

265
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,257
Shut up, you moron!

266
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,552
You haven't put in
half the effort Marcille has.

267
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,762
We don't have time for this.

268
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,597
It's a childish squabble.

269
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,350
I must have raised him wrong.

270
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,478
Seven dead, including myself,

271
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,189
one in critical condition,
and three missing.

272
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,610
The gnome and I will resurrect them,
but we're low on blood.

273
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,239
Senshi, can you gather
the scattered ingredients?

274
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,866
Sure.

275
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,535
I can use basic resurrection magic too.

276
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,412
You stay out of this.

277
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,002
Heal the wounded and find the missing.

278
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,671
If you try anything suspicious,
I'll cut you down on the spot.

279
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,782
See, Shuro?

280
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,202
Right now, I'm better fed than you are.

281
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,536
That's why I'm stronger!

282
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,330
D-Damn it.

283
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,678
It's good.

284
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:20,432
Young Master, we've resurrected everyone.

285
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,102
When do you wish to depart?

286
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,064
No, prepare the return magic.

287
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,148
We're heading back up.

288
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,983
Are you sure?

289
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,820
Asebi is still missing.

290
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,029
She probably ran off.

291
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:34,947
Let her be.

292
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,659
Please forgive our inadequacy.

293
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,077
No.

294
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,454
You did your best.

295
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,456
Thank you.

296
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,542
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

297
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,965
I'm returning to my homeland.

298
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,926
I'll never set foot on this island again.

299
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,305
I'll report what happened
to the Lord of the Island.

300
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,474
I see.

301
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,644
I wish I could've returned with Falin.

302
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,730
What was her answer to your proposal?

303
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,731
I don't know.

304
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,360
She said she needed time
to think about it.

305
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,487
I was waiting for her answer.

306
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,748
<i>There's no woman
more fascinating than her.</i>

307
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,587
<i>I loved her voice, the way she thought,</i>

308
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,673
<i>and her smile.</i>

309
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,972
But I never actually
brought any of this up with her.

310
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,267
I wish I had told her sooner.

311
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,146
{\an8}Wait, so he just popped
the question out of nowhere?

312
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,397
{\an8}That's scary.

313
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,191
{\an8}From where he comes from, it's normal.

314
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,777
I see. Well, I'll pass on
your words to Falin.

315
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,783
That's the part about you

316
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,120
that I envy.

317
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,668
Kabru, you were a big help.

318
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,086
I didn't do much.

319
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,005
My attack ended up being useless.

320
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,841
No, it helped me notice
a couple of things.

321
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,176
Like what?

322
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,262
The places you stabbed
would've been fatal for a human,

323
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,181
but not for my sister.

324
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:27,643
This means either that
she doesn't have vital organs there,

325
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,394
or she has more somewhere else.

326
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:34,858
A bunch of monsters like the Basilisk,
Cerberus, and Scylla have multiple brains.

327
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,152
It's pretty common in Chimera types.

328
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,988
<i>His pupils are dilated.</i>

329
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,241
<i>He must really love monsters.</i>

330
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,660
<i>So his knowledge is his weapon.</i>

331
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:47,412
<i>He says he'll defeat the lunatic magician.</i>

332
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,874
<i>There are plenty of adventurers
more skilled than him,</i>

333
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,044
<i>but none with his level
of knowledge and motivation.</i>

334
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,422
<i>This guy might just pull it off.</i>

335
00:20:58,924 --> 00:20:59,800
<i>But</i>

336
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,011
<i>what happens after he defeats
the lord of the dungeon?</i>

337
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,389
<i>They say whoever
takes down the lunatic magician</i>

338
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,808
<i>will gain everything in the kingdom.</i>

339
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:13,105
<i>What if that means becoming
the next lord of the dungeon?</i>

340
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:18,652
<i>What will he do with this city built
by black magic and all its monsters</i>

341
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,070
<i>when he inherits them?</i>

342
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,198
<i>Will he quietly seal the dungeon?</i>

343
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,659
Aren't you hungry?

344
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,743
Huh?

345
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:45,595
HARPY EGG OMELET

346
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,265
What's this?

347
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:50,684
It's an omelet made from a Harpy egg.

348
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,147
Senshi found an egg earlier.

349
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,482
You seemed interested in monster cuisine,

350
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,067
so have one.

351
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,073
<i>Mother!</i>

352
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,576
<i>I'd rather die than eat it!</i>

353
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,911
<i>What do I do? How do I get out of this?</i>

354
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,040
<i>No, maybe I have no choice
but to kill him now.</i>

355
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,624
<i>Not now!</i>

356
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,709
I'll try one!

357
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,044
<i>Typical of Kabru.</i>

358
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,422
<i>He'll do anything to win someone's favor.</i>

359
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,049
<i>What a nice guy.</i>

360
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:37,564
The return magic is ready.

361
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,233
No one is injured, yes?

362
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,693
Beyond this portal is the surface.

363
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,487
If you die there, we can't bring you back.

364
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,405
To be honest,

365
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:49,367
I think you'll die before you
even get to the lunatic magician.

366
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,995
But if you do manage to survive,

367
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,749
but can't make it back to the surface
because of black magic,

368
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,001
ring this bell.

369
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,254
It'll resonate with its twin far away.

370
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,509
I'll send an escort
to help you flee to the east.

371
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,303
Don't die.

372
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:10,764
Thanks.

373
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,642
Laios,

374
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,393
I'm glad we got to chat.

375
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,270
That was the highlight
of this trip for me.

376
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,772
The pleasure is mine.

377
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,398
Um…

378
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,733
Quickly now.

379
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,611
You remember my name now, right?

380
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,363
Huh? Of course.

381
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,739
Good.

382
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,243
Don't forget next time.

383
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,246
Well, see you.

384
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,373
<i>Next time?</i>

385
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,167
Let's go, Laios!

386
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,461
There's no turning back now.

387
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,172
{\an8}Crap. See?

388
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,342
{\an8}I just knew this was going
to happen in the end.

389
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:48,301
{\an8}Crap!

390
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,387
{\an8}That's vulgar, Chil.

391
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,055
I'm sorry.

392
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,102
It'll all work out somehow.

393
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,862
