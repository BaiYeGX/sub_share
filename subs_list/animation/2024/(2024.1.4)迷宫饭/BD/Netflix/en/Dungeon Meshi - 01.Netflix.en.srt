00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,003
ORIGINAL WORK BY RYOKO KUI

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,964
<i>It all started in a small village.</i>

3
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:11,720
<i>One day, a rumble in the ground
caused a rift under the cemetery,</i>

4
00:00:11,803 --> 00:00:14,556
<i>from which a single man appeared.</i>

5
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:19,310
<i>He claimed to be the king
of a once prosperous kingdom.</i>

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,856
<i>He states that the once glorious land</i>

7
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:25,817
<i>continues to be held captive
deep underground</i>

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,570
<i>by the hands of a mad magician.</i>

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,489
<i>To whomever defeats this magician,</i>

10
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,742
<i>he offers everything his kingdom has.</i>

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:38,663
<i>After he imparts these words,
he turns to dust and vanishes.</i>

12
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:47,964
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

13
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,185
Keep it up, everyone.

14
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,103
We've only got a bit left
after this dragon.

15
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,105
Let's go!

16
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,857
<i>We're completely prepared.</i>

17
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,109
<i>Nothing can get in our way.</i>

18
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,699
<i>That's not true.</i>

19
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,452
<i>We're hungry.</i>

20
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,207
<i>Everyone's movements lack
their usual edge.</i>

21
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:27,045
<i>We lost a day roaming around
due to a misprint on our map.</i>

22
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:30,340
<i>We walked into a trap
and lost three days' worth of food.</i>

23
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:39,724
<i>It's bothersome, but we should turn back
for a bit after defeating the dragon.</i>

24
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,934
Laios!

25
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,685
<i>What happened, Falin?</i>

26
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,938
<i>Did they cast a confusion spell on you?</i>

27
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,441
<i>Wh…</i>

28
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:51,986
<i>What?</i>

29
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,447
<i>You're kidding me.</i>

30
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,201
<i>We're all dead?
We're so deep in the dungeon.</i>

31
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,205
R-Run.

32
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,093
Laios.

33
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,557
You're awake.

34
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:25,145
{\an8}It looks like a magic spell
got us out of the dungeon,

35
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,106
but Falin's the only one we can't find.

36
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,944
She was eaten.

37
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:33,945
What?

38
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,157
Her magic didn't work
from inside the dragon's stomach.

39
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,617
That can't be.

40
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,327
She's probably still in the dungeon.

41
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,912
Let's go now to save her.

42
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,914
Hold on.

43
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,795
Honestly, it looks like almost everything
we had was left behind in the dungeon.

44
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,881
So we're basically cleaned out.

45
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,215
What?

46
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,092
And what's worse…

47
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,218
Chilchuck?

48
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,221
We just lost two of our party members.

49
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:01,306
RESIGNATION LETTER

50
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,223
What's that?

51
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:06,311
Apparently another party's
been courting them for a while now.

52
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,729
What?

53
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,732
<i>Exploring dungeons costs money</i>

54
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:14,736
<i>for hiring companions,
buying equipment, and getting food too.</i>

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,198
<i>We can sell our current equipment
and secure what funds we have now</i>

56
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,576
<i>to switch to cheaper equipment.</i>

57
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:26,247
<i>As well as to pay for food, medicine,
necessities, and new companions.</i>

58
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,750
-Do we have enough?
-Not in the slightest.

59
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,879
{\an8}My little sister will get digested
while we get everything ready.

60
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,216
There's that person who once revived
someone from shreds, right?

61
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,635
Have they ever revived someone from poop?

62
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,471
Never heard of that.

63
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,809
I know we're short on cash,

64
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,603
but how about some food first?

65
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:52,106
After all, our empty stomachs
may have been why we failed.

66
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,984
What should we eat?

67
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,488
For cheap food, we could go to
the bistro on the main street,

68
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,907
or there's The Laughing Wolf
for bigger meals.

69
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,910
Oh, but that pub's hard to pass up too!

70
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,038
Their soup dumplings are to die for.

71
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,665
-No.
-What?

72
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,334
We need to get back to the dungeon.

73
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,752
But as we are now…

74
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,545
I have an idea.

75
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,799
-You two will leave the party.
-What?

76
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:21,928
Then, we'll sell your equipment
and I'll enter the dungeon alone.

77
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,346
That's insane.

78
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,430
Do you have a death wish?

79
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,226
This way, we won't have to compromise
on using quality equipment,

80
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:31,688
and I can get to the lowest floor
while avoiding monsters if I'm alone.

81
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,690
It's not impossible.

82
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,942
It's all my fault in the first place.

83
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:38,736
I can't put you two in danger too.

84
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,533
I'm going too, no matter what.

85
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,827
I'll do anything to save Falin.

86
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,037
Falin is dear to me too.

87
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,624
I won't drag you down.

88
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,544
You know how strong my magic is.

89
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:57,547
Don't forget about my job, too.

90
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:01,175
You'll need me to open doors
and disable traps.

91
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,927
You guys…

92
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,183
You really mean to go with me, right?

93
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,185
For better or for worse?

94
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,771
Y-Yeah.

95
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,942
We'll secure food from within the dungeon.

96
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:18,943
-What?!
-What?!

97
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,738
There are more than enough
monsters in the dungeon.

98
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,949
That means an entire ecosystem
exists inside.

99
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:28,995
Carnivorous monsters will have
herbivorous monsters to feed on,

100
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,205
and the herbivorous monsters eat plants

101
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,958
that find nutrients
from water, sunlight, and dirt.

102
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:38,212
In other words,
humans can eat in the dungeon too.

103
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,842
So, what you're saying

104
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,844
is that we'll eat monsters?

105
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,804
We'll eat monsters too.

106
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,098
Think about our adventures until now.

107
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,602
I'm sure there were
a lot of tasty-looking things.

108
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,980
No, there's no way I'm eating those.

109
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,358
There are quite a bit of people
who hunt monsters for food.

110
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,653
You mean the criminals
who can't come back on land?

111
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:06,115
Even they get hospitalized
all the time from food poisoning.

112
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:09,368
You said you'd do anything to save Falin.

113
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,120
I never said I'd eat monsters.

114
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,207
{\an8}There's no time nor money.
What other choice do we have?

115
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,334
{\an8}But there's no point
if we eat something weird

116
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,711
{\an8}and get stopped by food poisoning.

117
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,756
Run away!

118
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,134
Save us!

119
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,680
Looks like dungeon newbies.

120
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,185
They're not cut out for this
if they can't handle a monster like this.

121
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:37,188
Hey, Laios?

122
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,941
Let's make lunch out of this.

123
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,818
I refuse!

124
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,570
No, absolutely not!

125
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,698
Isn't going straight to mushrooms
a bit risky?

126
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:52,578
The dungeon food guide
says it's food suited for beginners.

127
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,414
It's meaty and has a mild taste.

128
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,042
-What is this book?
-It looks pretty worn down.

129
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,337
Let's go find more space
to start a fire.

130
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,881
Wish we had one or two
more ingredients, though.

131
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,178
Those steps are from a Huge Scorpion!

132
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,597
Could it be that he…

133
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,684
<i>Despite being a dungeon,
many people come and go,</i>

134
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,186
<i>making it a bustling place
for adventurers and merchants.</i>

135
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,272
{\an8}<i>A former cemetery,</i>

136
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,358
{\an8}<i>it was once a sacred place
where villagers slept in peace.</i>

137
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,736
<i>But once it was connected to
the dungeon six years ago,</i>

138
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,823
<i>it became the liveliest place
in the village.</i>

139
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,994
<i>They say monsters emerge
from the depths of the dungeon.</i>

140
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:37,123
<i>It is unclear whether a forbidden spell
transformed terrestrial creatures</i>

141
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,501
<i>or if they were summoned
from the world of monsters.</i>

142
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,421
<i>But they all have an odd appearance</i>

143
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,340
<i>and attack humans as if
they have something to protect.</i>

144
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:50,136
<i>But that served as the only proof we have</i>

145
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,514
<i>that the cursed,
formerly prosperous capital truly exists.</i>

146
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,059
Don't kill it like a crayfish.

147
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,605
This is how you catch it,
so it's easier than a crayfish.

148
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,772
Hey.

149
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:07,069
You've been looking for a chance
to eat monsters for a while, haven't you?

150
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,200
But that doesn't change the fact
that I want to save my sister.

151
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,659
Yeah, okay.

152
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,288
I've never told you this,
but I love monsters.

153
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,666
from their appearance and cries
to their ecology.

154
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,085
I soon wanted to know their taste.

155
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,253
He's a psychopath.

156
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,262
Shouldn't we do this
where there are fewer people?

157
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,557
It's hard to go back and forth for water.

158
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,977
So, how do we eat these?

159
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,063
Let's try an orthodox approach.

160
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,316
What's wrong?

161
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,819
It's easy to cut from above,
but there's resistance from the side.

162
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,030
When we fight against
mushroom-type monsters,

163
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,908
slashing diagonally or horizontally
might be less effective.

164
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,826
That's good to know.

165
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,788
It looks like food if you slice it up.

166
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,705
I don't see it.

167
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,834
Hey, hold on!

168
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,380
We're eating it as is?
What about the venom?

169
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,007
This scorpion's venom is safe to eat.

170
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,635
Really?

171
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,221
That's what the book said,
so I want to try it.

172
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,474
Blech.

173
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,685
Told you.

174
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:21,852
Hold it right there.

175
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,897
Scorpion Hot Pot, eh?

176
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:27,858
But that method leaves much to be desired.

177
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,068
Who are you?

178
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,529
When you eat this monster,

179
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:35,866
you must cut off
the pincers, head, and legs.

180
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,369
The tail will upset your stomach.

181
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:41,330
The book said it'd be fine.

182
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,374
Or rather it just tastes bad.

183
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:46,127
Also, cut up the body as well.

184
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:50,381
It'll cook through more easily,
and the juices create a delicious broth.

185
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:52,383
It's easier to eat too.

186
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,885
And take out the internal organs.

187
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,887
They're bitter and have an awful texture.

188
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,431
As for the Walking Mushroom,

189
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:01,475
throw out the bottom
and three centimeters from the surface.

190
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,519
The feet are tasty, so keep those.

191
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,396
The feet are tasty?

192
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,608
Yeah, they have
a nice, unique smell, right?

193
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,276
<i>The smell of the feet, huh?</i>

194
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,528
This pot is too small.

195
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,488
Let's use mine.

196
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,033
You sure are prepared.

197
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,870
It feels like it's missing something.

198
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,585
Here.

199
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,503
Wait, there's no way I'll eat that.

200
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,298
-Marcille?
-Not in a million years.

201
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,924
This is a cemetery, you know.

202
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,926
Even if I'm okay with monsters,

203
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,179
plants with roots are out of the question.

204
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,640
Doesn't it look
good enough with just this?

205
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,850
-Marcille!
-And who the hell are you?

206
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,477
-Look up!
-What?

207
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,400
A Slime!

208
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,903
<i>Dammit, it's covering my face.</i>

209
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,906
<i>Oh no, I can't cast any spells.</i>

210
00:10:56,989 --> 00:11:00,910
<i>Thinking back,
my first death was to a Slime.</i>

211
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,001
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

212
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,628
It got in my nose, though.

213
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,046
Blow it out.

214
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,257
You got rid of a Slime with just a knife?

215
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,802
It's simple if you know its composition.

216
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,096
They may look amorphous,

217
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,890
but their composition is actually
more structured than humans.

218
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,769
This is the inside of a Slime.

219
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,397
Compared to humans,
the stomach is flipped

220
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,067
and covers its internal organs and head
with digestive fluids.

221
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,946
It senses the breathing of its prey
and springs into action.

222
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,700
So you're an easier target
if you shout in a loud voice.

223
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,245
It's not edible like this,

224
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:48,040
but you can add citrus juice,
and wash it thoroughly in hot water.

225
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,750
Then, wipe off the moisture

226
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:53,462
or rub it in salt and dry it in the sun.

227
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,464
This makes a delicious delicacy.

228
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,009
If possible, it's best to
let it fast for two weeks.

229
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,470
Drying it takes time too.

230
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,974
This is a portable Slime drying net
that I made myself.

231
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,976
Sandwich it like this

232
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,520
and it dries as you walk around.

233
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,189
It takes time until it's ready,

234
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,608
but here's the final product.

235
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,111
Let's add this for today.

236
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,489
-But isn't it a delicacy?
-It's fine.

237
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:25,703
I've researched monster food
in this dungeon for over ten years.

238
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:30,249
Nothing makes me happier than to hear
someone is interested in Monster cuisine.

239
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,625
Ten years?

240
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,253
Was the dungeon here that long?

241
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,505
Well, sit tight.

242
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,484
{\an8}It's ready.

243
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,277
{\an8}HUGE SCORPION
AND WALKING MUSHROOM HOT POT

244
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,617
Boiled Huge Scorpions turn red, huh?

245
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,077
It feels so different seeing it in person.

246
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,164
It smells kind of delicious.

247
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,000
The meat contracts when cooked,

248
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,793
so it comes apart easily.

249
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,795
You're right.

250
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:20,799
This is delicious!

251
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,927
Isn't it?

252
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,304
It tastes so different
based on how you cook it.

253
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,348
Right?

254
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:29,308
It's so good! I'm shocked!

255
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,310
Right?!

256
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,565
Give me some too.

257
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,693
What is this?

258
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,029
Dried Slime innards.

259
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,325
It's good!

260
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:49,453
So, this is how you eat Slimes?

261
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,373
It also tastes good soaked in fruit juice.

262
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,417
And these tree roots
are so nice and fluffy.

263
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,253
They're not technically roots.

264
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,589
They're tree trunks
that grow upside down in the dungeon.

265
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,092
This algae is so soft and tasty.

266
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,803
Does this grow in the dungeon too?

267
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,223
That's just normal algae
that grows in humid places.

268
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:13,227
I can't believe all this is from
the dungeon we've been walking through.

269
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,109
I'm stuffed.

270
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,819
We still haven't heard your name.

271
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,405
My name is Senshi.

272
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,824
It means "researcher" in Dwarvish.

273
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:28,826
I'm Laios.

274
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:31,745
That's Marcille the magic-user
and Chilchuck the picklock.

275
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,832
Looks like you're on a mission.

276
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,375
Yes, that's right.

277
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,588
{\an8}One of our companions got eaten
by a monster in the lower levels.

278
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,257
{\an8}We want to save her
before she gets digested.

279
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,136
By a monster? What kind?

280
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,971
A dragon with deep-red scales.

281
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,099
Deep-red scales?

282
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,143
The Red Dragon?

283
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,854
<i>To maintain their large bodies,</i>

284
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,772
<i>dragons spend most of their days sleeping.</i>

285
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,901
They also digest
much more slowly than other monsters.

286
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,153
I hope so.

287
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,654
Please.

288
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,782
Would you allow me to accompany you?

289
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:10,659
You're more than welcome to.

290
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,162
It'd be a huge help to us as well.

291
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,664
Really?

292
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,417
-Thank you.
-Likewise.

293
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,421
I've dreamt of cooking
the Red Dragon for many years.

294
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,465
The Red Dragon.

295
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,677
Maybe I should go for the traditional
steak, or perhaps a burger.

296
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,930
Shabu-shabu is great too.

297
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,433
No, if I have eggs,
a Dragon and Egg bowl would be good.

298
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,189
<i>Is it okay to eat that?</i>

299
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,486
<i>It was on everyone's mind,
but no one said a word.</i>

300
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,950
<i>Second basement floor.</i>

301
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,453
<i>Unlike the cemetery
on the first basement floor,</i>

302
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:57,456
<i>an abnormal view spreads out before them.</i>

303
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,291
<i>According to academics,</i>

304
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,963
<i>this is the spire of the Golden Castle,
which is located deep underground.</i>

305
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,674
I've always wondered about this,

306
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,969
but how do those trees
not go above ground at this height?

307
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:12,554
Well, a curse made this dungeon.

308
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,475
Marcille, are you okay?

309
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,436
I tripped on a gap in the bridge.

310
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,980
We've walked quite a way.

311
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,564
You must be tired.

312
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:25,651
Let's find a campsite
and stop early for today.

313
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,614
We spent a night
in a hollow tree here before, didn't we?

314
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,740
Yeah, we did.

315
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,244
I burned myself trying to make pork soup.

316
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,162
Soup…

317
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,872
Are you hungry?

318
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,001
I have some scorpion broth
from lunch today.

319
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,252
I don't want it.

320
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,920
Well, then.

321
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,006
Let's go hunt a monster for dinner.

322
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,008
Jeez.

323
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,136
-What're you in the mood for?
-What?

324
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,264
I'll do my best to match your request.

325
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,141
You say that, but…

326
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,186
We're eating monsters, right?

327
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,150
Ugh, I'm fine with anything
as long as it's edible.

328
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,028
What kind of monsters live around here?

329
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,030
Let's see…

330
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,532
Big Bats and Giant Rats.

331
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,659
I don't want anything unsanitary.

332
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,660
Forest Goblins.

333
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:18,287
Demi-humans are a no-go.

334
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,413
Living Armor.

335
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,457
Metal?

336
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:25,294
Isn't there anything more normal,
like birds or tree fruits?

337
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,920
There's always that one person

338
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,966
who shoots down every idea
after agreeing to eat anything.

339
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,302
I don't think I'm asking for much.

340
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,555
There are normal monsters,
but those don't attack humans,

341
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,307
so they'll require more preparation.

342
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:42,019
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

343
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,063
Sorry, that's true.

344
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,189
But you know,

345
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,650
we might run into a monster
holding a flesh-eating lunch.

346
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,070
Let's try to enjoy this!

347
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,447
Not very optimistic about this.

348
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,451
Well, there are lots of fruits
during this season.

349
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,453
Really?

350
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,455
Yeah.

351
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,461
See? I knew it'd be tree fruit
from Man-eating Plants.

352
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,505
Marcille, that's incorrect.

353
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,465
Man-eating Plants
are just the common name.

354
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,968
That flower, for example, is a Baraselia.

355
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,471
It mainly grows on monster trails

356
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,598
shooting out a mucus
reminiscent of spider webs.

357
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:22,226
When a creature touches the mucus,
it reflexively pulls them in.

358
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,730
It wraps around things that move,
but it doesn't digest them.

359
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,691
It makes them into compost.

360
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,736
But it sometimes
uses humans for nutrients, right?

361
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,447
The vegetables you usually eat

362
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:39,118
can be traced back to
dead remains and animal dung.

363
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,745
I can't fault that logic, but…

364
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,122
{\an8}It's fine.

365
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,957
{\an8}It's still only the second basement floor.

366
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,669
{\an8}Someone would notice
if a corpse rolled by here.

367
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:52,214
{\an8}They have people to retrieve corpses,

368
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,217
{\an8}and no one would get eaten
by a monster in a place like this.

369
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,386
You think so?

370
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,721
I don't think we can pluck them in secret.

371
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:02,641
We'll have to fight.

372
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,602
Move over.

373
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,939
I'll get rid of them in one shot.

374
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,442
<i>Sperae Yeptum Rufermus.</i>

375
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,404
<i>Alamandras Proju.</i>

376
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,531
<i>Nexant Aslam.</i>

377
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,158
Stop, you moron!

378
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,826
{\an8}Why?

379
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,708
Do you want the fruit
to get hit by your magic too?

380
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,211
Only take as much as you'll eat.
This rule is absolute.

381
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,589
This isn't the time for that!

382
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,466
No, let go of me!

383
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,682
They can't digest people?

384
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,601
But they're totally eating them!

385
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,687
What? Some of them
can digest things, though.

386
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,230
Depends on the plant type.

387
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,941
The one that has a hold of you

388
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,235
is a parasite type
that plants seeds inside your skin.

389
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,112
That's the worst kind!

390
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,740
Try to stay still, Marcille.

391
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,827
Plant-based monsters
basically have several limbs.

392
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,121
It'll take forever to fight them
one at a time.

393
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,540
For swords, there's only
one sure-fire spot.

394
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,500
The root.

395
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,881
Ouch…

396
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,716
Are you okay?

397
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,885
Yeah, thanks Laios.

398
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,262
-How was it?
-What?

399
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,183
This is Shadowtail, a plant-based parasite
that buries seeds

400
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,768
inside the skin of living creatures.

401
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:31,897
Unlike the Baraselia,
which is strong enough to break bones,

402
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,858
the Shadowtail needs to capture
its prey without killing them.

403
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,277
It uses a delicate balance,

404
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,281
immobilizing its prey
without making it uncomfortable.

405
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,785
I feel like it'd feel really good.
How did you feel?

406
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,914
I made her mad again.

407
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,792
Even I thought you were a bit much.

408
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,930
First, steam it lightly.

409
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,933
Cut around the stem in a circle.

410
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,271
Twist it a bit
and pull to get the seeds out.

411
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,690
-Wow.
-Peel the skin off,

412
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,192
beat the skin to make it soft,

413
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,945
and cover the pan with it.

414
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:25,284
Grind up the unripe fruit,
adding Slime and some scorpion broth,

415
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,452
mixing until it thickens.

416
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:30,664
Once it gets smooth,
add the rest of the scorpion broth

417
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,375
and chunks of tree fruit.

418
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,461
Mix it a bit
and pour it into the frying pan.

419
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,338
Cook it a bit.

420
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:40,716
I want to see if we can grow it
on the surface.

421
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,217
Of course, we can't.

422
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,802
No!

423
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,724
When it starts bubbling,
add the rest of the fruit.

424
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,226
All right.

425
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,103
It's done.

426
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:55,230
MAN-EATING PLANTS FRUIT TART

427
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,648
A tart?

428
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,233
At least, it looks like it.

429
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,278
The crust is just a non-stick coating.
You can leave it.

430
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,449
It's salt-flavored.
That's not what I expected.

431
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,992
Yeah, it's good.

432
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,954
Try it, Marcille. You'll probably like it.

433
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,666
None of the plants that ate people
are in it, right?

434
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,087
No, if we used
the gelatin from those plants,

435
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,715
it would've turned out even better.

436
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,759
The Slime didn't solidify well.

437
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,267
This is delicious.

438
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,103
The compost-type plants' fruit
is fresh and sweet.

439
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,272
The digestion-type plants'
is more compact and rich.

440
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,733
But I wonder if that's okay.

441
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:42,778
Doesn't that mean
they get eaten by other animals?

442
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,697
All this fruit they make gets taken away.

443
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,450
That's how a carnivorous plant works.

444
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,453
They use them to capture prey
for nourishment.

445
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,662
Oh, I see.

446
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,416
I wonder if this sweetness
is one of their tricks then.

447
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,502
Now I get it.

448
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:04,007
I'm so happy you're getting interested.

449
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,175
Stop that!

450
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,393
What'll we do with that corpse?

451
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,687
We don't have time
to go back to town.

452
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,440
Want me to revive it with magic?

453
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:23,652
No, there's a chance it won't work.

454
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,989
Maybe someone will take it
if we leave it in the open.

455
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,199
Yeah.

456
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,077
Let's make it visible.

457
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:36,206
I've seen this at execution sites.

458
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,546
<i>Marcille had a nightmare that night.</i>

459
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,632
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

460
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,551
<i>Eat or be eaten.</i>

461
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,387
<i>There is no hierarchy.</i>

462
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,807
<i>Eating is a privilege for those who live.</i>

463
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,976
<i>Dungeon food.</i>

464
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,478
<i>Oh, dungeon food.</i>

465
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:26,900
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

466
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,987
