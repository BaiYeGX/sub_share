1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,015
<i>I smell something good.</i>

3
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,313
Senshi?

4
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,904
There he is.

5
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,864
I see you woke up.

6
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:56,241
Good morning.

7
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,409
You made breakfast?

8
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,663
Senshi is a very fine cook.

9
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,373
He really is.

10
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,999
Senshi is amazing.

11
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,420
BREAKFAST PREPARED BY SENSHI

12
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,178
So good!

13
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,889
Yaad, would you like to try some?

14
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,976
But I can't taste…

15
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,144
Here.

16
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,988
It's warm and soft.

17
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,283
Your sense of taste is like a muscle.

18
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,994
If you don't use it, it weakens.

19
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,914
Start by savoring the texture.

20
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,999
Right.

21
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,709
Oh, look at you.

22
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,715
Long ago, every now and then,

23
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,759
I used to sit at the table like this
with my grandfather and parents.

24
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,679
<i>Always beside my grandfather
stood Thistle,</i>

25
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,974
<i>the lunatic magician.</i>

26
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,312
<i>My great-grandfather originally
welcomed him into the castle as a jester.</i>

27
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:11,274
<i>They say my grandfather and Thistle
were raised together like brothers.</i>

28
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:15,111
<i>When my grandfather ascended the throne,
he encouraged Thistle to study magic.</i>

29
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,196
<i>And Thistle began to distinguish himself.</i>

30
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,868
<i>Our realm was once abundant
with relics from dwarves and elves,</i>

31
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,787
<i>likely including items of black magic.</i>

32
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,833
<i>Thistle's thirst for power consumed him
and drove him toward madness.</i>

33
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,253
<i>Ultimately, he cast a spell of immortality
over the kingdom.</i>

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,215
I actually want to talk to him.

35
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,550
Where can I meet him?

36
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,093
Talk to him?

37
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,012
Absolutely not!

38
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,806
Having a conversation with him
is impossible.

39
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,227
<i>It was a struggle just to let
my grandfather slip away unnoticed.</i>

40
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,438
<i>Some were even put to death
on suspicion of aiding him.</i>

41
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,441
Simply meeting the magician
is easy enough.

42
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:58,154
<i>The magician's eyes are
sensing something amiss in this village.</i>

43
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,907
<i>It's only a matter of time
before he arrives himself.</i>

44
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:05,328
<i>This dungeon is like his arms and legs.</i>

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,373
<i>You're familiar
with his terrifying power, aren't you?</i>

46
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,584
But I still need to try.

47
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,088
I don't know if you can have
a conversation with him.

48
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:19,592
<i>But seek the aid of the Winged Lion
imprisoned in the depths of the dungeon.</i>

49
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,887
<i>You should be able
to subdue the magician's power.</i>

50
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,937
This passage will lead you
within the castle walls,

51
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,731
taking you back to the dungeon.

52
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,942
Please take this!

53
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,610
Thank you.

54
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:42,407
{\an8}Don't give them too much,
or it will burden the carriers.

55
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,616
{\an8}The carriers?

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,328
{\an8}I'll have them take you back
the same way they brought you here.

57
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,833
Thank you. We owe you.

58
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,710
Good luck.

59
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:04,804
I know I shouldn't say this,
but are they really the ones?

60
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,764
I'd like to think so.

61
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,228
Yaad.

62
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,896
T-Thistle!

63
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,775
Who were you talking to just now?

64
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,658
For the umpteenth time!

65
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,826
This place…

66
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,494
Ow…

67
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:31,456
{\an8}It's a reservoir
crafted by ancient dwarves.

68
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,709
{\an8}That insanely huge place, right?
Which section of it are we now?

69
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,462
My compass isn't working.

70
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,591
Dwarves do cunning stuff like that.

71
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,469
Apparently, it was also once
a defensive stronghold.

72
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,012
<i>Dwarves…</i>

73
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,849
Senshi, are you feeling
teleportation sickness?

74
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:53,352
Given dwarves' sensitive
semicircular canals, it's quite common.

75
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,688
Do gnomes suffer from it as well?

76
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,232
I think they get mana sickness too.

77
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,735
Where am I?

78
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,403
Are you back to yourself?

79
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,238
W-What…

80
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,409
Are you okay?

81
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,495
Rest there a little.

82
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:12,246
We'll go explore the area.

83
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,001
Chil.

84
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,504
Can you see these marks here?

85
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,883
Yeah, I see them.

86
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,053
I need you to draw the symbols
on the pillars surrounding us.

87
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,514
It will aid us in estimating
our approximate location.

88
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,599
How do you know about that?

89
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,935
These locations typically have them.

90
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,645
They're like a code.

91
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:41,734
Well, it means not all dwarves
have a strong sense of direction.

92
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:47,532
I've got it.

93
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,742
It seems we're in the southeast section--

94
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,161
Everyone, listen!

95
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,038
They're back.

96
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,666
We might have found Falin!

97
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,502
These are Falin's tracks?

98
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,296
She spotted us and ran away, though.

99
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,881
I'm sure it was her.

100
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,217
It was her silhouette, right?

101
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,304
I think it was a Griffin
or something similar.

102
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,933
A-A Griffin?

103
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,520
It's a monster with the upper body
of a bird and the lower body of a lion.

104
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,606
I've never heard of Griffins
being in this dungeon.

105
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,693
Do you recognize the scent?

106
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,653
I'm not a dog, you know.

107
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,450
It smells like a beast.

108
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,577
Anyway, we have to track her down quickly.

109
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,578
No.

110
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,580
Huh?

111
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,248
No? Why?

112
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,167
Well, um…

113
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,793
It might be Falin.

114
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,211
Well…

115
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,339
T-Those are mushrooms
I've never seen before.

116
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,841
I want to try cooking them.

117
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:47,967
Mushrooms?

118
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,970
I recall seeing them somewhere.

119
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,598
They're poisonous,
so don't think of eating them.

120
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,766
I don't like Griffins.

121
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,603
How can you dislike
a monster you've never met?

122
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,229
Whatever. Let's go!

123
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,273
-W-Wait! Don't!
-Huh?

124
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,774
It's risky to move about!

125
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,193
Watch out!

126
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,282
{\an8}I knew it.

127
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,742
It's a Griffin!

128
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,333
So cool! I've never seen one before!

129
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,792
A Griffin…

130
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,795
All that fuss for nothing!

131
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,089
It's coming back!

132
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,049
Get back!

133
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,052
<i>Sperae Yeptum Rufermus.</i>

134
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:37,391
<i>Rufermus Sperae Alamandras Tronsum.
Yovis Stantinus Histum…</i>

135
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,354
My aim!

136
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,689
Senshi! Don't run with your back to it!

137
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,199
-Senshi!
-Senshi!

138
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,084
This is bad.

139
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,004
It happened so quickly,
I couldn't do anything.

140
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,257
Did Senshi have any weapons with him?

141
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,800
No, he was unarmed.

142
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,176
We have to go after him now!

143
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,471
Will you climb up each pillar
to look for him?

144
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,056
Well, I won't.

145
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,808
<i>Which way did it go?</i>

146
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,352
<i>If it's taken him to a high place,
there's nothing we can do.</i>

147
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,062
<i>We won't even be able to find his body.</i>

148
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,022
<i>Just like that?</i>

149
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:26,482
<i>He was unarmed…</i>

150
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,984
<i>We might never see him again.</i>

151
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,695
Marcille, is there anything we can do?

152
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,076
We'll summon Familiars to search for him.

153
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,536
Familiars?

154
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,037
You're going to conjure monsters?

155
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,749
It's more accurate
to say "create" than "conjure."

156
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,585
There are three types of summoning.

157
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,797
<i>First, you can dominate
and control existing spirits or monsters.</i>

158
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,924
<i>But the conditions for this are complex,</i>

159
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,844
<i>and it might attract the attention
of the lord of the dungeon.</i>

160
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,514
<i>Second, you can alter
animals and plants into monsters.</i>

161
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,849
<i>But this isn't an option either,</i>

162
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,351
<i>as it takes an immense amount
of time and preparation.</i>

163
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,104
Third, you can create them from scratch.

164
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,522
This time, we'll use this method.

165
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,608
It sounds the most complicated.

166
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,652
It is if you're creating
an autonomous creature.

167
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,614
But for now,
we only need one that's mobile.

168
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,284
I'll prepare the magic circle,

169
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:20,703
so gather all the meat we have
and throw it into a pot.

170
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:21,746
Got it.

171
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,418
Is that all we have?

172
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,420
It'd be better if we had a bit more.

173
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,466
There's nothing else.

174
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:35,259
We do have cheese and eggs, though.

175
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:36,344
And vegetables!

176
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,514
I suppose they'll help boost
the calorie count.

177
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:41,515
Fetch them.

178
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:42,433
Right.

179
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,731
What kind of monster are you making?

180
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,483
Can you control it at will?

181
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,567
Show me how to do it.

182
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:52,485
Absolutely not!

183
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:56,072
Get certified to handle dangerous magic
through the proper channels first!

184
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,408
There's actually a process for that?

185
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,162
Hey, who's that old guy anyway?

186
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,164
How did he join your group?

187
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,125
And what's with his obsession with food?

188
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,087
Huh?

189
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,673
Are you saying you don't know,
after acting so friendly with him?

190
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,718
Well, we just never had the opportunity.

191
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,180
None of us are keen
on discussing our personal lives.

192
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,932
{\an8}But…

193
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,518
<i>I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious.</i>

194
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,437
<i>There's a lot to question
about Senshi's words and actions.</i>

195
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,649
Do you remember what he said
when we first met him?

196
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:36,320
He claimed to have been studying monster
food in this dungeon for over ten years.

197
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,740
<i>But this dungeon
was only discovered six years ago.</i>

198
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,200
<i>But…</i>

199
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:45,996
<i>He carries a couple of pots and knives
crafted from precious metals too.</i>

200
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,666
<i>And he managed
to decipher ancient dwarf code.</i>

201
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,794
<i>He's afraid of a monster
from a level we haven't explored yet.</i>

202
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,963
<i>And he persistently treats me
as if I'm a kid.</i>

203
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,465
The last statement is a bit too nitpicky.

204
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,425
Nope.

205
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,928
Folks who aren't familiar with our race
often make this mistake.

206
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,639
They don't get that half-foots
are their own race.

207
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,351
They think we'll turn into tall-men
or dwarves when we're grown.

208
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:08,644
But…

209
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,939
these misconceptions are only present
in certain places, like the East.

210
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:15,192
{\an8}If he's been on this island for a decade,
he should know better.

211
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,447
{\an8}Maybe he's not from the surface at all.

212
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,908
Once we manage to rescue Senshi,

213
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,578
we should reintroduce ourselves.

214
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,917
<i>Sperae Yeptum Rufermus.</i>

215
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:35,546
<i>Rufermus Sperae Vilal Indumreezbam.</i>

216
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,257
{\an8}<i>Martis Tilnunt Eesdum.</i>

217
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,344
{\an8}<i>Histum Eres Anjarkant Rementalent.</i>

218
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,187
Is it ready?

219
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:53,189
It should be.

220
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,816
Let's open the lid.

221
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,377
Thank goodness!

222
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,713
I was worried,
but it looks like it worked!

223
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,591
What's with the expression?
As long as they move, it's fine!

224
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:24,053
We can't waste limited resources
on unnecessary details!

225
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,346
Okay, fly!

226
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,517
What's wrong?

227
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,145
Their vision is overlapping with mine,
and it's making me sick.

228
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,648
Someone, cover my eyes.

229
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,361
The lunatic magician
controls many of these.

230
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:42,696
How does he manage all the information?

231
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,906
I'm so curious.

232
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,741
Save that for later.

233
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,034
Right now, focus on Senshi.

234
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,370
I'll look for any foreign objects

235
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:51,413
by following
the Dungeon Cleaners and spirits.

236
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,290
Follow me!

237
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,587
You can't follow, is that it?

238
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,173
I-It's not easy to walk while flying!

239
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,925
I'll carry her.

240
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,010
Izutsumi and Chil, take my stuff.

241
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,054
Here we go, Marcille.

242
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,640
What? I'm scared!

243
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,475
Put your arms around me.

244
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,269
No! I'm going to fall!

245
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,436
Stay still or you will fall!

246
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,441
What kind of position is that?

247
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,735
It seems like
this is the most comfortable for her.

248
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,121
The Dungeon Cleaners
are gathering around that pillar!

249
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,455
That's probably where…

250
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,293
Senshi!

251
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,669
I found him!

252
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,754
He's pinned high up on a pillar!

253
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,923
Griffins impale their prey, huh?

254
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,758
<i>We're here to rescue you, Senshi!</i>

255
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,260
<i>Can you tell who I am?</i>

256
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,177
A fly?

257
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,891
<i>He won't budge.</i>

258
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,309
<i>How can I get him down?</i>

259
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,185
Careful, Marcille.

260
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,313
Griffins have incredibly sharp eyes.

261
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,650
By the time we spot them,
they've already spotted you.

262
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,447
I can't see anything anymore.

263
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,783
A Griffin's body is highly functional.

264
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,619
Their wings are powerful.

265
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,496
Their supple bodies are agile,
with explosive power.

266
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,041
Their beaks and talons are sharp as well.

267
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,792
Outwitting one will be very challenging.

268
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,338
<i>Creatures are shaped
the way they are out of necessity.</i>

269
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,548
<i>They don't have unnecessary details.</i>

270
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,845
{\an8}Laios, what form would be effective
against a Griffin?

271
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,393
Do we really need that horn?

272
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,229
Streamlined bodies
experience less air resistance,

273
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:41,941
which should enhance agility.

274
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,070
<i>Remember the Wyverns
under the lunatic magician's control?</i>

275
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,988
<i>They were as swift as arrows.</i>

276
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,823
<i>Let's try to replicate their shape.</i>

277
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,787
This should do for now.

278
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,829
Try flying it.

279
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,752
It's flying completely differently!

280
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,045
We should have a chance now!

281
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,172
While Senshi climbs down,

282
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,257
I'll keep the Griffin distracted!

283
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,551
Everyone else, be prepared to fight
and provide backup!

284
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,054
Why's she doing that?

285
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,306
Maybe she needs to feel a sense of unity.

286
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,308
<i>Come on, Senshi.</i>

287
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,268
<i>Use this rope!</i>

288
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,562
<i>Good, and now…</i>

289
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,690
<i>It's fast!</i>

290
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,693
<i>I'll draw the Griffin away!</i>

291
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,277
<i>Come on, follow me!</i>

292
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,701
<i>Now, back to the ground!</i>

293
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,458
It got me.

294
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,502
It's not good enough…

295
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:45,587
I'm no match for it at all.

296
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,505
What should I do?

297
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,549
I've got it! Leave it to me!

298
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,759
I'll make it stronger and tougher!

299
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,346
I'll add horns, give it fangs
and sharp claws!

300
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,224
I'll cover it with scales
and even add another head!

301
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,560
With more potential,
it's sure to be strong!

302
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,145
And it'll breathe fire and ice too!

303
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:02,229
So cool!

304
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,523
<i>How do I take down a Griffin?</i>

305
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,651
<i>Do I need to focus on offense or defense?</i>

306
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,028
<i>No!</i>

307
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,909
-My Giga Double-headed Flame Ice Dragon!
-<i>We don't need claws or fangs.</i>

308
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,038
<i>It should be faster, more lithe,
and more beautiful.</i>

309
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:23,917
<i>What's needed here is determination
and ego to make a creature</i>

310
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,919
<i>with the single goal of rescuing Senshi!</i>

311
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,423
<i>At that moment, Marcille's intense passion</i>

312
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,799
<i>and her prayers</i>

313
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,761
<i>brought about a miracle.</i>

314
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,305
I'll give you a name.

315
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,932
With silver-white wings
that streak across the skies…

316
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,312
I summon the Sky Fish!

317
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,022
It's so…

318
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,065
lame.

319
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,357
No, this is fine!

320
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,651
Now, go!

321
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,827
-It's so fast!
-The way it moves is gross!

322
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,454
I'm going all out!

323
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,955
Everyone, get ready!

324
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,374
Seriously, what's her deal?

325
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,543
She's putting in her best effort,
that's what.

326
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,137
<i>I can't change course!</i>

327
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,934
<i>This time!</i>

328
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,895
<i>I'll turn around and…</i>

329
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,606
<i>Punch through!</i>

330
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:53,173
Are you okay?

331
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,675
Y-Yeah.

332
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,718
You should take a break for a bit.

333
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,013
We'll start cooking,
so just rest over there.

334
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:09,898
Thank you.

335
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,359
You did well.

336
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,611
<i>Sky Fish…</i>

337
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,367
This is amazing.

338
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,870
The vegetables
are packed inside like organs.

339
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,374
Did you still need it?

340
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:29,168
No, but…

341
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,088
I was expecting you
to mourn a bit, you know?

342
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,756
I wanted some time for that.

343
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,216
-Are you okay, Senshi?
-Marcille.

344
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,719
They've already fulfilled their lives.

345
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,263
Consuming their bodies
is a way to honor them.

346
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,473
But still…

347
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,978
Fine. Do as you want.

348
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,732
<i>Cut the Familiar into appropriate lengths.</i>

349
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,484
<i>Remove the wings at the base.</i>

350
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,279
<i>Dab away excess moisture with a cloth,</i>

351
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,740
<i>and season with salt and pepper.</i>

352
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,617
<i>Fold the wings up small.</i>

353
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:07,164
<i>Blend flour, egg, and water thoroughly,
then coat the slices in the mixture.</i>

354
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,373
<i>And deep fry them.</i>

355
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,211
<i>The wings will brown quickly
so a quick dip will do.</i>

356
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,338
<i>Serve with sauce and…</i>

357
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,131
It's done!

358
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,051
SKY FISH AND CHIPS

359
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,310
The meat and vegetables
have melded together and it's delicious!

360
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,686
Yeah, literally.

361
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,398
Summoning might actually be
a superior cooking technique!

362
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,527
If it consumes a week's worth of food
for just one meal, it's hardly superior.

363
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:41,198
Damn. I should've
taken their liquor along.

364
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,201
Izutsumi, eat the other parts too,
not just the wings.

365
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,118
I don't want to.

366
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,579
Senshi, have a bite too.

367
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,417
Is the Griffin bothering you?

368
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,585
Want to drain the blood?

369
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,004
N-No, never mind.

370
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,007
I'm not hungry right now.

371
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,595
Hey, Senshi.

372
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,766
My name's Chilchuck.

373
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:11,937
I'm from a small village
nestled in a basin, northeast of here.

374
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,690
For about a decade,

375
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,317
I've been doing business
around different dungeons.

376
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,071
From picking locks to interpreting,
mediating, and appraising.

377
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,533
{\an8}Also, I have a wife and daughters,

378
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,952
{\an8}but I haven't seen them in years
for various reasons.

379
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:27,869
What?

380
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,331
-That's pretty much my backstory.
-A wife and daughters?

381
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,376
Now, tell us about yourself.

382
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,087
Why are you living down here?

383
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,922
What happened?

384
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,681
My name is Senshi of Izganda.

385
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,601
I used to belong to a small mining crew.

386
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:57,316
<i>We were miners, but not for ore.</i>

387
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,901
<i>We sought relics from before the war,</i>

388
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,487
<i>dreaming of hitting the jackpot.</i>

389
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:06,491
<i>That said, the majority
of our discoveries were ore,</i>

390
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:11,872
<i>and finding relics like gears or lenses
was a rare stroke of luck.</i>

391
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,333
{\an8}<i>Then, one day,</i>

392
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:18,170
{\an8}<i>we unearthed something huge.</i>

393
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,342
<i>An ancient castle gleaming with gold.</i>

394
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,764
That's right. It was this very dungeon.

395
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,939
