1
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:32,926
No way.

3
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,178
Falin…

4
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,348
C-Could she really be resurrected
from that condition?

5
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,017
It's not unprecedented, but…

6
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,188
H-Hey, Laios.

7
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,981
We don't know that yet.

8
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,733
I'll take her to the resurrection office.

9
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,277
Are you planning to take the entire mass?

10
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,863
There are probably Warg bones
in there as well.

11
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,782
I can't distinguish them, so…

12
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,493
I'll help.

13
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,038
Wait!

14
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,167
{\an8}The bond between her soul and flesh
is very fragile right now.

15
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:07,752
{\an8}Moving her remains is risky.

16
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,006
<i>The greater the damage to one's flesh,
the more likely their soul is to depart.</i>

17
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,717
<i>The main reason some resurrections fail</i>

18
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,763
<i>is the soul's departure
or the incomplete restoration of the body.</i>

19
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,057
So, what do we do?

20
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,019
Bring a revivifier
and resurrect her right here.

21
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:29,983
<i>But it requires twice the calories
of the damaged parts to restore her.</i>

22
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,611
<i>They'll need to bring a substantial amount
of fresh blood and flesh along.</i>

23
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,739
{\an8}-They'll rot on their way here--
-No.

24
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,991
{\an8}What?

25
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:38,908
{\an8}Yes.

26
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,871
We have an abundance
of fresh blood and flesh right here.

27
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,373
W-Wait a minute!

28
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:47,166
Are you going to resurrect her?

29
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,293
Using dragon flesh?

30
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,920
But resurrection magic
isn't your specialty, is it?

31
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,300
I've been silent about it
because I didn't want to alarm you.

32
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:01,514
But I specialize in the study
of ancient magic that's forbidden now.

33
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,893
I think using that
is the only way we can bring her back.

34
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,395
{\an8}It's not honest magic, but still.

35
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,272
{\an8}-What?
-Black magic?

36
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,149
{\an8}Don't. No good will come of it.

37
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,693
{\an8}There is no good or evil in magic.

38
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,031
What do you say, Laios?

39
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:20,950
Do it, Marcille.

40
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,494
Bring Falin back to life.

41
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,748
Leave it to me.

42
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,957
I'll try my best.

43
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,584
Are you all out of your minds?

44
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,961
You're seriously going
to use dragon flesh?

45
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,631
Usually, they use goats or pigs.

46
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,549
It's kinda late
to start having qualms about it.

47
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,467
Marcille.

48
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,735
{\an8}Her body should be as close
to its original state as possible,

49
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,862
{\an8}so I'll start by reconstructing
her bone structure.

50
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,405
I see.

51
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,616
I have some knowledge
of a dog's skeletal framework.

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,494
I'll work on putting together
a Warg's frame.

53
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,374
{\an8}That's not necessary, is it?

54
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,335
{\an8}It could help avoid oversights or errors!

55
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,298
Humans typically have around 200 bones.

56
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,802
So, that means
there are roughly 840 bones here.

57
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,470
Huh? That many?

58
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,598
Based on the skulls, there were two Wargs.

59
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,351
A dog's body has around 320 bones.

60
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,396
It should be easier
if we begin with the simpler bones.

61
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,357
The more rounded one is a human rib cage.

62
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,568
Next, the vertebrae
that connect with the ribs.

63
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,655
This is easy as well since the curvature
of the spine is so distinct.

64
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,284
The tricky part
is the smaller bones of the arms and legs.

65
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,245
I can't distinguish them at all.

66
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,665
Let's start sorting them out,
beginning with the prominent ones.

67
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:54,043
The largest bone here is the ankle bone.

68
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,672
Arrange the other large bones
in a way that fits,

69
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,258
and we have the instep of a foot.

70
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,720
Lastly, the bones of the hand.

71
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,930
Let's start by arranging the fingers.

72
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,265
I got it!

73
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,184
Like this, right?

74
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,853
Close!

75
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,064
The longest metacarpal isn't
in the middle finger

76
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,441
but in the index finger.

77
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,278
Finally, we need to find the carpal bones
that connect the fingers to her arm.

78
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:26,909
Give me a hint!

79
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,703
You better not be enjoying this!

80
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,458
There.

81
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,001
It's done!

82
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,462
THE BONE STRUCTURES
OF FALIN AND WARGS

83
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,714
I don't know how to put it, but…

84
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:42,467
they're such beautiful
skeletal frameworks.

85
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:44,385
{\an8}They're really nice skeletons now.

86
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,679
{\an8}It seems they had good calcium.

87
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,974
{\an8}This won't revive
the Wargs as well, will it?

88
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,144
The only souls confined
to the dungeon are those of humans.

89
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:57,023
Otherwise, this place would be crowded
with the souls of all sorts of creatures.

90
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,328
Well then, I'll start.

91
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,748
<i>O Pilitsham.</i>

92
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,793
<i>O Esdoms. O Villaru.</i>

93
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,379
<i>Casuszameo Rotokt Artumcuks.</i>

94
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,257
<i>O Kunquikeo. Eoktum Kome.</i>

95
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:30,264
<i>Tumao Elm Finktow Kemesfo.
Aoewauk Aentujon.</i>

96
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,226
<i>Tumao Elm Finktow Kemesfo.</i>

97
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,853
<i>Aoewauk Aentujon.</i>

98
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,023
<i>Tumao Elm Finktow Kemesfo.</i>

99
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,277
<i>Aoewauk Aentujon…</i>

100
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,696
Marcille!

101
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,909
She's unconscious.

102
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,536
What happened?

103
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:53,162
Did it work?

104
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:12,974
Falin!

105
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,768
Her air passage is blocked with blood.

106
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,812
Try to stay calm and spit it out.

107
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,606
You're safe now.

108
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,279
Falin.

109
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,540
Laios…

110
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,129
Thank goodness.

111
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,133
Cold…

112
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,343
Right, my armor!

113
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,596
Sorry! I'll get you something to wear!

114
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,100
Falin, are you okay?

115
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:58,603
Are you unhurt?

116
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,689
That's good.

117
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,191
Marcille.

118
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:04,942
Marcille!

119
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,154
What happened to Falin?

120
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,072
She's come back to life.

121
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,201
She still seems a bit disoriented, though.

122
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,874
Falin!

123
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,046
Thank goodness!

124
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,173
I'm so relieved!

125
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,634
Marcille…

126
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,476
Chil…

127
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,977
How's she doing?

128
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,231
She still seems to be a little confused.

129
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:45,358
Right. Let me introduce him.

130
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,984
This is Senshi.

131
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,237
He helped us a lot on our journey.

132
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,948
Hello, Falin.

133
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,574
It's nice to meet you.

134
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,952
Sen…

135
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,878
Let's start preparing our meal!

136
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,677
Thank goodness!

137
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,013
I'm so relieved!

138
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,807
M-Marcille.

139
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,309
I can wash myself, you know.

140
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,563
I had to make sure your skin
was restored properly.

141
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,565
It tickles!

142
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,946
You have a bruise here!

143
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,156
T-That's from when I tripped

144
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,576
and bumped my chin
on the edge of the steps as a kid.

145
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,578
Oh.

146
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,665
Marcille, you look paler than me.

147
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,334
I'm just running low on magic.

148
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:48,546
I'll be fine if I have something to eat
and rest a little…

149
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,343
What are you doing?

150
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:58,598
I just wanted to share
some of my magic with you.

151
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,558
Oh, please.

152
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,603
{\an8}You don't have enough magic
right now to share.

153
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,604
But I do.

154
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,106
I'm feeling surprisingly great.

155
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,191
There's this power welling up inside me.

156
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,195
{\an8}But it's a bit like
recovering from an illness,

157
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,157
{\an8}so hold off on using magic
until you're back on your feet, okay?

158
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,537
{\an8}I died, didn't I?

159
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,417
{\an8}I can't remember how it happened.

160
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,586
{\an8}What exactly happened?

161
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,296
{\an8}Everyone is exhausted and scarred.

162
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,257
{\an8}And why is the Red Dragon here?

163
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,718
Are Namari and Shuro safe?

164
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,764
If everyone had to push themselves
because of me, then…

165
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,349
That's not…

166
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,018
{\an8}And what's up with that magic circle?

167
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,731
It didn't look like anything good.

168
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:55,071
If I forced you
to use something like that…

169
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,282
{\an8}It's fine!

170
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,913
Sure, getting here was challenging,
and I had some rough times.

171
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,540
But now, they're all just
stories to laugh about

172
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,793
because everything worked out!

173
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,797
So, don't worry about it.

174
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,133
None of us has any regrets at all.

175
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:26,310
{\an8}We can erase that magic circle altogether,
and it will be fine.

176
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,188
For now…

177
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:33,234
our main concern is the journey back.

178
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,611
What should we do about your clothes?

179
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:38,072
And I have to wash and dry mine.

180
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,950
Honestly, if it weren't for those frogs…

181
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,451
Frogs?

182
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,454
What's the plan now?

183
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,957
Head back to the surface.

184
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,710
We can't use return magic
or the Orcs' secret passage anymore.

185
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,130
We'll have to take the main road
back to the castle.

186
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,214
That's not what I meant.

187
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,969
{\an8}Even though you've rescued your sister,
you're still penniless.

188
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,888
{\an8}I do have some savings in the bank.

189
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,807
{\an8}But you don't have a token, right?

190
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,268
{\an8}And to get it reissued,
it'll take a month.

191
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,353
{\an8}That's the predicament.

192
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,690
{\an8}Anyway, Marcille, that girl!

193
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,191
{\an8}Did you know, Laios?

194
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,152
{\an8}That she could use black magic?

195
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,821
{\an8}She never shared many details,

196
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:22,241
{\an8}but she mentioned wanting
to explore the dungeon for her studies.

197
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,993
{\an8}I thought it was odd.

198
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,497
Why would an elf who doesn't seem
to be desperate venture into the dungeon?

199
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,000
She's not one of those dark elves, is she?

200
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,836
I hope this won't lead to any trouble.

201
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,882
Who are you calling a dark elf?

202
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,136
{\an8}I-I mean, if it was harmless,
it wouldn't be forbidden, right?

203
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,387
Harmless?

204
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,890
Even recovery magic
can be used for torture.

205
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,934
Just like a blade,
it depends on how you use it.

206
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,396
I study forbidden arts to benefit people.

207
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,149
I have nothing to feel guilty about.

208
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:59,069
{\an8}But concerning the method
of resurrection I used,

209
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,572
{\an8}it's best for all of us
to forget about it.

210
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,407
{\an8}So you do feel guilty about it!

211
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,410
Oh, well. Never mind.

212
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,120
It's all in the past now.

213
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,414
By the way…

214
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,922
<i>Where's Senshi?</i>

215
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,798
Preparing the dragon meat, I imagine.

216
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:24,845
I just passed Mr. Senshi
carrying a pot and some firewood.

217
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,013
What did I tell you?

218
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,306
He's getting ready to cook.

219
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,683
Cook…

220
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,435
Near the dragon?

221
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,189
-This is bad!
-This is bad!

222
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,649
What's wrong?

223
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,984
When we opened up the dragon,
we opened its fuel bag, too.

224
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,278
If he starts a fire there now…

225
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,323
Senshi!

226
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,699
Stop!

227
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,952
Senshi!

228
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:06,136
W-We're alive.

229
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
Is this defense magic?

230
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,396
Falin, did you do this?

231
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,147
It seems so.

232
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,232
In that split second?

233
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,400
Without chanting?

234
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,402
I don't know.

235
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,905
I just felt I had to protect everyone and…

236
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,408
That's amazing.

237
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,119
Kind of like an adrenaline rush, huh?

238
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,247
If only we had that power
during the fight with the Red Dragon.

239
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,167
A-Anyway, you've just been revived,

240
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,545
so hold off on using any more magic, okay?

241
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:41,922
That took me by surprise.

242
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:45,301
I told you dragons breathe fire
with their self-made fuel, right?

243
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,553
Your fire ignited that fuel.

244
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,763
It won't go out.

245
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,266
The fat in its body is burning.

246
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,559
It'll eventually go out.

247
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,229
Until then,
I won't be able to get its meat.

248
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,565
What a pickle.

249
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:04,653
Maybe I could use that for cooking.

250
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,825
Combine flour, yeast, salt,
and water, and knead well.

251
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,577
Let it rest for a while and…

252
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,078
In the meantime, go take a bath.

253
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,582
Stretch and shape the dough,

254
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,584
then add toppings to it.

255
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:22,087
Sprinkle flour on the dragon's skin,

256
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:25,090
then, put them inside the dragon.

257
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,843
Cut off the tip of the tail.

258
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,845
What a waste!

259
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,848
Peel the skin and use it to make a soup.

260
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:38,979
Cut the meat into blocks and sear
on the hot dragon scales until golden.

261
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,981
Then, marinate in sauce.

262
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,236
It's done!

263
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,529
DRAGON TAIL SOUP

264
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,491
ONION PIZZA, ROAST RED DRAGON

265
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,243
Looks so good!

266
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:55,829
Can we eat it?

267
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,206
-Of course, not!
-Of course, not!

268
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,258
It's delicious!

269
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,261
It feels like the first meal
I had in a long time.

270
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,179
Good!

271
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,223
It's your turn to eat your fill of it.

272
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,683
Oh, well.

273
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,726
She seems to be enjoying it, so.

274
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,571
It's really chewy,
but the taste is oddly familiar.

275
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,991
What is this taste?

276
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,034
It's not quite like beef or pork, though.

277
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,912
And this flavor reminds me…

278
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,748
a little of Living Armor, don't you think?

279
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:40,916
Does it?

280
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,794
It doesn't have that rusty smell, though.

281
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,131
And the Kelpie and frog meat
were more tender.

282
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,174
If anything, it's a bit like the Basilisk.

283
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,051
What do you think, Laios?

284
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,056
I don't know what you're all on about.

285
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,307
This vibrant red!

286
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,059
This firmness!

287
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,811
This rich taste!

288
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,564
Each characteristic is like no other!

289
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,443
Why compare the taste of dragon
with other creatures in the first place?

290
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:11,196
This is the taste of a dragon!

291
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,745
{\an8}Um, Falin.

292
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,456
{\an8}You might have
already figured this out, but…

293
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,959
We couldn't afford to buy food,
so we made it this far by eating monsters.

294
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,588
That's amazing.

295
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,965
That's amazing!

296
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,759
What monsters did you eat?

297
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,011
H-How did you prepare them?

298
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,554
Seems like we didn't have to worry.

299
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,306
This is exactly what I was afraid of!

300
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,683
First, we had a Huge Scorpion and a Slime.

301
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,061
We even tried a Walking Mushroom.

302
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,520
A Walking Mushroom?

303
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,607
We even harvested vegetables from Golems.

304
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,443
What about a Fish-man?

305
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:51,737
We didn't try that.

306
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,739
But we did eat Living Armor.

307
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,741
What?! What part did you eat?

308
00:17:55,824 --> 00:18:02,289
Um, it's actually a colony of mollusks
wearing a shell and…

309
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:05,167
Wouldn't it be simpler
to just show her the real thing?

310
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,589
What's this?

311
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,680
{\an8}Why didn't you tell us about it?!

312
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,973
{\an8}Sorry.

313
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,393
It's cute. Is it a pulmonata?

314
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,774
It went back inside.

315
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,113
It moves on its own.

316
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,739
Seriously?

317
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,657
My bad.

318
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,786
I planned to keep it temporarily
until I found another weapon at first.

319
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,413
But I kept it because
of its useful reactions to other monsters.

320
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,458
{\an8}So that's how you showed
really sharp instincts now and then!

321
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,627
{\an8}We should've gotten Namari to examine it.

322
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,798
In that situation, I agree
you had no choice but to use the sword.

323
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,550
But it shouldn't have been
a solo decision.

324
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,595
The greatest damage
is the loss of trust from your teammates.

325
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,347
It was careless of me.

326
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,849
It won't happen again.

327
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,809
So, what will you do with it?

328
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,311
Until I find another weapon,
I'd like to keep using it.

329
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:09,481
<i>I could dunk it in water
and drown the creature.</i>

330
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,358
<i>I'd have to disassemble
the sword to remove it,</i>

331
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,277
<i>so it'll probably rot inside, though.</i>

332
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,444
<i>That's kinda unpleasant.</i>

333
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,321
<i>I suppose we can wait and see for a while.</i>

334
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,783
You're the one
who said monsters are dangerous.

335
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,828
It's not like I forgot about that.

336
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,830
But I thought I had neutralized it

337
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:27,833
and that I could use it to my advantage.

338
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,960
But it didn't pan out.

339
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:32,588
{\an8}I guess it's impossible to use a monster
while keeping it alive.

340
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,507
What does it taste like?

341
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,092
Wanna try?

342
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,219
Oh, yeah!

343
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:50,022
There are a lot of doors,
but only two of them lead outside.

344
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,857
No need to worry
about surprise attacks, then.

345
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,114
This house seems quite comfortable.

346
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,366
The fact it has seven toilets
raises questions, though.

347
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,368
All right. Let's get some sleep here.

348
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,828
Hurray!

349
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,080
It's been so long
since I last slept on a bed!

350
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,666
We'll still have to use
our sleeping bags as blankets, though.

351
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,468
Sorry for intruding on your home
without asking.

352
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,970
We'll leave as soon as we rest a little.

353
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,889
What's the matter?

354
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,515
I think she's a resident.

355
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,892
She says she'll let us stay.

356
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,393
I see.

357
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,561
That's great.

358
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:34,650
We're short on sleeping bags,
so we'll have to share on the way back.

359
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,362
We haven't slept in the same bed
since our school days!

360
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,030
I wonder if we'll both fit.

361
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,784
I've gotten much bigger since then.

362
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,245
You cheeky little!

363
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:52,084
To me, you'll always be my little girl!

364
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,173
I'm really glad I got to see you again.

365
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,759
Me, too.

366
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,431
I'll go say goodnight
to my brother before bed.

367
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,353
Laios.

368
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,689
Falin.

369
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,823
This scar…

370
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,992
You did something reckless, didn't you?

371
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:25,951
Why did you…

372
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,625
Just to be clear, you're the one
who did something reckless first.

373
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,794
So it's on you
that things turned out like this!

374
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,712
What?

375
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,339
{\an8}Don't ever do something like that again!

376
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,592
I can't even recall what I did.

377
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,767
I won't do it again.

378
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,981
Goodnight, Laios.

379
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,984
Goodnight, Falin.

380
00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:00,939
