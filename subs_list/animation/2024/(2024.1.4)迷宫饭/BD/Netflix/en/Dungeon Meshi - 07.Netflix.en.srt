1
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,887
This one isn't dead. Just paralyzed.

3
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,306
On this floor, of all places?
Can you revive him?

4
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,641
Not sure.

5
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,779
Good. Looks like you're revived.

6
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:59,619
We were wiped out?

7
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,996
My necklace is gone.

8
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,374
My coins are gone, too.

9
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,501
And so are all the jewels.

10
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:09,546
We lost some of our belongings.

11
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,964
Do you know anything about it?

12
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,758
No doubt about it.
They were taken out by Treasure Bugs.

13
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:14,676
Shh!

14
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,636
Nah, we don't know a thing.

15
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,722
We found you all
lined up nicely on the ground.

16
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:23,476
Some folks must have
passed here before we did.

17
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,812
A strand of hair.

18
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,481
It's magic to ward off ghosts.

19
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,568
Someone definitely
came in contact with us.

20
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,738
An elf…

21
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:37,740
A tall-man…

22
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,244
{\an8}A half-foot… And a dwarf.

23
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,997
They had a meal here.

24
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,582
A meal?

25
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,375
They sure have some nerve.

26
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,376
Let's go after them.

27
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,961
Hold up.

28
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,505
We're not a charity, you know.

29
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,509
Here.

30
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,760
Thanks.

31
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,015
Why didn't you tell them?

32
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,474
It's simple.

33
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,852
The more corpses, the better.

34
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,776
I really want to wash my hair soon.

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,778
You'll feel refreshed
if you crop your hair.

36
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,573
There you go again, saying mean things.

37
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,576
Don't you want
to wash your beard as well, Senshi?

38
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,455
How long has it been
since you last washed it?

39
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,873
Let's give it a wash right now!

40
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,793
Your hair plays an important role
in magic, too.

41
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,547
Taking care of it is like warm-up.

42
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,468
With your beard like that,
my support magic might not work on you.

43
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,928
That would be just great.

44
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:43,306
Right! I have really nice soap.

45
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,476
I'll wash your beard with it and braid it!

46
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,814
Huh? I can't find it.

47
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,693
<i>Right, that day…</i>

48
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,905
No way! It was so expensive, though!

49
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,198
Let's go.

50
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,951
<i>On the fourth basement floor,</i>

51
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,120
<i>there is a lake formed
by underground water</i>

52
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:08,164
<i>flowing through carved-out bedrock.</i>

53
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,710
<i>The magic-infused water
emits a faint glow,</i>

54
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,296
<i>and far in the depths of the water,</i>

55
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,715
<i>the castle town can be seen
like a wavering illusion.</i>

56
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,970
How do you usually explore
the fourth floor, Senshi?

57
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,640
I fish and set traps around here.

58
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,141
That's about it.

59
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,978
How do you fellows get through this place?

60
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:32,855
With magic, of course.

61
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,441
I use this to do this and…

62
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:37,735
There!

63
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,906
We walk across on water.

64
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,075
N…

65
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:44,993
N…?

66
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,995
No!

67
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,122
No!

68
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,748
-No!
-No need to get so upset.

69
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,959
-No!
-This won't work.

70
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,877
{\an8}Let's tie a rope around him
and drag him along.

71
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,004
{\an8}No.

72
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,715
Put a spell on him
while I'm holding him down.

73
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,466
-What?
-With his armor--

74
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,262
With his armor, it's the only way
to get him across the water.

75
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,264
It's too dangerous to take a boat.

76
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,143
People easily fall for the path of ease.

77
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,730
It takes only a moment to get rusty,
but it takes a long, long time to--

78
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,647
There!

79
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,026
See? It wasn't such a big deal, was it?

80
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,402
Y-You…!

81
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:23,531
I don't get it.
Why do you hate magic so much?

82
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,201
You people are too casual
when it comes to using magic.

83
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,162
That's something I don't understand.

84
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,747
Now, now.

85
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,290
What's done is done.

86
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,917
You might actually like it.

87
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,547
-Huh?
-Huh?

88
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,215
W-Why?

89
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,301
Why isn't my magic working
as well as it should?

90
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:44,802
This must be it.

91
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,679
Ugh, is this an insulator?

92
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,724
It's soaked with the oils
and blood of various monsters.

93
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:50,850
Ew!

94
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,310
Wash it off quickly!

95
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,353
I'm not sure
if it will come off with just water…

96
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,730
No need.

97
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,692
I will get across the water in my own way.

98
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,943
Huh?

99
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,320
Are you gonna build a boat?

100
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,946
You'll sink like a stone in no time.

101
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,492
No, he must have some amazing plan.

102
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,660
You sure have a lot of confidence in him.

103
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,953
I don't get it.

104
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,455
Watch me.

105
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,085
-Is that the outer shell of a Mimic?
-Shh!

106
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,974
A Kelpie!

107
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,684
Watch out! Get back!

108
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,686
It's fine. It's harmless.

109
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:40,316
Anne is a horse
that always shows up whenever I fish.

110
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,234
Anne?

111
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:45,738
For a while now, I've been wondering
if I could use her to get across the lake.

112
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,115
-What?
-What?

113
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:51,244
Perhaps I can use the Mimic's shell
to steer her somehow.

114
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,122
T-That's…

115
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,706
so cool!

116
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,749
{\an8}THIS SCREAMS ADVENTURE

117
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,251
I'm against it.

118
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:02,880
I think it'd be more practical
to use its guts to make a float.

119
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,049
H-How can you say that?

120
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,009
How cruel of you!

121
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,137
Monsters are dangerous.

122
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,389
Especially ones that are charming.

123
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,017
Kelpies make you lower your guard
and entice you into the water.

124
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:18,396
You can never know
what's going on in a monster's mind.

125
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,233
I've known Anne for a long time,
just like I've known the golems.

126
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,902
I know her much better than you.

127
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,323
Why does everyone
have a soft spot for mammals

128
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,326
when they won't let me grow
a Man-eating Plant?

129
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,246
Do you really not know why?

130
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,915
Let's go, Anne!

131
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,422
-Senshi!
-Senshi!

132
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,590
-Marcille!
-Huh?

133
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,558
<i>Anne…</i>

134
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,316
<i>Stop it, Anne!</i>

135
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,489
Laios!

136
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,203
Forgive me, Anne.

137
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,962
No way.

138
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,006
No way!

139
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,467
Please no!

140
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,478
So, she was waiting for me
to get on her back?

141
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,689
But she could've attacked me
whenever she wanted.

142
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,649
I don't know.

143
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,944
There's no knowing
what a monster is thinking.

144
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,655
I don't understand.

145
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,448
I don't understand at all.

146
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,247
You must be cold.

147
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,374
I'll start a fire right now.

148
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,834
Hey!

149
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,004
You were that fond of her,
and now you're going to eat her?

150
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,215
Unbelievable.

151
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,258
Why, though?

152
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,301
Can I help?

153
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,512
No.

154
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,847
I'll do it on my own.

155
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:24,522
Hey.

156
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,276
Can I get some of the fat?

157
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:31,112
What brought this on?

158
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,448
Just an idea.

159
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,456
What on earth are we doing here?

160
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:43,874
Chilchuck.

161
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,836
Something is floating over there.

162
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,379
It better not be people.

163
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,505
Let's go and take a look.

164
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,632
What? I'd rather not.

165
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,888
What are these white things?

166
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,973
It's grain.

167
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,808
Looks like it's been spilled.

168
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,852
And here are the owners.

169
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:05,771
Let's draw them out of the water.

170
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,565
What is it?

171
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,568
Doesn't his face seem familiar?

172
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,569
Nope.

173
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,447
Oh, I know this kobold!

174
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,616
We found him dead
on the third basement floor.

175
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,784
How did they get ahead of us?

176
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,210
So, they met a Mermaid
and killed each other.

177
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,796
{\an8}The poor… things…

178
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,926
Chilchuck?

179
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,721
Chil! Chilchuck!

180
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,558
Chil!

181
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,468
They never let me finish the song,

182
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,553
even though
I took the trouble of remembering it.

183
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,266
That should do it.

184
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:28,062
We shouldn't let
the scattered grain go to waste.

185
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,438
Let's gather the grain for them.

186
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,023
That's going too far.

187
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,067
Then let's take them for ourselves.

188
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,819
It'll make Marcille happy.

189
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,654
<i>Poor Marcille.</i>

190
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:42,952
No!

191
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,870
I didn't say anything yet.

192
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,832
You promised not to go for demi-humans!

193
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,835
{\an8}Demi-humans…

194
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,962
What are they?

195
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,088
What do you mean?

196
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,090
<i>Mermaids come in different forms.</i>

197
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,092
<i>Some are mammals,
while others are more like fish.</i>

198
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,136
This one's in the fish category.

199
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,555
It lays eggs, so it doesn't have
a belly button or nipples.

200
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,597
Instead, it has gills.

201
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,560
They're farther removed
from humans than cows or pigs.

202
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,520
What?

203
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,982
-No way!
-What?!

204
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,859
Why, though?

205
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,486
Why can we eat cow but not a Fish-man?

206
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,488
It just doesn't feel right.

207
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,490
{\an8}Feel?

208
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,826
Feel, huh?

209
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,706
They're still at it.

210
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,667
I'm starting to feel hungry,
so how about we whip something up?

211
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,254
<i>Throw the grains in water
and put it over a fire.</i>

212
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,132
<i>Toss in some flaked Mimic
and waterweeds, then--</i>

213
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,508
Wait a minute.

214
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,886
That's the stuff that was growing
on the Fish-man's head.

215
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,389
Yeah, but this is just a normal plant.

216
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,641
The Fish-men use it to camouflage.

217
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,187
Without it, they'd look even more fishy.

218
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,482
Does it still upset your feelings?

219
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,525
<i>This is starting to become a bother.</i>

220
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,278
Fine. Have it your way.

221
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,034
<i>I think I might've made
an error in judgment just now.</i>

222
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,619
All right. It's ready.

223
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,038
PORRIDGE WITH SCATTERED BARLEY

224
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,874
Marcille, Senshi, let's have lunch.

225
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,126
Is it that time already?

226
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,545
Where did you manage to find some grains?

227
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,256
I scavenged them
from the fallen adventurers over there.

228
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,799
What on earth were you thinking?

229
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,553
<i>Good question.
I knew Marcille wouldn't disappoint.</i>

230
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,139
But you already cooked them, so.

231
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,141
I'll dig right in!

232
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,109
Hmm, there's a pop in the texture.

233
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,486
What is it?

234
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,779
Probably fish eggs.

235
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,864
They must've been on the water weeds.

236
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,116
It tastes good.

237
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,077
I know, right?

238
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,662
I'm glad I added them.

239
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,330
Come with me.

240
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,831
Hey!

241
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,125
Those were a Fish-man's eggs,
weren't they?

242
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,753
I've heard Fish-men have
a habit of laying their eggs on waterweeds

243
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,339
that they wear on their heads
to protect them or something!

244
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,049
What's the matter?

245
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,801
Marcille.

246
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,721
Does it taste good?

247
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,767
Yeah!

248
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:17,982
Senshi.

249
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,734
This is for you.

250
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,488
I made soap using the Kelpie's fat.

251
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:28,158
Kelpie's fat is often used as hair oil,

252
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,244
but it can also be used
for clothes and dishes.

253
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,541
Can I use it right now?

254
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,252
It's still being saponified,
so I'm not sure.

255
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,129
I want to give it a try.

256
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,006
You put a lot of effort
into making it, right?

257
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,842
Okay.

258
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,300
Thank goodness!

259
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,427
Now, we can move ahead together.

260
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,971
I see.

261
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,766
Now that it's come to this,
I've realized something.

262
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,687
Walking on water
actually feels quite nice.

263
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,815
Thank you, Marcille.

264
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,196
Some soap got into my eye.

265
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,250
Leave this to me.

266
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,711
I'll wipe them out!

267
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,963
Don't!

268
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,136
-Watch out!
-Ow!

269
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,140
I told you not to!

270
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,726
An underwater explosion
kills too many of them!

271
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,644
What?

272
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,564
These Blade Fish can be stewed,
grilled, steamed,

273
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,234
dried, smoked, or eaten raw.

274
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,653
They're delicious
no matter how you prepare them.

275
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,698
But they're a food source
for other monsters as well.

276
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,910
If their population decreases,
it could disrupt the dungeon's ecosystem.

277
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,579
So you should get them one at a time.

278
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,040
What? You're asking too much!

279
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:41,625
Now that I think about it,

280
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,294
it seems like there are fewer
mid-sized monsters around than usual.

281
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,295
See?

282
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,007
I can't just go easy on them, though.

283
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,925
Not when they're trying to kill us.

284
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,429
If anything,
there are more Blade Fish than usual.

285
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,556
I don't think there's anything
to be concerned about.

286
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,683
But what if the monsters end up starving?

287
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,811
I don't want to die
just to protect their ecosystem!

288
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,360
You people are too quick
to take the easy path.

289
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:12,573
What? Then you should try
taking them out one by one.

290
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,741
It's hard, you know!

291
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,287
You should think about the ecosystem more…

292
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,583
What's going on?

293
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:23,751
Senshi!

294
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,672
What was that all about?
They just passed by us.

295
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:30,591
Are you hurt?

296
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,302
Senshi?

297
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,680
Something is approaching.

298
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,765
What?

299
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,191
You're kidding, right?

300
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,443
It's way too huge!

301
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,579
A squid?

302
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,289
Or is it an octopus?

303
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,582
It's a Kraken!

304
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,293
It's a big monster to begin with,

305
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,545
but this one's a few times larger
than the usual ones!

306
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,964
It's so cool!

307
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,508
What do we do?

308
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,384
If we act rashly, it's gonna get us!

309
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,886
We'll draw its attention!

310
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,596
I'm counting on you, Marcille.

311
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,099
Magic again?

312
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,976
Relax. I'll strike it this time.

313
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,606
Here it comes!

314
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,775
Don't stop running!

315
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,325
Right there!

316
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,287
I did it!

317
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,173
No way! It didn't take a hit!

318
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,886
Using a weapon on it will only
slice through its outer skin at most.

319
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,490
There must be magic I can use…

320
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,867
Marcille!

321
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,619
-Use your magic again.
-What?

322
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,205
I can't pull off such a powerful magic
in quick succession.

323
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,123
No.

324
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,708
This will do.

325
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,628
I mean, this is your first encounter
with a Kraken, right?

326
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,798
Do you even know
what kind of monster it is?

327
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,258
-I don't.
-What?

328
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,427
I don't know much about Krakens,

329
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,013
but I have cleaned
squids and octopuses before.

330
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,891
Watch out, Marcille!

331
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,142
It's heading your way!

332
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,522
Water-Walk!

333
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,414
To kill a squid or an octopus,

334
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,666
stab it right between the eyes!

335
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,679
Amazing.

336
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,431
Huh?

337
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,724
Where's Laios?

338
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,187
Hey. I'm over here.

339
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:36,318
Looks like this creature was devouring
all the medium-sized monsters.

340
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,529
Both of you, come here.

341
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,327
You should try cleaning a cephalopod
at least once.

342
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:49,706
Stab squids and octopuses here
to kill them neatly.

343
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,959
Do squids and octopuses taste good?

344
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,419
No way! You've never tried them?

345
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,463
They taste really good, you know!

346
00:20:56,546 --> 00:21:01,093
You can stew, grill, steam, dry, smoke,
or even enjoy them raw.

347
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,971
{\an8}They really taste great
no matter how you cook them!

348
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,724
I know a good place,
so I'll show you there next time.

349
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,142
Can't I try one now?

350
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,979
I dug my own grave!

351
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,982
Wow, this is so weird!

352
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,984
How do I eat this?

353
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,236
Let's try salting it.

354
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,366
-It stinks.
-Well, well!

355
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,410
It tastes awfully bitter.

356
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,620
It's making my mouth tingle.

357
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,498
Marcille, do you really
eat this in various dishes?

358
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,501
No, I don't!
That's a weird misunderstanding!

359
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,638
How marvelous!

360
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,558
A big parasite for a big monster!

361
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,768
Ew, disgusting!

362
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,936
Throw it away now!

363
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,771
What's all the fuss about?

364
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,190
Most creatures
have parasitic worms inside them.

365
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,652
And many of them end up in our meals, too.

366
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,321
You didn't have to tell me that!

367
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,198
Well, if we cook it,
we should be able to eat this as well.

368
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,366
No!

369
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,660
That's one way of looking at it.

370
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,454
I said no!

371
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:31,016
Let's try broiling these with some sauce.

372
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,523
It's upsetting how amazing it smells!

373
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,241
It's done!

374
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,911
BROILED AND GLAZED
GIANT PARASITIC WORM

375
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,001
It's good!

376
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:02,005
I can't quite put it into words,
but it's really soft and delicious!

377
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,841
It's got a bit of a slime,
but it's quite meaty.

378
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,180
I-It's good.

379
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,348
Not bad.

380
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,143
This has a delicious taste
that's unlike your typical fish.

381
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,479
Isn't it even better
than squid or octopus?

382
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,481
That's not…

383
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,734
true, probably.

384
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:26,279
I'm pretty sure this would be delicious,
no matter how you prepare it as well.

385
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,657
I had a bite of it raw,
but it went down nicely.

386
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,492
Hold on, you ate it raw?

387
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,119
Just a little.

388
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,954
It was already dead, so it should be fine.

389
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,749
The fish are eating the Kraken.

390
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:42,254
That should help the medium-sized monsters
slowly come back.

391
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,259
My stomach…

392
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,262
Ow…

393
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,639
What's the matter? Are you okay?

394
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,849
Well, well…

395
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,226
It's just as I thought.

396
00:23:56,309 --> 00:24:00,772
Laios, what you have is the parasite
that was inside the giant parasitic worm.

397
00:24:02,357 --> 00:24:05,110
<i>It's the same kind
you find in your average fish, too.</i>

398
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,987
<i>I spotted one
when I was cleaning the big worm.</i>

399
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,029
<i>It can't be…</i>

400
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,157
It won't parasite on a human,

401
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,034
but it does make a hole in your stomach,
which can be very painful.

402
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,871
All you can do is wait for it to die.

403
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,541
I think I might die first.

404
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,085
Why not throw a healing spell
on him every now and then?

405
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,295
Good idea.

406
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,422
But I see now.

407
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,175
<i>The Fish-men eat the Blade Fish,</i>

408
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,510
<i>and the Kraken eats the Fish-men.</i>

409
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,888
<i>We took down the Kraken,</i>

410
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,931
<i>and the little fish feast on its flesh.</i>

411
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,852
<i>Laios ate the parasitic worm
inside the Kraken,</i>

412
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:42,189
<i>and the parasite within that worm
ended up poking a hole in Laios' stomach.</i>

413
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:48,361
I guess it was a little arrogant of me
to try to protect the ecosystem.

414
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:53,450
Right from the start, we were already
a part of the dungeon's circle of life.

415
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,454
<i>Laios attempted to speak,</i>

416
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:02,459
<i>but the excruciating pain and nausea
left his mind completely empty.</i>

417
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:07,297
<i>The agony, which felt as if knives
were slicing through his insides,</i>

418
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,548
<i>persisted all night.</i>

419
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:14,137
<i>And he vowed
never to eat a parasitic worm raw again.</i>

420
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,021
