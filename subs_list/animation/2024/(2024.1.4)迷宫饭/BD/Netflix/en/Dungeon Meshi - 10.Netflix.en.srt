1
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,836
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,851
Hey, are you sure we're on the right path?

3
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,895
Yup, these are the stairs we need to take.

4
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,523
After these steps,
we'll reach the fifth basement floor,

5
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,608
close to the orc settlement.

6
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,235
At least that's what it says on the map.

7
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,572
How are we supposed
to go down these steps?

8
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,908
This is incredible.

9
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,494
There's a wide variety
of Tentacles growing here.

10
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,247
The orcs totally made a fool of us.

11
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,332
They kindly laid a trap for us.

12
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:05,500
I'm not so sure.

13
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,502
This route leads to their settlement.

14
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,256
It's ideal for keeping away
outsiders at least.

15
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,883
Let's try moving forward.

16
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,763
Given the time and effort that would take,
taking a detour might be a quicker option.

17
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,394
Marcille, don't get
too close to the walls.

18
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,148
These creatures lurk within the walls.

19
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,277
<i>Places teeming with Tentacles
have just as many cavities.</i>

20
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,904
<i>It also means
there are many traps and devices.</i>

21
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,115
<i>The Tentacles crush
and break these devices</i>

22
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,994
<i>and they even grow on treasure chests,
working mischief together with the traps.</i>

23
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,163
<i>They're monsters
I want to see exterminated next to Mimics!</i>

24
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:46,332
There.

25
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,877
I think we made some pretty good progress…

26
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,549
Strange.

27
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:57,468
The orcs must've used this path
to climb to the third floor.

28
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,929
How did they manage to navigate this area?

29
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,473
Something's here.

30
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,725
Be careful.

31
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,026
Kensuke!

32
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,777
It's a Giant Frog!

33
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,654
Ugh, so gross!

34
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,907
No way!

35
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,783
I got this! <i>Aslam!</i>

36
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,790
No!

37
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,127
Ambrosia!

38
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,011
Senshi, behind you!

39
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,516
Don't let go!

40
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,893
Hang in there, Senshi!

41
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,478
M-Magic…

42
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,897
-It should be close enough.
-No! It's too close!

43
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,774
<i>This is bad.</i>

44
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,150
<i>What do we do?</i>

45
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,278
<i>Is that a trap?</i>

46
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:01,157
<i>There's a Tentacles growing unnaturally
from the wall next to the frog.</i>

47
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,285
<i>It's probably growing out
of the exit of a trap.</i>

48
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:07,538
<i>If I can extract it,
I could trigger the trap.</i>

49
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,290
<i>But…</i>

50
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,251
<i>how do I pull it out?</i>

51
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,753
<i>If I touch it directly,
my hands will get swollen.</i>

52
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,174
Laios!

53
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,928
Why are Giant Frogs safe
even when in contact with the Tentacles?

54
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,681
Huh?

55
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,598
No idea.

56
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,433
Maybe it's their biological makeup.

57
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,436
<i>So, you don't have any info on this?</i>

58
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,439
Children can be inquisitive
regardless of the situation, huh?

59
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,024
Fine!

60
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,871
Chilchuck!

61
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,502
<i>It doesn't hurt!</i>

62
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,628
<i>I can do this!</i>

63
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,338
Huh?

64
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,549
<i>I can't pull it out!</i>

65
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,101
-Chilchuck!
-Chilchuck!

66
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,363
Chilchuck!

67
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,203
He's alive.

68
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,204
Show me your hands!

69
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,457
Huh? They're unhurt.

70
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,833
I see.

71
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,419
He wrapped his hands
with the skin of a Giant Frog.

72
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,337
Well done!

73
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,842
Chilchuck,

74
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,304
this is a really great idea!

75
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,849
<i>Dissect a Giant Frog</i>

76
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:52,602
<i>and remove the skin from its body.</i>

77
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,228
U-Um, hey…

78
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,522
Peel the Tentacles

79
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,485
and save the narrow sections for later.

80
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,487
Boil the thicker portions,

81
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,490
then, after boiling, mash them
and knead with flour.

82
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,993
Shape the mixture into sticks,
and slice them into bite-sized pieces,

83
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,953
and boil once more.

84
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:11,913
Hey…

85
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,499
Lightly dry the Giant Frog skins,

86
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,502
<i>take various measurements, and sew.</i>

87
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,130
Heat olive oil, garlic,
and hot pepper in a pan,

88
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,009
then add the thigh meat of a Giant Frog
and sauté them together.

89
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,469
-It's done!
-It's done!

90
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,013
{\an8}TENTACLES GNOCCHI,
TENTACLES PASTA, FROG SUIT

91
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,390
<i>Ugh, just great!</i>

92
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,184
Bring them to me one person at a time!

93
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,270
You guys finished your tasks
while I was debating which of you to stop!

94
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,564
Come on, now, just give it a try.

95
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,567
Yes, give it a bite at least.

96
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,778
I said one person at a time!

97
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,906
And who knows
whether they're really safe or not?

98
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,618
WHISPER

99
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:54,372
{\an8}I think you'll look
really cute in it, Marcille.

100
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,846
You look so cute!

101
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,514
The color really suits you.

102
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,767
I like how your ears are contributing
to that frog-like silhouette.

103
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,310
Let's get moving.

104
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,437
Right.

105
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,402
Wow! It doesn't hurt at all!

106
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,779
Ugh, this is so disgusting!

107
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,781
How beautiful.

108
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,033
It's delicious.

109
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,582
Kensuke!

110
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,791
Thank goodness!

111
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,295
Look!

112
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,214
It's the castle town.

113
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,383
We're already on the fifth floor!

114
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,390
There are signs
of people fleeing in panic.

115
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,393
It seems the orcs were speaking the truth.

116
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,897
It's certain that there's
a Red Dragon around here.

117
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,983
Let's stay vigilant
and ready for combat as we move ahead.

118
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,278
Huh?

119
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,990
It seems like the Giant Frog's blood

120
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:14,535
has congealed inside
and got stuck to my clothes.

121
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,039
{\an8}We didn't have enough time
to dry the skins, after all.

122
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,917
Are we going
to fight the dragon like this?

123
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,423
How am I supposed
to reunite with Falin now, huh?!

124
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,050
Answer me!

125
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,817
-It feels like my insides are spinning.
-Kiki, Kaka.

126
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,987
Show Namari to the guest room
so she can rest.

127
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,825
{\an8}I will go to report
to the Lord of the Island.

128
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,835
<i>So, how was it inside the dungeon?</i>

129
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,505
The most concerning thing

130
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,840
is that it has become a rough place.

131
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,051
{\an8}All the treasures down
to the third basement floor

132
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,553
{\an8}have been plundered.

133
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,347
{\an8}And there are now
more hangouts for outlaws.

134
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,765
<i>What's worse,</i>

135
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:23,104
<i>orc hordes have started appearing
on the upper floors and causing trouble.</i>

136
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,732
You should consider deploying a troop
or offering rewards to deal with them.

137
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,112
I wonder where the orcs entered from.

138
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,157
I suspect that some old dwarf mines
might be connected to the dungeon.

139
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:38,119
Orcs tend to inhabit such passages.

140
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,870
Dwarves, huh?

141
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,998
How abominable.

142
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,749
<i>They're like moles.</i>

143
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,003
<i>No matter how you seal off their passages,
they keep making more.</i>

144
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,504
<i>A long time ago,</i>

145
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,425
<i>the elves and dwarves divided
into the east and west in conflict.</i>

146
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:57,346
<i>They say the dwarves hid in these lands
and waited for the arrival of the elves.</i>

147
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,890
Even after the war,
they continued to dig tunnels,

148
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:03,769
eventually swallowing the Golden City
and turning it into a dungeon.

149
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,315
I hear that the surviving dwarves
are responsible

150
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,109
for the dungeon's ongoing expansion.

151
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,154
That rumor cannot be trusted.

152
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,657
Anyhow, here is the magic circle I copied.

153
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,160
It's in Elvish, like all the others.

154
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,580
And based on the handwriting,
the author is likely the same individual.

155
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:26,667
There are absolutely no traces
of anyone tampering with it.

156
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,628
{\an8}The lord of the dungeon,

157
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:33,174
{\an8}the lunatic magician,
is most certainly the one who made this.

158
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,593
Is he an elf?

159
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,595
I can't be certain,

160
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,723
but this magic is beyond
the capabilities of a tall-man or a dwarf.

161
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,433
What a tricky situation.

162
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:47,813
The thing is, I received a letter
from the western elves the other day.

163
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:52,818
<i>It said, "The dungeon is our heritage.
Return it to us."</i>

164
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,112
{\an8}What a selfish demand!

165
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,365
{\an8}They're the ones who took this land
from the dwarves

166
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,284
{\an8}and handed it over to humans because
they didn't know what to do with it!

167
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,370
Ignore them.

168
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,706
This land was granted
by the king of the elves himself.

169
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,041
I can't just do that.

170
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,545
{\an8}They'll take this island, too.

171
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:13,339
That won't do.

172
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:17,802
There must be great treasure
still hidden in that dungeon.

173
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:19,053
Lord of the Island,

174
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,931
the elves aren't after the treasure.

175
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,184
<i>They're after the spell of immortality
that is cast on the dungeon.</i>

176
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,480
{\an8}The magic that ties the soul to the body
is still a big mystery.

177
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:34,693
{\an8}When that mystery is solved,
its worth will far surpass that of gold.

178
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,863
We must figure it out before the elves do.

179
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,158
Are you suggesting we copy
every single magic circle to study them?

180
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,701
Listen carefully!

181
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,664
When such great magic is involved,
there is always a blueprint.

182
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,207
Get your hands on it!

183
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,459
As long as you have it,

184
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,838
you can give up the dungeon
or anything you please.

185
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,133
Once the elves know you possess it,

186
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,635
they will finally treat you as an equal,

187
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:04,014
{\an8}no, they will kneel before you
to negotiate with you.

188
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,975
I-Is that so?

189
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,769
So? Where can I find this blueprint?

190
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,271
That's simple.

191
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:13,774
It's likely in the possession
of the lord of the dungeon.

192
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:17,194
In other words, you want me
to keep backing the explorers?

193
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,487
Precisely.

194
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,574
Don't bargain down the prices
for hunting monsters

195
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,033
and the loot from the dungeons.

196
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:26,495
Don't hoard your wealth
and provide even more support.

197
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,164
Very well.

198
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,791
I'll offer rewards for taking down orcs.

199
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,501
What do I say to the elves?

200
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,045
I'll help you buy time.

201
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,884
<i>Laios, was it?</i>

202
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,470
<i>He was a skilled adventurer,</i>

203
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,848
<i>but I wonder how far
his party can advance.</i>

204
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,898
Good morning, Namari.

205
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,483
How are you feeling?

206
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,486
My axe!

207
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,821
Your stuff is right here.

208
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,906
And

209
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,909
here's money from Grandpa Tansu.

210
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,995
It's more than I expected.

211
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,788
There might be a little break,

212
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,874
but he said he wanted
to request your help again.

213
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,918
T-Thanks.

214
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,127
I owe you.

215
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,796
I'll walk you to the street.

216
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,426
Do you have a home?

217
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,802
Or do you stay at an inn?

218
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,764
Neither. I'm heading toward the dungeon.

219
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,557
Why?

220
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,059
You're going under again?

221
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,268
No.

222
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,562
I have an errand to the nearby temple.

223
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,648
An errand?

224
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,649
An errand?

225
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,076
It's the resurrection office.

226
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,578
Namari!

227
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,165
Is it true you left Laios' party?

228
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,919
So, what are you looking for?
An item or a person?

229
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,003
A person.

230
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,881
{\an8}A female tall-man with light brown hair.

231
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,967
{\an8}It's around shoulder length.

232
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,260
{\an8}She's somewhere between…

233
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:07,680
her teens and her forties.

234
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,266
Wait. Do you mean Laios' sister?

235
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,310
She's in her twenties at most.

236
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,020
You should get your eyes checked.

237
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,524
It's hard to guess the age
of people from other races, okay?

238
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,653
We have no corpse here
that fits that description.

239
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,572
I see.

240
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,783
<i>On the fifth basement floor,</i>

241
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:32,162
<i>outside the Golden Castle,
lies the castle town.</i>

242
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:36,166
<i>The streets, expanded and warped by magic,</i>

243
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,171
<i>show traces of a time
when they bustled with activity.</i>

244
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,675
<i>Figures pass by the edge of your vision.</i>

245
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,177
<i>You hear whispers.</i>

246
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,514
<i>Such peculiar sensations wash over you.</i>

247
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,686
Seems like this was the location
for the orc settlement.

248
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,272
They must have left in quite a rush.

249
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,691
The pantry doors are left wide open.

250
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,568
What an awful stench.

251
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,195
Looks like the monsters in this area
scavenged this place.

252
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,157
It seems the flour and alcohol
are safe, though.

253
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,035
Let's make bread.

254
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,203
The orcs won't be happy
when they come back.

255
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:16,707
We gave them vegetables,
so it's a fair exchange.

256
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,888
Wargs.

257
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,933
It wasn't a fire, was it?

258
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,100
No.

259
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,519
They were defeated
by the Red Dragon's fire breath.

260
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,650
{\an8}The dragon passed through here
not too long ago.

261
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,401
H-Hey.

262
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,445
You mentioned before

263
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,907
that dragons sleep most of the time
and rarely move about.

264
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,911
But based on what the orcs told us
and the current situation,

265
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,913
it's still on the move.

266
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:58,415
It's likely roaming
around this area even now.

267
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,794
We might've had a chance
against a sleeping dragon.

268
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,922
But do you really think we could defeat it
with our current strength?

269
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,174
What if we lose again?

270
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,426
{\an8}What if she's already digested?

271
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,844
Calm down.

272
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,137
We don't know that yet.

273
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,931
Let's figure out a plan first.

274
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,849
But taking on the dragon

275
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,435
with just the three of you
is gonna be tough.

276
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,646
The three of us?

277
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,443
{\an8}I keep telling you this,
but don't count on me to help in combat!

278
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,446
{\an8}My only job
is to get you to your destination!

279
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,823
{\an8}We know that.

280
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,741
{\an8}We're not blaming you.

281
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,952
{\an8}M-My mistake then.

282
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,372
How have you defeated dragons in the past?

283
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,333
It depends on the time, circumstances,
and the type of dragon.

284
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,837
<i>But usually, Falin casts a spell
to protect against fire and harm.</i>

285
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,381
<i>Then, Namari, Shuro, and I
work to slow it down.</i>

286
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:50,342
<i>Marcille weakens the dragon
with explosive spells.</i>

287
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,345
<i>Finally, Shuro strikes the killing blow
when the opportunity arises.</i>

288
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,015
I think that's how it usually goes.

289
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,852
{\an8}Of course, it was only possible
because of that team.

290
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:03,355
Now, we have to figure out a plan
for just the three of us.

291
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,817
<i>Dragons are resistant
to spells and weapons.</i>

292
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,987
<i>It's because they're covered
in steel-like scales.</i>

293
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,114
<i>Their only weak spot
where you can land a killing blow</i>

294
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,742
<i>is the underside of their neck.</i>

295
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,869
Stab it there, and we win!

296
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,495
The underside of their neck, huh?

297
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,124
How large is this Red Dragon?

298
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,709
Let's see…

299
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,753
Look over there.

300
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,713
See that half-collapsed walkway?

301
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,381
It's about that tall.

302
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,507
I mean,

303
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,719
isn't it broken
because the dragon bumped its head on it?

304
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,262
You're right.

305
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,722
It's massive.

306
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:40,392
Striking it at that height
is almost impossible.

307
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,019
That's exactly the problem.

308
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,981
Let's make our way to the walkway.

309
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,943
It's so high.

310
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,446
What if we try jumping
onto the dragon's neck from here?

311
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,531
-No way!
-Forget it.

312
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,867
I can cast defense spells,

313
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,994
but I'm not as skilled as Falin.

314
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,872
I can't protect you
from a fall from this height

315
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,540
or from fire breath.

316
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,418
Yeah, what about its fire breath?

317
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,045
Up here, there's nowhere for us to run.

318
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:10,422
And according to Namari,

319
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,925
Senshi's axe won't even
make a dent in the dragon.

320
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,677
Are you sure your sword
can hurt it, Laios?

321
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,389
To cast an explosive spell
strong enough to stun a dragon,

322
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,850
I'll need you to buy me a lot of time.

323
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,686
On top of that,
someone needs to land the killing blow.

324
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,232
Can you and Senshi handle all that?

325
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,109
We'll find a way somehow.

326
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,485
How?

327
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,573
{\an8}Rather than aiming for its head,

328
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,326
{\an8}what if we blow up a building?

329
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,331
There are a lot of bridges and walkways
between buildings here.

330
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:47,084
We could set off an explosion
just as the dragon passes underneath.

331
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,628
The debris will trap the dragon,

332
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,797
bringing its weak spot within reach.

333
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,341
Then, we could strike
without worrying about a counterattack.

334
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:59,346
It's true that the two of us can't buy you
enough time to set up your spell.

335
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,850
But we could make a run for it
and lead the dragon on a chase.

336
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,019
The streets here are
too narrow for the Red Dragon,

337
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,856
and it's probably feeling worn out
after all its activity.

338
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,776
If we lead it along the right path,
we could tire it out even more.

339
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,111
I see.

340
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,529
I could help with that.

341
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,488
Really?

342
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,616
Thank you! You're the best!

343
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,327
Still, why isn't it sleeping?

344
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,621
Its appearance on the fifth floor
is a mystery, too.

345
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,916
It's persistently prowling
these narrow streets that it dislikes.

346
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,002
Could it be its mating season?

347
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,003
No…

348
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,505
Hey, didn't Namari mention something

349
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,757
about Senshi's pot
being made of seriously tough metal?

350
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,342
What was it again?

351
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,846
"It shields against a dragon's something
and can shatter a dragon's something."

352
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,472
You're right!

353
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,766
She said every blacksmith dreams of it!

354
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,685
If it shields
against a dragon's something,

355
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,936
it's gotta be fire breath!

356
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,398
Well, that solves the fire breath problem.

357
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,276
Isn't your cooking knife
made from special metal, too?

358
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,404
We should've had Namari take a look at it.

359
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,740
I'm feeling pretty hopeful now.

360
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,409
When you put your mind to it,
a way opens, huh?

361
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,368
All right!

362
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:05,537
Let's do our research
to map out our luring route!

363
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,016
{\an8}So, you're back.

364
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:29,311
{\an8}Senshi, you slipped away
without a heads-up!

365
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,812
I was making bread.

366
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,690
Did you have to do it right before
we're facing a dragon?

367
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,234
Absolutely.

368
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,361
We have a big mission ahead,

369
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,696
and the most important thing
is to fill our stomachs.

370
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,868
We lost to the Red Dragon
because of hunger once.

371
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,287
We shouldn't make the same mistake, right?

372
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,456
Wine!

373
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:52,459
I humbly took some from the pantry.

374
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,754
Save it for after we defeat the dragon.

375
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,923
We're missing eggs,

376
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,342
but these should be enough
to make that dish.

377
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,763
Grate the bread into crumbs,

378
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,517
and marinate the Giant Frog meat
with salt and pepper.

379
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,520
Dip it in a water and flour batter,

380
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,021
and coat it with bread crumbs.

381
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,024
Heat up some olive oil, and deep fry.

382
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,781
Boil down red wine
with seasoning to make a sauce.

383
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:27,119
{\an8}It's done!

384
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,538
{\an8}CUTLETS TO CONQUER THE RED DRAGON

385
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,872
That looks amazing!

386
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,792
The smell is making me hungry.

387
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,794
-Let's dig in!
-Let's dig in!

388
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,797
It's so crispy!

389
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,927
Are you okay, Marcille?

390
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,222
{\an8}The thought of not having
to eat monsters soon

391
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,557
{\an8}is making me emotional.

392
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,059
{\an8}There's still the Red Dragon, though.

393
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,774
Listen,

394
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,818
there's something
I want to say to you all.

395
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,322
I doubt I could've made it
all this way on my own.

396
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:06,074
Senshi, thank you so much.

397
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,952
You were kind
to complete strangers like us.

398
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,330
Your excellent cooking
not only satisfied our hunger

399
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,457
but it lifted our spirits as well.

400
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,877
Chilchuck, without you,
we would've had to take multiple detours,

401
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,670
which would have caused days of delay.

402
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,089
Above all, you were dependable.

403
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,924
And Marcille,

404
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,635
I'm sorry for the tough time you had
on this unfamiliar journey.

405
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:29,097
When you said you'd join me,
I was so moved.

406
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,809
Everyone, thank you so much.

407
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,939
-S-Sure.
-S-Sure.

408
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,982
Poor timing!

409
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,484
Sorry.

410
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,988
What's this?

411
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,133
Seeing it again, it really is huge.

412
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,595
Could we really defeat it?

413
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:10,931
Don't worry.

414
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,433
The four of us have made it this far.

415
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,895
As per the plan,
Marcille will take her position,

416
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,189
and we'll lure the dragon!

417
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,191
Is everyone ready?

418
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,193
Is everyone in good shape?

419
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,278
All right.

420
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,322
Let's go!

421
00:24:56,828 --> 00:25:00,916
