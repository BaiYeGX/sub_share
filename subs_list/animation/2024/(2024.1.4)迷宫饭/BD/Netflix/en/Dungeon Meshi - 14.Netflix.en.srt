1
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,815
DELICIOUS IN DUNGEON

2
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,802
<i>Laios and his crew agreed
to head back to the surface.</i>

3
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,845
<i>I don't want to lose you guys!</i>

4
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,555
<i>You guys…</i>

5
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,934
<i>The strength of their bonds
was reaffirmed.</i>

6
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,436
<i>A little earlier…</i>

7
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:47,315
Are you awake now?

8
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,567
Do you feel any discomfort?

9
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,570
You seem well enough.

10
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,532
You were low on blood,
so I used some goat blood.

11
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,783
But it's not ideal.

12
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,661
You should head back to town.

13
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,790
If you had stayed dead on the water,
you'd be fish bait by now.

14
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,793
You should thank whoever pulled you out.

15
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,837
Do you think it was…

16
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,088
Kuro!

17
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,343
I recognize these scents.

18
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:20,849
An elf, a tall-man,
a half-foot, and a dwarf.

19
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,642
The same folks who took our treasure.

20
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,435
I suspected it was them!

21
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,816
I require a revival fee.

22
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,694
I'll only charge you for the goat.

23
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,239
Right, I remember now.

24
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,741
We were attacked by Fish-men and…

25
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,333
So, we died again.

26
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,961
This will do.

27
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,046
<i>Are they adventurers?</i>

28
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,551
Are you…

29
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,469
What?

30
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,722
Nothing.

31
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,765
Let's go, Namari.

32
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,017
Yeah, coming.

33
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,230
You're even making eyes at a dwarf?

34
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,441
You have no standards.

35
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,987
Well, I've never picked my friends
based on how tall they are.

36
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,905
Is that so?

37
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,657
Our provisions are gone!

38
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,910
They must've stolen from us again!

39
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:22,827
Food.

40
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,203
How dare they!

41
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,747
Not again.

42
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,875
They've taken our food but left our money?

43
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,211
Maybe they've depleted their own supplies.

44
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,670
Infuriating.

45
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,756
We need to take them to task.

46
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,216
What do we do, Kabru?

47
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,510
We've got no other option.

48
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,637
Let's head back to town.

49
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,472
What? Seriously?

50
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,057
Without catching the thieves?

51
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,894
We're out of provisions,
so we can't push on.

52
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,104
Let's admit our own lack of skills.

53
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,774
Just like those people said,

54
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,109
we should be thankful
we're still breathing.

55
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,490
If that's your call, Kabru, I'm with you.

56
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:01,616
Same here.

57
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:05,203
If you promise you won't forget
about finding those thieves,

58
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,621
I'll follow your lead.

59
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,873
You have my word, Rin.

60
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,084
Kuro will follow Mickbell.

61
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,840
{\an8}We're going to be deep in the red
after this expedition.

62
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,350
It's getting foggy.

63
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,852
Everyone, watch out--

64
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,277
<i>This isn't a natural fog.</i>

65
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,279
<i>Could a monster be causing this?</i>

66
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,787
<i>A Fish-man?</i>

67
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:51,165
<i>Where did they come from?</i>

68
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,419
<i>Dammit. I'll have to fight.</i>

69
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,921
<i>Here it comes!</i>

70
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,264
<i>The way it wields its axe
like it's mowing something down…</i>

71
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,892
<i>I know it very well.</i>

72
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,061
<i>Yes.</i>

73
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,563
<i>It's…</i>

74
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:19,986
Shh!

75
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,613
It's okay. Calm down.

76
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,699
Daya, it's me.

77
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,704
<i>This fog is illusion magic.</i>

78
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,750
<i>The confused one
with the drawn weapon has to be Kuro.</i>

79
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,586
<i>And the one standing in a daze is Holm.</i>

80
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,589
<i>He tends to freeze
when too much happens all at once.</i>

81
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,550
<i>And the one who bolted earlier
must be Mick.</i>

82
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:46,137
<i>In that case, the biggest threat here is…</i>

83
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,514
<i>Rin.</i>

84
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,767
<i>Just as I feared,
she's chanting something.</i>

85
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,270
<i>She has the power
to reduce us all to cinders.</i>

86
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,149
<i>The only way to peacefully
interrupt a mage's incantation is…</i>

87
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:05,531
{\an8}Rinsha.

88
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:08,326
Do you see? This is an illusion.

89
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,038
<i>It's a shame she's
in the form of a monster.</i>

90
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:16,542
<i>Now then, how do we
dispel this illusionary fog?</i>

91
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,971
<i>It's not this one.</i>

92
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,808
<i>A spellcaster wouldn't
come charging with a weapon.</i>

93
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,561
<i>They'd observe from a distance.</i>

94
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:36,979
<i>That one!</i>

95
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,106
What?

96
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,828
You got us.

97
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,829
We surrender.

98
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,040
Let him go, will you?

99
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,251
These guys…

100
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,337
<i>They are the corpse retrievers
we ran into on the upper floor!</i>

101
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,132
This isn't a chance reunion, is it?

102
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,883
You were following us, right?

103
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,010
What do you mean?

104
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,222
Retrieving bodies
in the lower levels pays better,

105
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,141
thanks to Island subsidies.

106
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,979
<i>We were intent
on getting our stolen loot back</i>

107
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,356
<i>and entered a level we weren't ready for.</i>

108
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,109
All they had to do
was leisurely follow our trail

109
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,403
for more lucrative corpses.

110
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,863
Oh.

111
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,281
Infuriating.

112
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,949
But you guys were a little too slow.

113
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,327
<i>By the time you found us,
we were already resurrected</i>

114
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,455
<i>and on our way back to the surface.</i>

115
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,583
<i>You got antsy
and resorted to extreme measures.</i>

116
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,877
<i>You used magic
to make us turn on each other.</i>

117
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,753
Close, but not quite.

118
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:45,756
Actually, it would've been ideal
if you caught up with your thieves

119
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,551
and fought with them
and killed each other.

120
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,511
But what a letdown.

121
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:54,265
We didn't think you'd get taken out
by monsters so quickly.

122
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,392
You…!

123
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,313
Stealing from and attacking
fellow adventurers is a serious offense.

124
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,356
I'll be reporting this
to the Lord of the Island.

125
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,027
How about we make a deal?

126
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,821
Going back empty-handed
would be a loss for you.

127
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,700
Two of our comrades
are lying dead over there.

128
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,578
Take them to the resurrection office.

129
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,122
You should be able to make a tidy sum.

130
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,791
They're only unconscious.

131
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,880
I'll testify that they
were attacked by Fish-men.

132
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,007
Our share would be…

133
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,884
Let's see, 40…

134
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,512
No, 30% will do.

135
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:33,930
What do you say?

136
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,765
It's not a bad deal for you.

137
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,186
Fine. Deal.

138
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,397
Kabru…

139
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:56,661
You bastard!

140
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,704
I'm not surprised.

141
00:08:58,788 --> 00:08:59,914
That's our Kabru!

142
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,303
Humans really are easy to kill.

143
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:19,267
Tall-man, dwarf, gnome,
they all share the same weak points.

144
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,477
Even their movements are similar.

145
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,105
If only monsters were the same,
it'd make things simpler.

146
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,567
Kuro, could you go find Mick?

147
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,651
Woof!

148
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,735
Kabru.

149
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,320
What do we do with him?

150
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,698
P-Please let me go.

151
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,491
I didn't know anything!

152
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,328
You don't care about
breaking the curse on the dungeon

153
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,747
or exterminating monsters.

154
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,502
More and more people are making
a quick buck by robbing others.

155
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,880
At this rate, decent people
will leave the Island.

156
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,636
That's why
I can't forgive people like you.

157
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,388
Please don't.

158
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:16,574
Kabru.

159
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,036
Sorry about what I did earlier.

160
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,704
It was the only thing I could think of.

161
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,082
What are you talking about?

162
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,917
I don't know and I don't care to know.

163
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,169
That's a relief.

164
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,506
I'm growing impatient,
and we're not making much progress.

165
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:33,966
You're right.

166
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,177
And this is where our impatience led us.

167
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,803
It sucks.

168
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,306
Can't you offer some encouragement
once in a while?

169
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,600
There's no use sugarcoating it.

170
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,810
This is the reality of our abilities.

171
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,940
The Lord of the Island only sees
the dungeon as a profitable pit.

172
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,026
Even if it runs out of treasure,

173
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,737
he believes he can get by
on monster hides and bones.

174
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:59,116
But the truth is, no one will enter
the dungeon once it's fully explored.

175
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,203
Either because
there's no fortune to be made

176
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,789
or because it doesn't excite
the adventurous spirit.

177
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,417
Fewer and fewer people will be here.

178
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,921
<i>Monsters will spill out
from the dungeon and attack citizens.</i>

179
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:16,300
That's how many settlements
have fallen into ruin.

180
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,637
We must lift the curse
on the dungeon quickly.

181
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,473
There's no room for monsters
or dungeons in this world.

182
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,016
Yeah.

183
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,603
I'm hungry.

184
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:30,564
Being resurrected
makes you hungry, doesn't it?

185
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,483
Kabru!

186
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,611
{\an8}Those guys had
quite a bit of valuables on them!

187
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,904
All right.

188
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,698
Take their food,
but toss the rest into the lake.

189
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,700
What? Are you serious?

190
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,288
If we took their valuables,
we'd be no better than them.

191
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,583
Once that's done, let's have a light meal.

192
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,585
-Sounds good.
-Sounds good.

193
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,921
ADVENTURERS' RATIONS
SALTED MEAT

194
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:56,006
BREAD, WINE, NUTS AND DRIED FRUITS

195
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,008
-Let's dig in!
-Let's dig in!

196
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,760
Yum!

197
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,804
They're eating pretty well.

198
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,014
Corpse retrievers
make a pretty penny, huh?

199
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:07,184
Especially if they're the ones creating
the corpses and bringing them back.

200
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,645
But won't the Lord of the Island catch on?

201
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:13,149
There's a screening process
to claim rewards from the Island.

202
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,402
They must've been pretty clever
to slip through that.

203
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:22,491
Or maybe they're in cahoots
with more parties than we realize.

204
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,910
That's so rotten.

205
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,413
In the end, they're just
digging their own grave.

206
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:29,165
Will you inform the Lord of the Island?

207
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:32,668
I doubt that Lord will come up
with a good solution.

208
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,046
Newbies like Doni will end up
getting the short end of the stick.

209
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:39,800
If only that stupid Lord
gains so much weight that he pops.

210
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,053
Then the elves will come swooping in.

211
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,307
We still need him
to hold out as a bulwark.

212
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:52,313
Anyway, a tall-man, a dwarf,
a half-foot, and an elf, huh?

213
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,564
What's this about?

214
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,067
The party that cast
a ghost-warding spell on us.

215
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,195
You mean those treasure thieves.

216
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,988
Food robbers.

217
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,866
There aren't many parties with an elf.

218
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,076
We could identify them
with some narrowing down.

219
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,579
Do you think it's Doni and Fionil?

220
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,166
It's hard to imagine them
venturing down to the third floor.

221
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,544
And I find it odd
that they're only a party of four.

222
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,588
It's rather reckless of them.

223
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,757
Rin, Holm.

224
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,092
Do you notice anything
about this ghost-warding spell?

225
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:23,886
You still have it on?

226
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,846
I mean, it's evidence.

227
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,349
I'm not familiar with spells like that.

228
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,851
Let me take a look.

229
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,273
It screams "honor student."

230
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,901
It looks like it's
straight out of a textbook.

231
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,111
And whoever did it wasn't used to it.

232
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,489
They might even be
a magic school graduate.

233
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,784
All graduates produce similar spells.

234
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,662
And there's no doubt
it's the work of an elf.

235
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,373
Magic school…

236
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:56,377
Hmm, magic school, huh?

237
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,670
Interesting.

238
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,879
What? What is it?

239
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:02,091
Well, I have a hunch
about whose party this might be.

240
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,635
It's just a guess, but

241
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,929
I'd be thrilled if I'm right.

242
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,848
Out with it. Cut the drama.

243
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,141
Well,

244
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,477
{\an8}I think it's the party
with the Touden siblings.

245
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,813
Touden? You mean those two?

246
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,732
They don't strike me as the criminal type.

247
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,900
What's your reasoning?

248
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:24,905
First, if I remember correctly,
the sister is a magic school graduate.

249
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,867
But the one who cast
the ghost-warding spell was an elf.

250
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,702
And those siblings are tall-men.

251
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,288
Hold on, let me finish.

252
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,292
<i>The elf in their party
seemed pretty close to the sister,</i>

253
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,378
<i>as if they were childhood friends.</i>

254
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,382
<i>So I figured they must've attended
the same magic school.</i>

255
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,177
Magic school graduates
are rare around here,

256
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,804
especially if they're an elf.

257
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,141
I suppose it's possible.

258
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:53,851
But it's not enough to go on.

259
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:57,271
Plus, Kuro only smelled one tall-man.

260
00:14:57,354 --> 00:14:59,189
If they're siblings,
he should've smelled two.

261
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,444
{\an8}Are you suggesting that's why
they're venturing with a small group?

262
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,363
{\an8}Exactly! One of the siblings got lost,

263
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,700
{\an8}and there was a disagreement in the party
about whether to rescue them.

264
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:13,704
I think so because we just crossed paths
with a former member of their group.

265
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,750
<i>They had disputes over their goals
and income even before this.</i>

266
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,378
<i>And maybe this incident
led some of them to leave.</i>

267
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,048
<i>Now desperate, they're resorting
to stealing treasure and food.</i>

268
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,468
-You're starting to convince me.
-Right?

269
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:31,847
But Kuro, you mentioned
catching a whiff of a dwarf too.

270
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,974
I did. Strong dwarf scent.

271
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,392
That's odd then.

272
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,394
Why would they still
have a dwarf with them?

273
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,647
Maybe they recruited another one.

274
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,733
Who else is in their party?

275
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,734
Let's see.

276
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,153
<i>The tall-men are Laios, Falin,</i>

277
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,864
<i>and probably Shuro, an Easterner.</i>

278
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,991
<i>There's Namari, the dwarf we saw earlier,</i>

279
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,159
<i>and Marcille the elf.</i>

280
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,829
<i>I think the half-foot's name
was Chilchuck or something.</i>

281
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,791
<i>Assuming this is
the Touden siblings' party,</i>

282
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,127
<i>one of their siblings,
as well as Shuro and Namari, departed.</i>

283
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,546
<i>And another dwarf joined them, I think.</i>

284
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,759
I see. So the woman back there was Namari.

285
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,054
Do you know anything about her, Daya?

286
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,430
Only her name.

287
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,556
She's pretty well-known.

288
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,184
She's the only daughter of a guy
known as the "Arms Dealer."

289
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,560
"Arms Dealer"?

290
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,647
He used to control
the arms trade on this Island.

291
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,068
<i>But one day, he was found
embezzling a hefty sum and vanished.</i>

292
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,070
<i>They say he's one of the reasons</i>

293
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,406
<i>the Lord of the Island
has a negative view of dwarves now.</i>

294
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,617
A lot of dwarves suffered because of him.

295
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,411
Including me.

296
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,665
No honorable dwarf
would want to follow in his footsteps.

297
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,917
{\an8}So maybe she's not an honorable dwarf.

298
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,837
{\an8}The scent I caught was intense.

299
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,881
{\an8}I know something about this Chilchuck guy.

300
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,675
{\an8}He's a middle-aged fellow,

301
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:53,053
{\an8}but he acts like he's the representative
for all the half-foots on this Island.

302
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:57,016
<i>He's a greedy guy who insists
on making contracts through the guild</i>

303
00:16:57,099 --> 00:17:00,060
<i>and paying broker fees.</i>

304
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,439
I want no part of that,
so I'm steering clear.

305
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,568
I mean, if he found out I hired a Kobold,
I'd get an earful for sure.

306
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,194
You wouldn't want that, right?

307
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,447
You want me to keep hiring you, don't you?

308
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,990
Mick gives me food.

309
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,199
Mick is a good boss.

310
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,871
I bet he's working him hard
for measly wages.

311
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,957
Holm, you shouldn't
make assumptions like that.

312
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,711
{\an8}Anyway, Rin, the Eastern tall-man
is from your neck of the woods.

313
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,421
Maybe you know each other.

314
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,464
Oh, please.

315
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:30,799
Don't group us together
just because we're both Easterners.

316
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,761
Depending on the region,
we don't even speak the same language.

317
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,555
And Shuro isn't a name from my island.

318
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,475
I might have more information on him then.

319
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,728
<i>He was a bit of a loner
even in Touden's crew.</i>

320
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,189
<i>He came to the Island
with a few other Easterners,</i>

321
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,733
<i>then joined Touden's party alone.</i>

322
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,277
<i>He gave off this vibe
that he wasn't your average person,</i>

323
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,238
<i>and it seemed like he was venturing
into the dungeon to test his skills.</i>

324
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,116
But he left the party, huh?

325
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,495
He didn't strike me as someone
concerned about rewards or dangers.

326
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,582
Could it be that both siblings left,
and he's still in the party?

327
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:04,875
Nah, that's unlikely.

328
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,545
Kabru, you remember details about people
to the point where it's creepy.

329
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,130
Why do you sound so excited?

330
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,633
Because it's fun. It's really exciting!

331
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:17,513
There are countless people on this Island,
each with their own motives.

332
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,766
But when their entirely
different actions intersect,

333
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,186
it sparks a historic event
involving a whole lot of people.

334
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,313
I thought this was just
a boring case of theft,

335
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,899
but I sense something interesting
is about to happen.

336
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,860
I hope this crew
is the Touden siblings' party.

337
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,655
Because for a long time now,

338
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,908
I've been itching
to see their true colors revealed.

339
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,160
{\an8}Do you have a grudge
against them or something?

340
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,162
It's not like they've wronged me.

341
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:45,874
<i>In the past, Laios apparently
made a fortune in a gold-peeling crew.</i>

342
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,960
<i>But he was sharing most of his earnings</i>

343
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,171
<i>with comrades who couldn't enter
the dungeon due to illness or injury.</i>

344
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,173
{\an8}That's noble of him.

345
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,008
Yes, it's a touching story.

346
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,177
But there's more to it.

347
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,181
<i>His comrades had long recovered,
but kept taking the money.</i>

348
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,184
<i>In the end,
they never returned to adventuring</i>

349
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,937
<i>and now peddle
smuggled goods on the Island.</i>

350
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,357
"I shall bestow everything to whoever
defeats the lord of the dungeon."

351
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,777
That's what some king-like figure
of this country supposedly said.

352
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,906
{\an8}Regardless of whether you could
truly obtain everything or not,

353
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,577
{\an8}this dungeon itself
is a legacy left by ancient elves.

354
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,454
{\an8}I'm sure it holds significant power.

355
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:29,001
That's why I don't think it should
fall into the hands of those siblings.

356
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,461
<i>They're not saints.</i>

357
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,255
<i>They're just indifferent to people.</i>

358
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,757
<i>Just like the Lord of the Island.</i>

359
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,302
We know, Kabru.

360
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,721
We believe you're the only one.

361
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,223
The only one to drive out
that stupid Lord as well.

362
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:46,226
{\an8}But if you're still struggling
with monsters in this area,

363
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,478
{\an8}you've got a long road ahead of you.

364
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,272
You're right.

365
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,399
Well then, shall we get going soon?

366
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,194
May we make it back without any issues.

367
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:01,950
Whoa! That was close!

368
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:02,868
Blade Fish!

369
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,579
Don't let them distract you!

370
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,372
Watch your step!

371
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,837
<i>A Kraken? No, it's a Sea Serpent!</i>

372
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,088
Rin! Get back!

373
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,256
Incant--

374
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,258
Holm!

375
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,719
I can't summon her in this situation!

376
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,471
There's no telling
what might get mixed in!

377
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,976
<i>Don't panic.</i>

378
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,062
<i>It's up to you to do something, Kabru.</i>

379
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,981
<i>It's not a creature
that makes complicated movements.</i>

380
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:36,360
<i>Observe its motions,
and aim for its carotid artery.</i>

381
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,279
<i>Wait, where's its carotid artery?</i>

382
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,239
Excuse me.

383
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,117
Tade!

384
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,285
On it!

385
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,458
Young Master, it's in your court!

386
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,508
Young Master!

387
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,135
That was impressive.

388
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,221
Is your armor damaged?

389
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,138
No.

390
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,348
You must be weary.

391
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,433
How about something to eat?

392
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,269
No. Let's press forward.

393
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,272
What are we going to do
with the Young Master?

394
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,566
He's completely besotted
with that Northern girl.

395
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,528
Tade is hungry.

396
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,863
Kabru, are you hurt?

397
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,198
Change of plans.

398
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,451
It might be tasty stewed with daikon!

399
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,161
-That's dumb.
-Excuse me.

400
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,915
You saved me back there. Thank you.

401
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,250
I'm Kabru.

402
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:35,127
May I ask your names?

403
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,420
Don't mention it.

404
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,171
We were just passing through.

405
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,924
If I'm not mistaken,

406
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,427
you're searching for a woman.

407
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,555
D-Do you know something?

408
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,142
Just as I thought. My deepest sympathies.

409
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:53,061
I might be able to assist you

410
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,148
in your search for Falin Touden.

411
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,400
Stop it, Kuro!

412
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,819
Didn't I tell you
not to make that expression?

413
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,987
It's frightening!

414
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,364
What's gotten into you?

415
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,158
<i>And so, Kabru and his crew</i>

416
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,910
<i>decided to venture deeper
into the dungeon once again.</i>

417
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:09,995
NOW

418
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,456
<i>Turning back time to Laios and his party,</i>

419
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,958
<i>two full days have passed
since they agreed to head back.</i>

420
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,419
It's a dead end.

421
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,421
Another dead end.

422
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,883
I'm famished.

423
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,342
I'm exhausted.

424
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,427
I'm parched.

425
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,805
<i>They were lost and on the brink of death.</i>

426
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,939
