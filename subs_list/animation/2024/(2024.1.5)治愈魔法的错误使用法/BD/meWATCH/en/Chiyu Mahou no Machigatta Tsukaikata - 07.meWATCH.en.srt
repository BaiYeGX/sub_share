00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:06,798
Hey!

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:08,175
Wait a minute!

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,265
<i>What was that just now?</i>

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:18,060
<i>Why were Inukami-senpai and Kazuki dead?!</i>

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:20,896
<i>I have to ask her!</i>

6
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,194
I'm begging you...

7
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,695
Only you can change the future.

<i>They're not there to overwhelm you.</i>

00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:06,472
<i>They're there for you to overcome.</i>

13
00:01:07,849 --> 00:01:10,852

00:01:10,852 --> 00:01:12,937

A fox beastman girl?

00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,542
No, I haven't seen her come this way.
(#7 The Night of Resolve!)

30
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,628
I guess not.

31
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,630
She was still young...

32
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:12,174
she couldn't have gotten far.

33
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,677
Damn it! Where did that little fox go?

34
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,013
What's with all the commotion?

35
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,223
Captain?

36
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:23,018
I-I'll head back to my post!

37
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,227
Don't mind me!

38
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:29,566
Thomas-san, he's still scared of you, huh?

39
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,444
Not like I can't understand him.

40
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,823
Ouch! Ouch! Ow, ow, ow!

41
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,158
Just what do you understand?

42
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,158
Come again?

43
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,120
Stop! Nothing! Nothing at all!

44
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,123
Where have you been, anyway?

45
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,043
Just a short trip to the border.

46
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,086
Scouting.

47
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:50,879
Scouting?

48
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,255
It's the Demon Lord's Army.

49
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:56,009
They were trying to cross
the river by building a bridge.

50
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,095
Wait. Does that mean...?

51
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,473
I destroyed their bridge, so we
should be all right for the time being.

52
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,393
What part of that is scout--

53
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:09,147
My head! It's going to explode!

54
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,566
A fox beastman?

55
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,068
Oh, her.

56
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,945
You know her?

57
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:17,406
Not personally...

58
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,410
That girl appeared here two years ago.

59
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,912
She's only around 12.

60
00:03:22,913 --> 00:03:25,080
Yet, she made it here all by herself,

61
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:27,376
evading all the bandits and kidnappers.

62
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,293
Kidnappers?

63
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:34,089
Demi-humans are extremely
valuable to them.

64
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,718
Not only are they prized
for their physical appearance,

65
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:41,304
some even have
an aptitude for rare magic.

66
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,268
Does that include the ability
to show others strange visions?

67
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:49,187
Visions? Like what?

68
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,648
How should I put this...

69
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,692
Like a nightmare.

70
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:57,446
Like a future you hope
never comes to pass.

71
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,364
Future, huh?

72
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:04,536
There are supposedly beastmen who
can use a magic called precognition...

73
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,037
Precognition?

74
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,206
They're extremely rare.

75
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:12,627
Even if such beastmen did exist, they'd
be well-guarded back in the Beastlands.

76
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,920
What about it?

77
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,841
O-oh, it's nothing. I was just
reading about them in a book.

78
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,217
Right...

79
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,429
<i>Beastmen who can see into the future...</i>

80
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,265
<i>What if that girl was one of them?</i>

81
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:26,933
Huh?

82
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,728
I'm going to see Lloyd-sama.

83
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:31,313
You head back first.

84
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,106
All right...

85
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,278
That is all I have to report.

86
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,238
I see.

87
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,825
I apologize for putting you in danger.

88
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,579
Thank you for halting their advance.

89
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:48,955
It was nothing.

90
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:52,709
But they should be
working on a new bridge.

91
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,295
It will be completed in a few days.

92
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:59,508
Indeed. And they will
begin their invasion.

93
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:08,850
Tomorrow, we will inform the soldiers
and the citizens of the invasion.

94
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,477
Sergio, begin the preparations.

95
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,145
As you command.

96
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:17,317
Siglis, I want to have a word with Suzune
and Kazuki before the night is up.

97
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,318
Call them here at once.

98
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,402
Right away.

99
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,907
What do you think this
urgent matter's about?

100
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:26,117
Well, it's probably...

101
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:27,828
what else could it be?

102
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,539
You think so?

103
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,920
Hey, Celia. Good evening.

104
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,048
Good evening, Suzune-sama.

105
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,217
You, too, Kazuki-sama.

106
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,095
E-evening...

107
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:47,305
Celia... -san.

108
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,351
My father is waiting.

109
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:53,895
You may go see him now.

110
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,649
Thanks! We'll see you later, then.

111
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,234
Come, Kazuki-kun.

112
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,610
Right...

113
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,492
Did something happen
between the two of you?

114
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,910
Wha...?

115
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,495
No, nothing happened.

116
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:13,623
Well, if you say so.

117
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,209
All right, let's do this.

118
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,377
Let's.

119
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,729
<i>I can't sleep</i>

120
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,774
<i>Even if that was a
vision of the future, </i>

121
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,027
<i>what can I do about it?</i>

122
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,364
That is why this is
a future you can change.

123
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:51,620
<i>Does that mean I can
prevent it from happening?</i>

124
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,081
<i>She wants me to change the future?</i>

125
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,209
<i>But there's no way I can do that...</i>

126
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,006
Huh? W-what is that?

127
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,299
A ghost?

128
00:07:16,127 --> 00:07:17,437
Kazuki?

129
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,108
I didn't expect to see you
at this time of night!

130
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,318
My bad.

131
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:25,903
You've got to get up
early to train, right?

132
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,740
Nah, it's all right.

133
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:32,577
You're in no position
to sleep in either, right?

134
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,162
I mean, you're the great hero!

135
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,999
Something wrong?

136
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:43,088
Just now, we were called up by the king.

137
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,923
And he told us...

138
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:48,551
that the battle with the
Demon Lord's Army will soon begin.

139
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,013
I was expecting it,
so I wasn't all too surprised.

140
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,517
Senpai was already raring to go.

141
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,186
As for me?

142
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,189
As for me...

143
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:04,401
when I pictured myself fighting,

144
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:07,612
I couldn't fall asleep
and ran out of the castle.

145
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,947
Now, here I am.

146
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,910
I... ran away.

147
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,622
Usato, I'm...

148
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,416
scared...

149
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,334
to fight.

150
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,505
When I left the kingdom to train...

151
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,716
When I fought monsters for real...

152
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,509
I was really scared.

153
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,513
My legs froze up when
I saw them for the first time.

154
00:08:33,702 --> 00:08:38,310
They put up a fierce resistance, and
when I finally managed to defeat them...

155
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,273
I... realized.

156
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,818
I realized just how lightly
I've been taking everything.

157
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,904
The Demon Lord's Army will try
to kill me with everything they've got.

158
00:08:51,099 --> 00:08:53,116
I'm just so unbelievably scared.

159
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:59,706
And yet... the people of this
kingdom are so kind to me.

160
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,292
They support me and are counting on me.

161
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,911
I can't stand it!

162
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,924
Kazuki...

163
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:11,468
you're a really cool guy, you know?

164
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,719
What?

165
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:18,183
I thought you always knew
what to do and never got scared.

166
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,351
I mean, you're a cool guy, right?

167
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,270
I get scared, too!

168
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,605
Of course, you do.

169
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,606
I know that now.

170
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:30,403
The expectations of those
around you have been a burden.

171
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:31,613
Usato.

172
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,699
You don't have to, you know?

173
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,494
You don't have to keep
living up to those expectations.

174
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:41,372
Sometimes, it's all right
to put yourself first.

175
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,627
Usato, what about you?

176
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:49,464
Tell me what you really feel.

177
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,305
I'm going.

178
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,684
I'm going to save those who
will fight the Demon Lord's Army.

179
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,354
Aren't you scared?

180
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,523
Of course, I am.

181
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,818
But that is what I decided.

182
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,694
Decided?

183
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,113
Are you serious?

184
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:14,864
You could die!

185
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,785
You were just dragged
into all this by accident!

186
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:23,873
That might be how I got here...

187
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:28,419
but I've experienced
many things since then.

188
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,216
There were some tough times,

189
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,844
but I've also met many people...

190
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:40,306
people who accepted me
and showed me the way.

191
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,934
I want to help them.

192
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,019
Usato...

193
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,647
That includes you, too.

194
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,191
Obviously!

195
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:53,319
It doesn't matter if you fight or not.

196
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,697
You're still my friend either way.

197
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,293
I'm so lame!

198
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,003
All right.

199
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,464
I'm going to fight to protect
both you and Senpai.

200
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,802
I don't know if I can fight as a hero,

201
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,305
but I'll fight nonetheless!

202
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:24,058
I want to help my friends... to help you!

203
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:28,980
W-wait! I know what I said,
but are you sure?

204
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,107
I can't just sit here with
my tail between my legs

205
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,484
when you're already
resolved to fight, can I?

206
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,612
I'll charge right ahead!

207
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:39,574
Take my fear and fight... in spite of it!

208
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,951
Are you really sure?

209
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,682
When I think about having
both you and Senpai by my side,

210
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:47,916
I couldn't be more reassured!

211
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,626
I'll be all right now!

212
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:51,628
That's good to hear.

213
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,047
Well then...

214
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,673
let's do this together!

215
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,599
Protect this kingdom...

216
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,237
and everyone in it!

217
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,385
Yeah,

218
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,054
you got it!

219
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,643
I-I just said something
really corny, didn't I?

220
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,562
What are you talking about?

221
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:12,482
I'm really glad I met you!

222
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,399
Thanks for everything!

223
00:12:15,105 --> 00:12:18,363
Kazuki, you're way too cool
for your own good!

224
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,198
No, <i>you're</i> the cool one!

225
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,078
Good night, and thank you, Usato!

226
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,496
Sure, any time!

227
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,087
Time to hit the hay.

228
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,215
I'll forget I ever said those corny lines.

229
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,008
Yup. That's what I'll do.

230
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,179
So, <i>that's</i> what you call bromance, huh?

231
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,473
That was quite the show!

232
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,934
I'm sorry, but I'm sleepy.

233
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:50,937
Can we do this tomorrow, Inukami-senpai?

234
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,648
Huh? That's all?

235
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:54,691
Isn't this where you go...

236
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,402
"Oh! It's Suzu-tan! Why's she here?!"

237
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,737
...or am I mistaken?

238
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:03,116
When have I ever called you "Suzu-tan"?

239
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,326
This is you we're talking about.

240
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,037
I bet you noticed Kazuki acting weird.

241
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,498
You then got worried
and followed him here.

242
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,126
That's pretty much it.

243
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,128
But there's nothing left for me to do.

244
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,755
Looks like you've managed
to snap him out of it.

245
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,679
To be honest, there's still a part of me
that doesn't want him to fight.

246
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,604
Usato-kun. Would you rather I not fight?

247
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,315
Of course.

248
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,318
But your situation is different.

249
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:42,613
You've already made up your mind
to live in this world.

250
00:13:44,628 --> 00:13:46,492
Yup. Guess you're right.

251
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,537
Time for me to get back to the castle.

252
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,749
It's going to be a big day tomorrow.

253
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,126
Night!

254
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,545
Thanks. Good night to you, too.

255
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,634
I have a proclamation to make today!

256
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:09,182
The Demon Lord's Army has
been sighted near the border.

257
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,143
It is only a matter of time
before they invade.

258
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:16,856
We plan to intercept them
in the grasslands.

259
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:21,277
Two years ago, our troops successfully
repelled the Demon Lord's Army.

260
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:25,490
Our enemy has undoubtedly
strengthened their forces.

261
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,117
This time, it will not be as easy.

262
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,744
However!

263
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,330
We have also strengthened our forces.

264
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,124
We have Hero Suzune and Hero Kazuki,

265
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,336
two heroes summoned from another world

266
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,421
who have pledged their powers to help us.

267
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:45,426
We also have those from the Rescue Squad
who played a critical role two years ago!

268
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:51,974
They are sure to do so once again with
their healing magic on the battlefield.

269
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,853
I am sure some of you are worried.

270
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,273
But... I am not!

271
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:03,361
Our kingdom <i>will</i> emerge victorious!

272
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,365
That is because... I know our soldiers!

273
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:11,994
They are brave, strong, and fearless.

274
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,832
And they are standing right before me!

275
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,042
Tomorrow, we fight!

276
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,002
And we will...

277
00:15:20,003 --> 00:15:21,254
win!

278
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:38,020
Celia-sama,

279
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:40,106
Hero Kazuki is here to see you.

280
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,946
Kazuki-sama.

281
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,615
I beg your pardon...

282
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,658
for coming unannounced.

283
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,245
No, I am glad.

284
00:15:56,998 --> 00:16:00,585
You're going, are you not? Into battle?

285
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,837
Yes, I am. Together with everyone else.

286
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,088
We depart tomorrow.

287
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,263
I will pray for your success in battle.

288
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,682
Thank you very much.

289
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,643
I swear to protect this country
from the Demon Lord's Army.

290
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,817
I'll be back... Celia.

291
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,656
Good luck, Kazuki-sama.

292
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,701
Please come back safe.

293
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:34,827
I will.

294
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,716
Wow! So cute!

295
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,052
So, <i>this</i> is the Blurin
everyone's been talking about!

296
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,470
Can I pet him?

297
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,764
Fine by me.

298
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,225
But I'm not sure if he will let you.

299
00:16:57,391 --> 00:17:01,521
It's fine! I'm sure we'll be fast friends!

300
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:06,234
Sorry! He's not good with new people!

301
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,782
Why?

302
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,200
Kukuru-chan!

303
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,952
Will you console me?

304
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:16,953
Thank--

305
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,294
Why?!

306
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,880
O-Orga-san?!

307
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,131
Are you all right?

308
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,552
Th-thank you, Usato-kun.

309
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:36,472
Sorry for the trouble we're causing you.

310
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,015
Not at all.

311
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,893
She's certainly a cheerful one.

312
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,396
She's actually pretty nervous right now.

313
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:48,651
Just like you, it's her
first time in battle.

314
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:52,071
That's just her way of hiding her anxiety.

315
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,532
I see...

316
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,117
Hey, Usato!

317
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,868
Big Sis wants to see ya in her room.

318
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,663
Her room? The captain's quarters?

319
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,832
Where else?

320
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:08,587
I've never been called up
to her room before...

321
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,799
What is she going to do to me?
Is it finally torture time?

322
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,219
Hell if I know. Get movin'.

323
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,143
May I come in? It's Usato.

324
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,311
Enter!

325
00:18:32,185 --> 00:18:33,404
You were looking for me?

326
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,533
We need to talk.

327
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,872
Do you remember what
your role on the battlefield is?

328
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,206
Let's see...

329
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:48,794
to heal the injured together
with you on the front lines.

330
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,379
That's right.

331
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,798
But we will not do so at the beginning.

332
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,594
Tong and the others will ferry
the wounded back to the rear.

333
00:18:56,594 --> 00:19:00,222
We'll treat them there
together with Orga and Ururu.

334
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,974
Why won't we be going to the front lines?

335
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,686
There's no point. There won't be many
wounded people at the start of battle.

336
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,606
The front lines will be chaotic.
We'll be sitting ducks.

337
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,398
You have a point...

338
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:15,196
One more thing about
being on the front lines.

339
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,115
Don't save the wrong people.

340
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,619
Like not healing the enemy?

341
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,537
Not that, you idiot.

342
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,999
Don't go healing everyone you see.

343
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:33,506
Let's say you see someone who's
still fighting despite being injured.

344
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,966
What's gonna happen
if you try to heal him?

345
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,554
I'll just be getting in his way.

346
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,639
That's right.

347
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,059
In battle, our troops will be
mixed with the enemy's.

348
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,604
Use your judgment to decide
who to heal at a moment's notice.

349
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,523
Understood!

350
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,487
What's this?

351
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,572
Look inside.

352
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,241
Okay.

353
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,421
The Rescue Squad uniform.

354
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:16,590
It's made to help one
stand out on the battlefield.

355
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:17,800
Right...

356
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,010
It's yours, wear it!

357
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:23,640
Right away!

358
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,438
Gotta say, it fits you well.

359
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:33,107
It was worth building up
all that muscle, huh?

360
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,401
Y-you think?

361
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:38,362
I certainly wouldn't have
looked good in it before--

362
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,075
Listen here, Usato.

363
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,703
Healers aren't immortal.

364
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,997
Once you die, it's game over.

365
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,707
Remember this!

366
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:53,002
The one thing to never do
on the battlefield...

367
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:57,173
is to take your life for granted.

368
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,259
I... know that already.

369
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,386
It's not like I want to die.

370
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,888
Are you an idiot?

371
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:04,513
Ow!

372
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,518
Talk is cheap.

373
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:13,063
I know people who said
that crap and died anyway...

374
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:16,233
and I know an idiot who's
just dying with regret.

375
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,446
Don't underestimate
the value of your life.

376
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:23,574
Being part of the Rescue Squad means
that you have to save yourself, too.

377
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:27,119
Give me any of that
self-sacrificing crap...

378
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,498
and I'll kill you before the enemy does.

379
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:35,795
Very well.

380
00:21:35,796 --> 00:21:39,215
I will save everyone, including myself.

381
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,759
Can you do that?

382
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:44,887
You're the one who told
me to speak my ideals.

383
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:52,228
Don't forget what you just said.

384
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:54,980
Roger!

385
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:56,899
Thank you, Captain!

386
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:08,452
<i>It doesn't matter if that was
a vision of the future or not.</i>

387
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,121
<i>What I have to do is clear.</i>

388
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,293
<i>Not let Kazuki or Senpai die.</i>

389
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,795
<i>No matter what!</i>

390
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:25,723
<i>The beginning was sudden and silent.</i>

391
00:22:25,723 --> 00:22:33,478
<i>Then, everything before
me began to change.</i>

392
00:22:45,368 --> 00:22:51,249
<i>Even the stones lying at my feet</i>

393
00:22:51,249 --> 00:22:57,463
<i>seem to shine a little brighter.</i>

394
00:22:57,463 --> 00:23:06,973
<i>That's because you're reflected in them.</i>

395
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:12,353
<i>Like a young leaf that's just sprouted,</i>

396
00:23:12,353 --> 00:23:18,315
<i>you're brimming with a translucent light.</i>

397
00:23:19,777 --> 00:23:24,824
<i>Let the wind blow you onward.</i>

398
00:23:24,824 --> 00:23:30,496
<i>If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.</i>

399
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:36,586
<i>Even if you're not special,
you can be anything.</i>

400
00:23:36,586 --> 00:23:49,223
<i>Let me believe in the strength
that's awakened in your heart.</i>
