<i>When I awoke, I thought
it was all a dream.</i>

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,022
<i>But I really</i> am <i>in another world.</i>

3
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,777
Oh, newbie! Yer awake?

4
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:27,611
Ya got visitors.

5
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:31,740
Usato! I'm glad you're all right.

6
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:33,909
When we heard that you
were forcibly abducted,

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,702
we got worried!

8
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:39,164
Sorry to have worried you guys.

9
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:40,832
As you can see, I'm still ali...

10
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:50,050
Starting today, I'm supposed
to undergo "hellish training."

11
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,969
I might not be alive tomorrow...

12
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:55,055
Hellish? That bad?

13
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,139
Seems like it.

14
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:59,643
But from how you're acting,
you're prepared to do it?

15
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:02,020
I suppose.

16
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,606
There's nothing better to do anyway.

17
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:08,569
This is a great chance to
do something useful.

18
00:01:10,129 --> 00:01:12,322
I'm impressed, Usato-kun.

19
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:16,577
We're going to start training
today, too! Let's all do our best!

20
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:18,412
Let's!

21
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:22,040
I wonder what cool stuff you guys
will be doing for hero training.

22
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:25,002
I mean, those outfits are awesome!

23
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:27,421
You think so?

24
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,300
Thank you, Usato!

25
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,468
I've finally made up my mind.

26
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,056
Senpai, I'm going to do
my best in this world, too.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,767
That's great! So will I.

28
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,687
- Look at what I got.
<i>- Kazuki's got it tough, too.</i>

29
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,188
- Wow, that's amazing!
<i>- Kazuki's got it tough, too.</i>

30
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:48,150
<i>First he's taken to a new world.</i>

31
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:49,943
<i>Next, he's told he's a hero.</i>

32
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,195
<i>Even Inukami-senpai's...</i>

33
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,614
<i>Actually, I think she's doing just fine.</i>

34
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,953
<i>Whatever the case, I'd like to
be able to help them some day.</i>

35
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,168
Are the heroes gone?

36
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,130
Were you able to have a
nice long chat with them?

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,800
Yes, Rose-san! Thank you
very much for your concern!

38
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,385
This isn't a prison.

39
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,512
You're free to meet with your friends.

40
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,183
When you're not training, that is.

41
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:22,934
Yes, ma'am!

42
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,931
Take this.

43
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,772
It's a diary.

44
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:31,568
Write down your training regimen,
your experiences, anything you want.

45
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,944
I'm sure it'll come in handy.

46
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,614
We'll start after breakfast.

47
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:41,995
...and so, my hellish training begins.

<i>Day One.</i>

69
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,804
<i>What Tong and the others referred to as
"hellish training" was surprisingly easy.</i>

70
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:26,349
Well? Do you feel anything?

71
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:31,897
I do... something warm and
fuzzy right around here.

72
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:33,774
What you're feeling is magic.

73
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:38,361
Next, you'll need to learn how
to project it out of your body.

74
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:41,156
Out of my body?

75
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,699
You'll see what I mean.

76
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,993
For now, just get a hang of this feeling.

77
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:47,496
Read.

78
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,583
H-how am I going to read something
written in this world's language?

79
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,168
Just open it already.

80
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,759
I understand it! I can read it!

81
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,345
Those brought here by the Hero Summon

82
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,704
have a translation spell
automatically cast on them.

83
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:09,601
<i>Why didn't you tell
me that earlier?!</i>

84
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,145
This is the Llinger Kingdom.

85
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:16,441
And here is where the demons live.

86
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,306
It's right next door.

87
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:19,267
Indeed.

88
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:22,864
This means we're their first target.

89
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:25,158
Make sure you read that book.

90
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:30,455
It tells you all you'll need to know about
this world's nations, races, and demons.

91
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,438
Got it.

92
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,172
<i>This "training" is simple
enough, even for me!</i>

93
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,219
<i>Day Two. I ran a bunch.</i>

94
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,559
This <i>is magic training?</i>

95
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,435
<i>This is</i> not <i>what I had in mind.</i>

96
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,399
<i>Day Three.</i>

97
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,735
<i>I was made to run until my entire
body gave out from muscle soreness.</i>

98
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:08,493
Who the hell gave you permission to rest?

99
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,288
I can't run anymore! My legs are done for!

100
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,584
That hurts! Moving around like
this makes it hurt even more!

101
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,460
<i>Wait.</i>

102
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,421
<i>It</i> doesn't <i>hurt?</i>

103
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,409
I healed your muscle soreness with magic.

104
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,302
You can do that?

105
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:28,054
Get running. You piece of trash.

106
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,056
Trash?

107
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,726
I'm going to die! She's gonna kill me!

108
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,521
Run like your life depends on it!
I'll heal you if you die.

109
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,106
<i>You're out of your mind!</i>

110
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,483
<i>...is what I'd like to say.</i>

111
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,569
<i>All right. I'll just vent in my diary!</i>

112
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,363
<i>Day Four.</i>

113
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,365
<i>Today, I trained with the
other squad members.</i>

114
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,995
On yer left, Usato!

115
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,248
Ya gotta long way to go, Usato!

116
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,417
Struggle with all ya got, Usato!

117
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:59,920
Yer legs are wobblin' like jelly, Usato!

118
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,714
Yer not gonna get any
lunch at that rate, Usato!

119
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,551
It looks like we have a
maggot who's falling behind!

120
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,721
<i>I want to talk back so bad!</i>

121
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:12,014
<i>I'll vent in my diary again!</i>

122
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,100
<i>Day Five.</i>

123
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,894
<i>Again, I ran and ran.</i>

124
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:22,317
<i>Day Six. I ran.</i>

125
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:25,403
Maggot! You're slowing down!

126
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,118
<i>You cold, heartless savage!</i>

127
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,163
<i>Into the diary you go!</i>

128
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,541
What's this?

129
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,878
The light of healing magic?

130
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:45,799
Why now? What's the point?

131
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,924
A force unlike anything I've ever
felt has directly impacted my butt!

132
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,184
<i>Day Seven.</i>

133
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,187
<i>Yet again, I was forced
to run until I almost died.</i>

134
00:07:58,187 --> 00:07:59,354
<i>On top of that, she kicked me.</i>

135
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:03,817
The more you hate me,
the harsher I'll get.

136
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:08,238
<i>What? Did she read my diary?</i>

137
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:11,032
<i>No. There's no way
she can read Japanese.</i>

138
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:13,159
<i>Was it showing on my face?</i>

139
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,123
If you have time to sleep,
you have time to run!

140
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:22,043
<i>I'll call you a muscle-headed
demon gorilla in my diary!</i>

141
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:26,965
<i>Day Eght. I never learn, do I?</i>

142
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,300
That's a kick that can
cause serious damage!

143
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,387
<i>Day Nine.</i>

144
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:36,016
<i>Remember when I said I
didn't want healing magic?</i>

145
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,353
I'm gonna die! My butt's gonna fall off!

146
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,658
Huh? It doesn't hurt?

147
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,444
Not just my butt, my
entire body's pain-free!

148
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,739
<i>This</i> is healing magic!

149
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,074
<i>I don't want healing magic.</i>

150
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:56,596
<i>I</i> need <i>healing magic.</i>

151
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,418
<i>Day 10.</i>

152
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,963
<i>Ever since I learned how
to output healing magic,</i>

153
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:09,340
<i>I could run without ever getting tired.</i>

154
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,427
<i>But still I doubted.</i>

155
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:18,767
<i>Will I ever be of use to Kazuki
or Inukami-senpai just by running?</i>

156
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:24,390
<i>If Rose-san ever heard me say this,
she'd probably kick my butt.</i>

157
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,649
Usato! Another 30 laps!

158
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,611
And pick up the pace!

159
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,781
<i>No more "Rose-san" for her!</i>

160
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,949
<i>"Rose" is all she deserves!</i>

161
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:38,953
<i>I'm gonna see this training through.</i>

162
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,457
<i>Then, I'm gonna show her who's boss!</i>

163
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,793
<i>Day 11.</i>

164
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:48,421
<i>Something new has been
added to my training regimen.</i>

165
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:53,343
817, 818...

166
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,139
819, 820, 821...

167
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,310
Hey, Usato. Do you know why we need
to go so far to strengthen your body?

168
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:07,774
That's because... on the battlefield,
you need to be able to run from the enemy.

169
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,609
<i>Battlefield?</i>

170
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,071
And you'll need to save
your fallen comrades.

171
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:16,074
The faster you can run, the faster
you'll be able to save them.

172
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,328
The faster I run,
the faster I can save them?

173
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,122
Keep moving.

174
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,122
R-right...

175
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:28,044
<i>I got through today's training
without being yelled at.</i>

176
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:31,964
<i>I should be happy...
but it frankly scared me.</i>

177
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,800
<i>Day 12.</i>

178
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:37,262
<i>After running all morning,
I do pushups until sunset.</i>

179
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,391
<i>Is it just me? Or does
my body feel lighter?</i>

180
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,467
<i>Day 13.</i>

181
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:48,001
<i>Rose seems to have noticed.
So, she added weights.</i>

182
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,100
<i>It's... really heavy.</i>

183
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,322
<i>Day 14. My lunch disappeared.</i>

184
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,869
Does anyone know what
happened to my lunch?

185
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:04,414
I left it right there. It disappeared
when I went to get my water.

186
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,376
Oh, that? It was delish!

187
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,296
Wait, it was yers?

188
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:15,940
I thought it was someone's
leftovers.

189
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:17,719
My bad, my bad.

190
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,762
Cut the crap!

191
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,140
Chill out, dude.

192
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,017
You thieving bastard!

193
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,214
Fightin's banned in the Rescue Squad.

194
00:11:28,215 --> 00:11:29,314
Like I give a damn!

195
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,283
Come back here!

196
00:11:32,284 --> 00:11:34,152
Just one! Just one punch!

197
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,272
<i>Oh, yeah. I got used to
the weights in no time.</i>

198
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:40,283
<i>For all my complaining,
I'm doing just fine.</i>

199
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,705
<i>Wait. Am I being brainwashed?</i>

200
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:52,045
<i>A week later, Kazuki and
Inukami-senpai paid me a visit.</i>

201
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,053
Usato's over there.

202
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,638
Thank you.

203
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,478
Wait, <i>that's</i> Usato?

204
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,909
You're slowing down.
What are you, a caterpillar?

205
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,828
Don't you dare quit! This is nothing!

206
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,749
Who's quitting?

207
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,460
Quit the chit-chat.

208
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,214
Did you say something?

209
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,677
You're so light, I couldn't help myself.

210
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:45,223
Really?! How kind of you.

211
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,352
But if you really feel that way...

212
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:05,827
I see that you're slowly
becoming my type of man.

213
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,748
At this rate, I'll be able to take you
with me sooner than I thought.

214
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,704
Y-you're kidding.

215
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:14,877
<i>That's</i> Usato?

216
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,548
What splendid muscles!

217
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:21,009
Indeed, what cruel train...

218
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,058
What the hell are you doing?

219
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:32,895
I said, what are you doing?

220
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,441
Trying to break a hopeful
young man's spirit?!

221
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,153
Release me, old man Siglis.

222
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,197
You have your chivalry,

223
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,825
I have my methods.

224
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:50,246
Usato will become my right-hand man.

225
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,707
I can't afford to go any easier on him.

226
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,335
Right-hand man?

227
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,754
<i>Right-hand man?</i>

228
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,590
He's quite the catch.

229
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,967
I love how he hates losing.

230
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,553
I love how he never gives up even more.

231
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:10,224
The fact that he can keep up
with my training seals the deal.

232
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,023
...is it just me, or is he
doing more harm than good?

233
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,360
Usato, take a break.
We're just in time for lunch.

234
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,487
I bet you have some catching
up to do with the heroes.

235
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,113
O-okay.

236
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:31,204
Suzune-sama, Kazuki-sama.
I leave Celia-sama in your care.

237
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,498
I'd like to have a word with her.

238
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,708
U-understood.

239
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,043
Let's go, Usato.

240
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,043
A-alright.

241
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,923
There is something wrong with you.

242
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:44,467
The king has ordered
your reenlistment,

243
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,177
but I remain opposed!

244
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:48,554
It was never going to happen anyway.

245
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,597
My right eye's busted.

246
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:51,891
Enough nonsense!

247
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,437
T-that guy was Llinger
Kingdom's army commander?

248
00:14:56,437 --> 00:15:00,233
Yup. The kingdom's
strongest knight, Siglis-san.

249
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,944
He's currently teaching
us how to sword fight.

250
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,239
I see. That's amazing!

251
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,074
By the way, who might this girl be?

252
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:14,372
My apologies. My name
is Celia Vulgast Llinger.

253
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,040
Llinger?

254
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,376
W-wait, you don't mean...

255
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,544
as in King Llinger?

256
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,962
Indeed. I am his daughter.

257
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,798
Y-you're the p-princess?!

258
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,385
P-pardon my rudeness, your
Royal Princessness! Ma'am!

259
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,096
Please, be at ease.

260
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,057
A-are you sure?

261
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,143
Yes! That would be most delightful.

262
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,730
You reacted exactly
like Usato did, didn't you?

263
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,025
Q-quit it, Inukami-senpai!

264
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,781
I brought this to share with everyone.

265
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:50,992
I hope it will be to your liking.

266
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,540
This is delicious!

267
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,293
Why, thank you!

268
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:06,716
Usato, is your training always
as bad as it was just now?

269
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:12,648
Nah, I had it easy today.
What about you guys?

270
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:13,443
Us?

271
00:16:13,444 --> 00:16:15,433
Well, let's see...

272
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:16,434
Um...

273
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:21,731
The training is tough, but both
Siglis, who teaches us sword fighting,

274
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,275
and Welcie, who teaches us magic,

275
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:29,071
are sure to take our physical and
mental conditions into consideration.

276
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:32,408
I see. That's normal, I guess.

277
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,702
Rose-san's just abnormal.

278
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,245
I'm sorry, Usato.

279
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,498
Why're you apologizing?

280
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,457
I'll have another slice!

281
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,253
Hey, Usato...

282
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,006
Mind if I take a peek, Usato-kun?

283
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,424
S-senpai?

284
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,345
I knew it! What awe-inspiring muscles!

285
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,890
Usato-kun, mind if I cop a feel?

286
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,102
S-senpai, settle down! There, there!

287
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,271
Weren't you about to
say something, Kazuki?

288
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,433
T-that's right.

289
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:09,195
I was wondering if you
were having a tough time...

290
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:14,325
I am.

291
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,953
I kept wanting to run away at first.

292
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,829
What about now?

293
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,292
Rose-san scares me, but I don't
feel like running away anymore.

294
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:27,004
I'm actually starting to
find training enjoyable.

295
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:31,300
On top of that, life
here's not all that bad.

296
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,971
I'm impressed.

297
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,265
You've already found where you belong.

298
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:41,310
It's nothing to be impressed with.
I'm just being stubborn.

299
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,566
You guys are going to
be fighting as heroes.

300
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,193
I've got to be able to do something.

301
00:17:52,883 --> 00:17:57,054
In that case, come save me
when I'm in a pinch, okay?

302
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:02,498
I-if you ask me, I think it's too late
to start acting like a normal girl...

303
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:07,044
I <i>am</i> a normal girl.
What do you take me for?

304
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:11,465
I concur. Suzune-sama is hardly what
one would refer to as a "normal girl."

305
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,718
N-not you, too, Celia-san!

306
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,680
There ya are, Usato!

307
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:22,393
Ain't I nice? I brought yer lunch!

308
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,606
What's with the condescending attitude?

309
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:33,446
You dare bring me my lunch with that
smile on your face, you blockhead?

310
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:38,659
You asshole... bringin' up shit
that's long past. Yer bein' a kid!

311
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,371
And who was it who
ate that kid's food, huh?

312
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,332
You've got no right!

313
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,325
Bring it on!

314
00:18:46,327 --> 00:18:49,379
Big Sis ain't here today.
Get ready for a beatin'!

315
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,716
Give it your best shot!

316
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:56,052
You shitty brat!

317
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,931
S-should we intervene?

318
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,852
It's okay, Celia-san.

319
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,232
That's probably how it's like
for Usato every day.

320
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:15,029
Indeed. He's living here
while staying true to himself.

321
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:18,240
He might be fitting in
even better than we are.

322
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,326
I can't sit still after all that!

323
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,454
I'm going back to the castle
to continue training.

324
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,208
Kazuki-sama, please wait for me!

325
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:38,052
<i>I believe there's a reason we
were all summoned here together.</i>

326
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:42,973
<i>Let's all do our best, Usato-kun.</i>

327
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,482
<i>I'm glad I was able to see
Kazuki and Inukami-senpai.</i>

328
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:55,152
<i>Though, she kinda creeped me out a little.</i>

329
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,490
<i>But I guess she was right...</i>

330
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,493
<i>My body</i> has <i>changed.</i>

331
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,663
<i>I've gotten faster.</i>

332
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:09,542
<i>Wearing out my muscles
with intense training</i>

333
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:11,376
<i>and healing them with
magic over and over again.</i>

334
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,712
<i>This is the result.</i>

335
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,423
<i>But still...</i>

336
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,176
<i>The faster you can run, the faster
you'll be able to save them.</i>

337
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:23,347
<i>Run to save those on the battlefield.</i>

338
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,599
<i>Will I be able to do that?</i>

339
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:30,855
<i>Is my spirit as strong as my body?</i>

340
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,444
Usato, we're heading out today.

341
00:20:36,446 --> 00:20:37,236
Okay.

342
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,406
Outside?

343
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,533
It's finally time.

344
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,915
R-Rose-san! What brings you here today?

345
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,876
Good seeing you, Thomas.

346
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,628
Gonna show one of my guys the outside.

347
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,464
I-I'll open the gates at once!

348
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,091
That's Rose for you.

349
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,051
Scaring everyone with
her presence alone.

350
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,929
<i>What's outside, anyway?</i>

351
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:17,151
Where are we going, Rose-san?

352
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,652
Can it and follow me.

353
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,199
Here we are.

354
00:21:23,905 --> 00:21:27,327
This forest is also known
as the Darkness of Llinger.

355
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:29,955
It's famous for teeming with monsters.

356
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:34,335
You're not coming home until
you kill a Grand Grizzly.

357
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:35,099
What?!

358
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:37,838
W-wait a minute! A Grand Grizzly?!

359
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:40,883
Isn't that the bear monster a Blue Grizzly
becomes after living for a hundred years?!

360
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:45,596
According to the book, the Blue Grizzly
is already fearsome enough as it is!

361
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:49,225
As you are now, a Grand Grizzly
is no match for you. Got it?

362
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,434
No, I do not!

363
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,979
I've only been running! You
never even taught me how to fight!

364
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,773
You're pissing me off.

365
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,442
N-no! Please stop! Don't pick me up!

366
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,863
Don't throw me, either!

367
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:15,751
<i>The beginning was sudden and silent.</i>

368
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:23,425
<i>Then, everything before
me began to change.</i>

369
00:22:35,396 --> 00:22:41,277
<i>Even the stones lying at my feet</i>

370
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:47,491
<i>seem to shine a little brighter.</i>

371
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:57,001
<i>That's because you're reflected in them.</i>

372
00:22:57,001 --> 00:23:02,381
<i>Like a young leaf that's just sprouted,</i>

373
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:08,262
<i>you're brimming with a translucent light.</i>

374
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:14,852
<i>Let the wind blow you onward.</i>

375
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:20,524
<i>If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.</i>

376
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:26,614
<i>Even if you're not special,
you can be anything.</i>

377
00:23:26,616 --> 00:23:39,253
<i>Let me believe in the strength
that's awakened in your heart.</i>
