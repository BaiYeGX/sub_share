1
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,788
<i>It's finally the day of the battle.</i>

2
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:39,998
Oh, Usato-kun!

3
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,833
You're wearing matching
outfits with Rose-san!

4
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,585
Inukami-senpai!

5
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:46,380
What's up? You're up early.

6
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,466
Just going on one of
those morning walks.

7
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,093
More importantly...

8
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,763
what do you think of this armor?

9
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,474
I'm not sure what you want me to say...

10
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,017
It's pretty, isn't it?

11
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:01,270
But that's not all there is to it!

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,480
You wanna know more, don't you?

13
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,982
Of course, you do!

14
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:05,899
Sure...

15
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:11,697
This armor boosts my lightning magic!

16
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,284
It also doesn't hinder my movement!

17
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,911
Check out the joints on this thing!

18
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,163
You sure are happy...

19
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:24,334
So, you prefer armor over cute stuff...?

20
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,711
Not at all!

21
00:01:25,712 --> 00:01:30,507
Back home, I used to
cultivate cactuses to relax.

22
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:34,595
I don't know whether
I'd call cactuses cute...

23
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:38,849
Then, why don't you become
my source of comfort?

24
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:40,976
What's with that leap in logic?

25
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:42,686
I've already lost you!

26
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,605
You need to be true
to yourself, Usato-kun!

27
00:01:44,606 --> 00:01:46,690
I know the truth!

28
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:48,483
That's just you hiding your feelings.

29
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,277
In other words, your "tsun"!

30
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,779
S-Senapi, please calm down!

31
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,949
Where there's a "tsun,"
there's always a "dere"!

32
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,494
I want to create a situation
where you're all "dere"!

33
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,413
Come! Let's get along!

34
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:03,332
S-stop!

35
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:05,751
Humans are creatures of communication!

36
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:07,294
Let's use our words!

37
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:10,672
There are times when actions
speak louder than words!

38
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,466
This is one of those times!

39
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,886
K-Kazuki! Save me!

40
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,263
Senpai, what are you doing?!

41
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,514
He really came?!

42
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,725
Don't stop me, Kazuki-kun!

43
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:25,020
Siglis-san is calling for us, let's go!

44
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,148
I'll go once I make Usato-kun mine!

45
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,400
Get her out of here right now, Kazuki!

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,652
You got it, Usato!

47
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,321
I'll be back, Usato-kun!

48
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,990
I'll have you comfort me yet!

49
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,743
See ya, Usato!

50
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,995
Thanks, Kazuki!

51
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,229
(The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic)

52
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:10,888
<i>The walls that tower over you</i>

53
00:03:13,015 --> 00:03:15,560
<i>are just so tall and thick.</i>

54
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:20,022
<i>They're not there to overwhelm you.</i>

55
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:24,485
<i>They're there for you to overcome.</i>

56
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:28,865
<i>That's what I believe.</i>

57
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:30,950
<i>For thousands of nights</i>

58
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,327
<i>and tens of thousands of mornings,</i>

59
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:35,955
<i>I can keep trying</i>

60
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:37,749
<i>without losing my way.</i>

61
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:39,792
<i>As long as I can arrive</i>

62
00:03:39,792 --> 00:03:42,128
<i>at the final chapter,</i>

63
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:45,965
<i>it's okay even if</i>

64
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:48,217
<i>I'm scarred.</i>

65
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:50,845
<i>Stand! Up! Again!</i>

66
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:52,638
<i>Over and over!</i>

67
00:03:52,638 --> 00:03:55,308
<i>Don't! Look! Back!</i>

68
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:58,561
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

69
00:03:59,728 --> 00:04:01,730
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

70
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,053
According to our scouts,

71
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:26,266
it will be another half hour before
the Demon Lord's Army arrives.

72
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,769
When they do, we will
launch a preemptive strike...

73
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,021
with a barrage of magic.

74
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:35,609
After that, you two will engage the enemy.

75
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,196
Together with the other knights, you will
carve open a path to the enemy general.

76
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,490
And, if possible...

77
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:43,867
take that general down!

78
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:45,535
Understood.

79
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:49,873
We <i>will</i> bring Lloyd-sama good news back!

80
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:50,707
Roger!

81
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,087
Don't push yourself too hard, Kazuki-kun.

82
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,839
I'll be fine.

83
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,841
You don't have to worry about me.

84
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,594
What about you, Senpai?

85
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,970
Aren't <i>you</i> worried?

86
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,433
Enough to distract yourself with Usato?

87
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,313
You're sharp when
it comes to others, huh?

88
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,982
I <i>am</i> worried.

89
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:20,278
But to tell you the truth,
I feel kind of empowered.

90
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:26,034
That's way different from
back in our old world.

91
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:30,121
Yup. That old me is gone.

92
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,709
But Usato-kun accepts me for who I am now.

93
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,885
I didn't know that! Tell me more!

94
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,682
Not now. I'll tell you
if we make it back safe.

95
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,601
<i>If</i> we make it, huh?

96
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:56,022
We've got to make it back now.

97
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,613
Senpai.

98
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,075
I feel it, too.

99
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,493
They're here.

100
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,418
Ready your magic!

101
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,254
We're making the first move.

102
00:06:19,255 --> 00:06:20,046
You ready?

103
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,090
Of course!

104
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:24,384
We've got no choice, after all!

105
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,182
Fire!

106
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,814
All right!

107
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:42,903
That was...

108
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,321
an illusion?!

109
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:46,823
Where is the real army?

110
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,575
Illusion magic.

111
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,369
They're to the southwest!

112
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,373
Let's go, Kazuki-kun!

113
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,166
Right!

114
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,295
Tong.

115
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,755
Alec.

116
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,214
Mill.

117
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:04,674
Gomul.

118
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,134
Gurd.

119
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,845
You guys head out onto the battlefield.

120
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,389
Bring anyone you find
who's injured back here.

121
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,057
Yes, ma'am!

122
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,141
Go!

123
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,310
And make sure to make it back alive!

124
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,686
Roger!

125
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,272
Orga, Ururu.

126
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,900
The two of you will be
stationed in this tent.

127
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:24,194
Aruku will act as your guard.

128
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,323
But, if anything happens,
make a run for it.

129
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,449
Got it!

130
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,204
You and I will head out onto
the battlefield after some time.

131
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:36,456
In the meantime, we'll
heal the wounded here.

132
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,457
Understood.

133
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,876
Everyone, to your stations!

134
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,005
Senpai and Kazuki...

135
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,340
I wonder if they'll be fine.

136
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,092
Worried about your friends?

137
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,551
O-of course.

138
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:52,305
But you'll be heading out as well.

139
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,515
You need to take care, too.

140
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,516
Right.

141
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,476
Here they come!

142
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:57,852
Already?!

143
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,855
This is war. They'll keep coming.

144
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,691
Get to healing, now!

145
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,942
R-right away!

146
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,658
This is bad!

147
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,457
I'm sorry, I'll heal you right away!

148
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,796
A... snake...

149
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,634
A big snake... blew me away.

150
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,178
<i>Could it be...</i>

151
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,014
<i>related to that one?</i>

152
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,309
<i>Gotta focus on healing first!</i>

153
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,439
Damn demons!

154
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,898
I can't believe they have a giant snake!

155
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,735
Don't let your guard down! It's venomous!

156
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,361
Then, what can we--

157
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,282
Guess that's all humans are capable of.

158
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,618
I didn't even need to come...

159
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,043
I got him!

160
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,473
B-but how?

161
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,226
Humans really <i>are</i> weak...

162
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,352
It's sad, really...

163
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,980
What... happened?

164
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,107
What... are you?

165
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,611
I wonder...

166
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,987
What <i>am</i> I?

167
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:36,950
I have to tell them!

168
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,537
Tell them about this...!

169
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,249
You're tenacious, I grant you that.

170
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,709
But I grow tired of you.

171
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,710
So, die.

172
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,050
What?

173
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,594
That's my special stinky water!

174
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,472
What was that about?

175
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:01,768
There are some troublesome
pests on the human side.

176
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,728
The Kidnappers.

177
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:05,605
I see!

178
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,649
So, those are the Kidnappers!

179
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,113
Well played, humans!

180
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,824
Keep making this fun for me!

181
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,623
What's going on over there?

182
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,877
This one's serious! Best treat him quick!

183
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,295
Put him over here!

184
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,132
It's about time.

185
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,510
Usato...

186
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,387
you ready?

187
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,181
Of course.

188
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:44,185
You've trained me to
be your right-hand man.

189
00:10:44,687 --> 00:10:45,603
I see.

190
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:47,355
Guess I won't have to worry.

191
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:50,066
You were worried?

192
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,943
That's a surprise.

193
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,945
You don't know when to shut up.

194
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,823
Orga, Ururu, I leave
this place to you guys.

195
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,994
Roger! Go heal up a storm!

196
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,662
Stay safe, all right?

197
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:03,621
You got it!

198
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,622
Here we go!

199
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,668
Take care of those two.

200
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,586
Of course.

201
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:11,045
You bet I will.

202
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,341
Let's go.

203
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,808
I heard something concerning from Alec.

204
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:24,434
Yeah?

205
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,811
There's an enemy in black armor.

206
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,189
According to a knight
who got taken down by him,

207
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:31,190
he uses a peculiar kind of magic.

208
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,066
Be careful.

209
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,986
Black armor?

210
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,831
What's up?

211
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:47,874
N-nothing.

212
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,794
Here's one final piece of advice for you.

213
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,673
You can't kill anyone, can you?

214
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,886
My role is... to save lives.

215
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,845
You have to be a real idiot

216
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:06,059
to say that in the face of death.

217
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:12,148
I've got a special technique
for idiots like you.

218
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,819
Listen up because I'm only
going to say this once.

219
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,949
If you face an enemy you
have to defeat no matter what...

220
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,872
That really <i>is</i> the
best technique ever.

221
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:30,959
Did you think that up especially for me?

222
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,085
Not on your life.

223
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,003
Thank you.

224
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:35,964
No problem.

225
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,175
You go right, I go left.

226
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,095
Yes, Captain!

227
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,906
<i>This is the battlefield.</i>

228
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,954
Die!

229
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,837
You're one of those healers, huh?

230
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,555
Come on, come on!

231
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,682
Get outta my way!!!

232
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,103
She flew!

233
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,859
Y-you are?

234
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,820
I healed you while I was carrying you.

235
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:42,530
Take a little rest,

236
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,616
and if you're still not feeling well,
please withdraw from the front lines.

237
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,333
Thank you very much, Madam Hero!

238
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:56,252
We've managed to clear out
most of the surrounding enemies.

239
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:59,630
Commander, have anyone
injured withdraw at once!

240
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:01,883
I'm going ahead!

241
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:02,883
Yes, ma'am!

242
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,809
Senpai, are you all right?

243
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,520
Of course!

244
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,814
Their base is still quite a way away.

245
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,566
We don't have time to dally!

246
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:23,070
I heard they have a rather
pesky snake monster.

247
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:23,780
Yeah...

248
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,992
But we have to clear a path
to the enemy general.

249
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,120
I know.

250
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,123
Let's do our job and kill that snake, too.

251
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's.

252
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,627
Come on, everyone!

253
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,891
I found you!

254
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,519
What... is that?

255
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:56,771
I don't know,

256
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:00,650
but that guy's unlike any of
the soldiers we fought before!

257
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,319
Stay back, everyone!

258
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,114
Stop! Come back!

259
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,703
Take this!

260
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,792
Why is he not resisting?

261
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,671
He... doesn't feel pain?

262
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,092
You're in the way...

263
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:26,801
pests.

264
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,393
Fall back at once! Quickly!

265
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,447
What... did you do?!

266
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,239
Don't!

267
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,577
Oh, light magic?!

268
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:54,078
That's a first for me!

269
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,622
Why'd you stop me, Senpai?!

270
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,001
You mustn’t land a direct hit on him.

271
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,044
If I'm correct, his magic is...

272
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,463
Reflect.

273
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,508
Kazuki-kun!

274
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,637
What happened?

275
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,305
<i>Under his armor?</i>

276
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,766
Kazuki-kun, are you okay?

277
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,311
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

278
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,229
But...

279
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:23,316
thanks to your rashness...

280
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,901
I've figured it out.

281
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,527
His magic.

282
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:30,138
It reflects all damage dealt to his armor

283
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:31,991
right back onto his opponents.

284
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,411
Oh? You're a clever one.

285
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,039
No one's figured it out so quickly before.

286
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,958
Don't run on me now.

287
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,045
You guys seem strong for humans.

288
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:48,341
Struggle, struggle, and struggle
and <i>then</i> die!

289
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:02,355
<i>Damn it! What's this?</i>

290
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,066
<i>Healing magic doesn't work on it.</i>

291
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,361
<i>Did something happen to Senpai and Kazuki?</i>

292
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,696
Die!

293
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,538
You're mine!

294
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,293
Are you all right?

295
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,047
You're the guy I healed just now!

296
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,095
Yeah, thanks for that!

297
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,389
No, it's nothing.

298
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,683
Er, do you know where Inu...

299
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,059
I mean...

300
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,353
do you know where the Heroes are?

301
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,522
The Heroes?

302
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,899
They're right in the
middle of the front lines.

303
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,278
Thank you very much.

304
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:52,989
Take care!

305
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,574
<i>Please...</i>

306
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,908
<i>still be alive!</i>

307
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,659
That's right.

308
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:03,916
You guys take on those weaklings.

309
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,795
Kazuki-kun, let's take
out the Black Knight

310
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,505
while the others are being distracted.

311
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:10,840
But how?

312
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:15,803
If he can reflect any attack,
there's nothing we can do.

313
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,888
It might be dangerous,

314
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,223
but there's something I want to try.

315
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:21,892
Oh?

316
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,103
What do you guys have in mind?

317
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,608
Senpai, it's way too dangerous!

318
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,734
You scared?

319
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:32,528
At worst, we have Usato to heal us!

320
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:39,035
I'm already used to your
foolhardiness from back home.

321
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,115
You ready?

322
00:18:43,116 --> 00:18:44,999
Then, let's dance!

323
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,209
Let's go, Kazuki-kun!

324
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:47,793
You got it!

325
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,635
<i>We've obstructed his vision!</i>

326
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,315
Did that work?

327
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,567
Reflect.

328
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:24,121
<i>I had hoped he wouldn't be able
to reflect attacks he couldn't see.</i>

329
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,206
<i>I was hoping for too much.</i>

330
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,793
<i>The attack on his back...</i>

331
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:30,711
<i>wasn't reflected!</i>

332
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:36,550
Kazuki-kun, let's try that one more time!

333
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,009
Wha?

334
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,013
Very well!

335
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:45,434
Show me something more
interesting this time, okay?

336
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,328
<i>I know exactly...</i>

337
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,914
<i>what you have in mind.</i>

338
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,506
<i>That's</i> all you've got?

339
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,968
Trying to blind me again? How boring.

340
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,650
<i>The attack isn't being reflected.</i>

341
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,193
<i>As I suspected.</i>

342
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:38,614
<i>He can't reflect attacks
he can't perceive.</i>

343
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,825
<i>And now that he can't speak...</i>

344
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,995
Your attack should work now, Kazuki-kun!

345
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,084
Just kidding!

346
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:56,756
Reflect.

347
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:13,898
K-Kazuki...-kun.

348
00:21:14,989 --> 00:21:19,202
Attacks he can't perceive
aren't reflected right away.

349
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:24,200
So, all we need to do is to make him
unable to say "reflect" with an attack.

350
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,451
Is that what you thought?

351
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:31,081
It has nothing to do with
my vision or my perception.

352
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,625
It's not automatic.

353
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,752
<i>I</i> decide what attacks to reflect.

354
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:39,465
I purposely didn't reflect
the attack on my back.

355
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,510
I don't even need to say
"reflect" for it to work.

356
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,931
No one has ever injured me...

357
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,724
and no one ever will.

358
00:22:04,404 --> 00:22:06,573
<i>Usato...-kun.</i>

359
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,036
<i>I'm... sorry.</i>

360
00:22:10,518 --> 00:22:15,731
<i>The beginning was sudden and silent.</i>

361
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:23,486
<i>Then, everything before
me began to change.</i>

362
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:41,257
<i>Even the stones lying at my feet</i>

363
00:22:41,257 --> 00:22:47,471
<i>seem to shine a little brighter.</i>

364
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:56,981
<i>That's because you're reflected in them.</i>

365
00:22:56,981 --> 00:23:02,361
<i>Like a young leaf that's just sprouted,</i>

366
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:08,323
<i>you're brimming with a translucent light.</i>

367
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:14,832
<i>Let the wind blow you onward.</i>

00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:20,504
<i>If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.</i>

00:23:20,504 --> 00:23:26,594
<i>Even if you're not special,
you can be anything.</i>

370
00:23:26,594 --> 00:23:39,231
<i>Let me believe in the strength
that's awakened in your heart.</i>
