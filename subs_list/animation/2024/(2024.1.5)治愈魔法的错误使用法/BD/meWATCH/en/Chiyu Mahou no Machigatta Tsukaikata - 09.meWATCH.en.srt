00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:04,046
These guys are tough!

2
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,006
They might be strong...

3
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,007
but...

4
00:00:07,549 --> 00:00:09,092
we're stronger!

5
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,771
Taste the might of Rose's personal unit!

6
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,992
<i>That sword is likely imbued with a curse.</i>

7
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:36,119
<i>I can't afford to be hit by that.</i>

8
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,090
Nero-sama!

9
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,390
Is that all?

10
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,811
I know that didn't do much.

11
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,354
Get up.

<i>Only towards the future.</i>

30
00:02:21,668 --> 00:02:23,670
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

(#9 The End and the Beginning)

32
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,917
Goodness.

33
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,836
Who would have thought that
a mere monster-hunting mission

34
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,255
would give us this much trouble.

35
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:56,218
Look at what's become
of the men I trained.

36
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,763
Rose.

37
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:02,599
Your men seem plenty skilled as well.

38
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,643
Where'd this come from?

39
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,520
I'm offering them my praise.

40
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:11,441
You guys are the toughest
opponents I've ever faced.

41
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,151
Why, thank you.

42
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,279
You humans have no more Heroes.

43
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,447
Come again?

44
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,410
There are no longer any humans
who wield exceptional power.

45
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,828
That's what I believed.

46
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,121
So what?

47
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:27,791
Did you guys think you could beat us
now that we no longer have Heroes?

48
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,376
Is that it?

49
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:33,088
If so, you take us too lightly.

50
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,214
Indeed I have.

51
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:36,425
But my mind has been changed.

52
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:41,721
You lot have become the greatest obstacle
in the way of achieving our ultimate goal.

53
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,306
Ultimate goal?

54
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,601
The era of demonkind living
in fear of humans is at an end.

55
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,687
Our king will rise again.

56
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,815
He is cruel, savage, and heartless.

57
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,401
But to us, he is merciful and benevolent.

58
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:57,987
He is an absolute being
who promised us victory!

59
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,114
Wha?!

60
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,282
That is why!

61
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,409
For him to bring us victory!

62
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,578
For the prosperity of all demonkind!

63
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,415
We have to kill you here and now!

64
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,042
Even at the cost of our own lives!

65
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,043
All right!

66
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,716
L-let me go!

67
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,426
This guy...

68
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,344
How does he still have the strength?!

69
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,223
We are the Demon Lord's swords.

70
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,184
Even if our bodies are broken...

71
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,227
We will drag our enemies down with us!

72
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,688
Stop it!

73
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,317
Glory to...

74
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:37,194
the Demon Lord!

75
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,032
Naruka!

76
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,083
You bastard!

77
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,127
B-but how?!

78
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,545
I knocked him out!

79
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,300
What's with these guys?

80
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,804
Don't they care about their own lives?

81
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,096
Damn it!

82
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,973
Everyone! Calm down!

83
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,101
Stop it! Release me!

84
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,529
<i>This is bad! I won't make it in time!</i>

85
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,991
To you, I must be a real <i>demon</i>.

86
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,577
I am compelling my men to kill themselves

87
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,289
and defiling the sanctity of our battle.

88
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,124
On top of that,

89
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,584
Out of the way!

90
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:39,047
I am distracting you
by putting your men in peril.

91
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,224
I can see your clumsy moves coming...

92
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:50,392
from a mile away!

93
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,185
This is just a scratch!

94
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:58,483
My crimson sword can dispel all magic.

95
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:01,444
It inflicts a temporary curse
on anything it cuts.

96
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:05,490
Healing magic won't work on that wound.

97
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,908
Captain!

98
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,744
Healing magic! Now!

99
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,508
You still want to fight with
your impaired vision?

100
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,971
There is no way you will be
able to fight to your fullest.

101
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,348
I'm going to put an end to this.

102
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,895
<i>Damn it. My depth perception.</i>

103
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:44,988
O... wl.

104
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,618
Cap... tain.

105
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,891
If you're fighting alongside us,

106
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,934
we'll be invincible!

107
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,394
If anything happens,

108
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,521
you can just heal us with your magic!

109
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,397
Yeah!

110
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,982
No need to worry about getting hurt!

111
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,484
We can go all out!

112
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,112
<i>They all believed in me.</i>

113
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,407
<i>Believed that I would save them.</i>

114
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,452
<i>Believed that they'd be safe with me.</i>

115
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,583
<i>Owl, why didn't you run?</i>

116
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,294
<i>You wouldn't have been cut down.</i>

117
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,714
<i>It's all because I was weak.</i>

118
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,134
<i>I put too much faith in my own abilities.</i>

119
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,012
The deaths of my men...

120
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,731
the deaths of your men...

121
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,892
I will never forget them.

122
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,605
Die here...

123
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,439
Rose.

124
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,406
Don't screw with me!

125
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,619
You'll never forget them?

126
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,082
Take this!

127
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,167
What do you know about them?

128
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,168
Huh?

129
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,504
What do you know?

130
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:25,964
You piece of shit...

131
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:26,881
who sacrifices...

132
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,591
his own men...

133
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,593
in a suicide attack?!

134
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,098
There's nothing more insulting...

135
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:38,768
than having someone like you
empathize with us!

136
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,567
Nothing!!!

137
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,623
I'll kill you.

138
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,585
I swear I'll kill you!

139
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:10,300
<i>Damn it. I'm so close...</i>

140
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,511
<i>I...</i> will <i>kill him!</i>

141
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,598
M-Master!

142
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,851
I'll get you down right now!

143
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:24,105
Amila, didn't I tell you to stay back?

144
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,816
I'm sorry, Master!

145
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,027
But, I just couldn't leave you!

146
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,612
<i>What's this?</i>

147
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,197
<i>What</i> is <i>this?!</i>

148
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,283
<i>He sacrificed his men...</i>

149
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,537
<i>but he is being saved
by one of them like I was?</i>

150
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,874
Stop right there!

151
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,101
What is this?

152
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,605
What the hell is this?!

153
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,984
Captain...

154
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:10,985
Owl!

155
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,910
Captain...

156
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,203
Don't speak!

157
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,454
I'm coming to heal you!

158
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,498
It's not going to work.

159
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,501
He got me pretty good.

160
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:32,090
...and this wound can't be healed, can it?

161
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,176
We won't know until we try!

162
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,598
It's... okay.

163
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,683
I don't...

164
00:10:41,684 --> 00:10:43,309
regret what I did.

165
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:46,312
It was an honor...

166
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,868
to have fought for you.

167
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,733
Don't give me that crap!

168
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,485
What are you saying?!

169
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,530
I'm sure everyone thought the same...

170
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,782
So, please...

171
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,494
stay the captain we love and admire...

172
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,620
forever and ever.

173
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,582
I am <i>not</i> going to let you die!

174
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,709
Not on my life!

175
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,794
That's...

176
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,129
my captain.

177
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,640
That's... who you are.

178
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,619
In the near future,

179
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,871
the king of demons will revive

180
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:48,791
and attempt to invade our kingdom.

181
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,421
The man I fought, Nero, claimed as such.

182
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:58,801
Their monster hunting probably
has something to do with it.

183
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,346
Duly noted.

184
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,682
That ends my report.

185
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:07,185
If I may...

186
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,315
I have a request for you, Lloyd-sama.

187
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,191
Anything.

188
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,403
I would like to be
relieved of all my duties

189
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,406
as battalion commander and a knight.

190
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,995
Is that what you really want, Rose?

191
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,455
It is.

192
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:31,376
I don't deserve to be a knight any longer.

193
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:32,835
I will take my leave.

194
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:48,017
Excuse me, are you Captain Rose?

195
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,105
I am, and you two are?

196
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:56,734
My good-for-nothing son
was under your care.

197
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,696
Oh, his name was Josh.

198
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,742
I see...

199
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,202
I am very sorry.

200
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,830
He died...

201
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,999
because of me.

202
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,711
Thank you very much.

203
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:17,714
Thank you for bringing him back to us...

204
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,634
so that we could see him again.

205
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,929
He had a satisfied look on his face.

206
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,015
He was quite the delinquent,

207
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:30,727
but he started to brighten up
after he joined your squad.

208
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,645
We are in your debt.

209
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:57,001
(One month later.)

210
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,214
The king himself
paid you a visit, didn't he?

211
00:14:00,719 --> 00:14:04,010
Yeah, he did. Gave me quite a shock.

212
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,723
I still can't believe he came
all this way. By himself.

213
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:12,894
It's because you've been
keeping to yourself for a month!

214
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:15,146
Did he try to convince you
to come back to duty?

215
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,314
Nope.

216
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:19,692
Lloyd-sama came here
for the same reason as you.

217
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,613
To make sure I didn't try
to join those guys.

218
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,613
Got it?

219
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,784
Tell you the truth...

220
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,494
dying might not be so bad after all.

221
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:32,997
Cut it out!

222
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,085
No need to get your panties in a bunch.

223
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,505
It just crossed my mind. That's all.

224
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,169
If you say so.

225
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,807
The injuries caused by that
sword seem to be healing.

226
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:51,891
Yeah.

227
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:54,601
Evidently, the curse is only temporary.

228
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,978
Then why...

229
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:57,814
haven't you tried healing your right eye?

230
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,990
<i>This injury...</i>

231
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:12,203
<i>is the proof of sin
that I led them to their deaths.</i>

232
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:15,915
<i>It's so that I don't forget their deaths.</i>

233
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,709
<i>I don't plan to take my own life.</i>

234
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,504
<i>It's the life Owl saved, after all...</i>

235
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,047
<i>But...</i>

236
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:28,010
What am I going to live for now?

237
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,304
Revenge?

238
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,640
To kill that man?

239
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,310
And to kill as many demons as possible?

240
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:40,773
That's not it, you idiot!

241
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,943
I need to cool my head.

242
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,980
<i>I'm pathetic.</i>

243
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,526
<i>Was I always this weak?</i>

244
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,612
<i>Was I always this frail?</i>

245
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,407
<i>How would they react...</i>

246
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,950
<i>if they could see me now?</i>

247
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,119
Let's see...

248
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,205
I think I'll laugh at you...

249
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,916
and say that you're
not being yourself at all!

250
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:42,502
Owl!

251
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,420
Listen up, Captain.

252
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,589
Nothing remains static forever.

253
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,510
Everything changes eventually.

254
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:53,304
We need to accept change to move forward.

255
00:16:54,805 --> 00:17:00,019
However, nothing will change
the fact that you were our captain.

256
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,395
That is why...

257
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,192
There's no need to
worry yourself sick over it.

258
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,070
You remembered!

259
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,447
You remembered everything
you said to me that day.

260
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,698
Then...

261
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,827
do you remember the
last thing I said to you, too?

262
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:26,712
Please stay the captain we love
and admire, forever and ever.

263
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,297
That's right!

264
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,132
What are you moping about for,

265
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,425
our ogre of a battalion commander?

266
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,429
It's not like you to be
so unsure of yourself!

267
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,849
You'd punch us if we made
the face you're making!

268
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:43,604
You'd say, "Get out there!
Time to train the hell outta you!"

269
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,564
I'm sure of it!

270
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,024
No doubt about it!

271
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,072
<i>That's right.</i>

272
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:56,033
<i>I was too focused on your deaths.</i>

273
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:00,496
<i>I forgot that you guys were
always charging forward.</i>

274
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,123
<i>That's who you guys were.</i>

275
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:17,221
<i>This is the last time
I'll show any weakness.</i>

276
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,224
<i>Please, just give me this one moment.</i>

277
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,227
<i>I won't stand still any longer!</i>

278
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,813
Captain!

279
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,658
I'm all right now.

280
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:42,204
I <i>will</i> be the captain
you loved and admired!

281
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,628
I know what I must do.

282
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,088
It's coming...

283
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:54,216
War with the demons
is just on the horizon.

284
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,511
Many knights will be dispatched
and killed on the battlefield.

285
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,431
In order to prevent that...

286
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,184
I will create an organization.

287
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,686
One to save lives and
prevent anyone from dying.

288
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,605
I need manpower.

289
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,398
At least five members.

290
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,319
I also need at least two healers.

291
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,821
And one who's just like me.

292
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,615
Not just a healer,

293
00:19:17,616 --> 00:19:21,410
but one who can roam the battlefield
and blow past any obstacle in their way.

294
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,871
An average guy probably won't cut it.

295
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,624
But, if I'm able to find
someone like that...

296
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,002
They might be able to stay alive...

297
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,838
and remain by my side.

298
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,511
I'm glad I found you.

299
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:42,515
What's with that surprised face?

300
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,517
Well... that's because...

301
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,394
of your surprising comment.

302
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:51,273
You have no idea how valuable you are.

303
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,692
Valuable?

304
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:59,073
I can't replace you with just
any old trained-up healer.

305
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:03,202
Imagine multiples of me running around.

306
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,912
It'll be the end of the world.

307
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,123
You're not supposed to be able to!

308
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:12,294
Using healing magic to surpass
your physical limitations.

309
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,880
That's something I came up with.

310
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,508
Only the two of us can do it.

311
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,302
Makes sense...

312
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,389
You, Usato...

313
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,059
You are the healer with all the
qualities I've been looking for.

314
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:32,523
You've managed to do things
that only I've been able to do.

315
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,277
You'll survive.

316
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,445
I'm sure of it.

317
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,117
What's with the grin?

318
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,744
You're creeping me out!

319
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,620
I couldn't help it!

320
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,955
We're almost there!

321
00:20:49,517 --> 00:20:54,730
<i>The beginning was sudden and silent.</i>

322
00:20:54,730 --> 00:21:02,485
<i>Then, everything before
me began to change.</i>

323
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:20,256
<i>Even the stones lying at my feet</i>

324
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:26,470
<i>seem to shine a little brighter.</i>

325
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:35,980
<i>That's because you're reflected in them.</i>

326
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:41,360
<i>Like a young leaf that's just sprouted,</i>

327
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,322
<i>you're brimming with a translucent light.</i>

328
00:21:48,784 --> 00:21:53,831
<i>Let the wind blow you onward.</i>

329
00:21:53,831 --> 00:21:59,503
<i>If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.</i>

330
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:05,593
<i>Even if you're not special,
you can be anything.</i>

331
00:22:05,593 --> 00:22:18,230
<i>Let me believe in the strength
that's awakened in your heart.</i>

332
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,844
The bridge is finally finished!

333
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,305
And Baljinak is all ready to go.

334
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,266
Let the invasion begin, huh?

335
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,516
Indeed.

336
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,395
We were a bit delayed,

337
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:36,522
but we <i>will</i> succeed...

338
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:39,441
for my Master.

339
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,069
Finally...

340
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,696
I was getting tired of waiting.

341
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,907
I can head to the front lines
after the battle begins, right?

342
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,884
Of course.

343
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:50,578
Feel free to go wild.

344
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,413
You don't have to tell me twice.

345
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:56,417
Though, it's gonna be over all too soon.

346
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,335
They're only human, after all.

347
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,171
I don't doubt your strength,

348
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,715
but don't let your guard down.

349
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,467
There are some troublesome
pests on the human side.

350
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,053
The Kidnappers.

351
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:12,224
The ones who snatch
the fallen away to safety?

352
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,104
Why must we be wary of those
who only know how to run?

353
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:18,522
Don't underestimate them.

354
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,024
They are monsters.

355
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,776
If they really <i>are</i> monsters,

356
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:24,945
I might just end up enjoying myself.

357
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,573
Who cares if they're humans or monsters?

358
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:30,784
If they can satisfy me, bring them on.

359
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,996
Show me what it's like...

360
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:35,789
to be alive!
