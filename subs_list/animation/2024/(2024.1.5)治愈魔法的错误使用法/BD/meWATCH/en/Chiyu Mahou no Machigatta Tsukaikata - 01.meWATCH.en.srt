1
00:00:03,744 --> 00:00:05,672
They were so cool today!

2
00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:07,799
I wonder if they're going out...

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,177
I hate to admit it, but they
make a perfect couple.

4
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,647
Come! It is finally time for
the student council to shine.

5
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:25,150
Let's live up to everyone's expectations
and get those school rules amended.

6
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,277
Indeed, Inukami-senpai.

7
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,541
I've already gathered all the
materials to make our case.

8
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:36,203
<i>In this world, there are people who
constantly bask in the limelight.</i>

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,372
See ya later, Usato.

10
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,414
See you!

11
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,166
Till tomorrow!

12
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:44,253
<i>I'm the total opposite.</i>

13
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:47,422
<i>I'm your average high school student
who doesn't stand out at all.</i>

14
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,635
<i>The only out-of-the-ordinary
things that happen to me...</i>

15
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,974
<i>are things like this.</i>

16
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,602
Do you best and get big and strong!

17
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,669
Come pay me back when you feel like it.

18
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:05,607
Like that'll happen.

19
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,529
<i>But deep down, I envy those people.</i>

20
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:15,993
<i>I want a life that's
out of the ordinary, too.</i>

21
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:19,913
(#1 Dragged Into Another World!)

22
00:01:20,585 --> 00:01:21,832
It's gone.

23
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,085
<i>Someone must have taken it.</i>

24
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:26,920
It's not my lucky day.

25
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,761
<i>No, no! I can't just take it!</i>

26
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,681
<i>I'd feel bad for the owner, and I don't
want to deal with the consequences.</i>

27
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:45,272
If only I could use magic.

28
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,611
Guess I'll wait it out.

29
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,033
It's not stopping!

30
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:56,700
Oh?

31
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,245
What's going on here?

32
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:03,749
By any chance, do you
not have an umbrella?

33
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:06,877
T-that's... right.

34
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:07,961
I see...

35
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,090
But it's almost school closing time.

36
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,635
I-I guess you're right.

37
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,261
Then I'll be heading home now.

38
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,096
Wait, hold on.

39
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:22,059
A member of the student council will
not let you get drenched by the rain.

40
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:26,355
In that case, I'll just have
to lend Usato my spare.

41
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,149
Is he a friend of yours, Kazuki-kun?

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,943
He's a classmate.

43
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:36,657
<i>He knows my name even
though we've never spoken?</i>

44
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,784
Please use this, Usato-kun.

45
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,845
<i>Guess he's a pretty nice guy after all...</i>

46
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,581
<i>this Ryusen Kazuki.</i>

47
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,461
T-thank you, Ryusen-kun.

48
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:53,090
We're classmates. You
don't need to be so stiff.

49
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,475
I'll call you...

50
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:55,476
Hm...

51
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,221
Usato? No, Ken?

52
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:01,390
Usato's fine.

53
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:04,142
I like being called that.

54
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,519
Got it, Usato.

55
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,605
I'll call you Usato, too.

56
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,856
Is that all right with you, Usato-kun?

57
00:03:11,388 --> 00:03:13,276
T-that's fine with me.

58
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,862
Well then, Usato. Shall we
walk home together?

59
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:19,408
Good idea. It must be fate
that brought us together.

60
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:23,411
<i>Getting to walk home
with the popular kids?</i>

61
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,164
Everyone's going to get jealous!

62
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,835
Oh, er, that was nothing.

63
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,882
Honestly, Kazuki, I thought
you were far more aloof.

64
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,843
Where'd that come from?

65
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,722
I mean, you're only ever
talking to the girls in class.

66
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,766
<i>They</i> talk to me. I just respond.

67
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,482
In other words, no guys
ever come talking to you.

68
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:50,397
Am I right, Kazuki-kun?

69
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,032
S-senpai!

70
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,859
Kidding, kidding!

71
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,903
Well, I thought you were
even worse, Inukami-senpai.

72
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,448
You were like a goddess, after all.

73
00:03:59,766 --> 00:04:03,660
That's mean! I'm just your
average 12th grader, you know?

74
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,787
There's no way you're "just average."

75
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,207
You top every subject
and are great at sports.

76
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,001
On top of that, you're
both kind and pretty.

77
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,546
You should look at yourself
a little bit more objectively.

78
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,923
That was unusually mean, Kazuki-kun.

79
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,300
Now, we're even.

80
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,597
Just out of curiosity,
are you two dating?

81
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:28,727
N-no! That's just the rumor
that's been going around.

82
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:31,772
Come on. That rumor's ridiculous.

83
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:37,194
Indeed. We're around each other a lot
because we're both on the student council.

84
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:38,737
You're joking!

85
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,697
Why would we be?

86
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:44,269
I know there are many
who think we're dating,

87
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,122
but you're the first to say it
to our faces, Usato-kun.

88
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,332
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:51,326 --> 00:04:52,882
I meant that as a compliment.

90
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:55,315
It's way better than
talking behind our backs.

91
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,927
Might I ask you something, too?

92
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:08,266
Usato-kun, do you have
any plans for the future?

93
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,770
M-me? Nothing yet.

94
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,314
I see. None yet, huh?

95
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,528
You asked me that, too, didn't you?

96
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,823
I can't help but wonder, you see...

97
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,493
That's because I have none myself.

98
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,913
Huh? You don't have any plans
for the future, Inukami-senpai?

99
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,123
Aren't you about to graduate?

100
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:35,043
I suppose.

101
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:38,713
But I don't have anything to strive for.

102
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,883
When I set my mind on something,
I manage to achieve it in no time.

103
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,344
I-I see...

104
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:48,723
<i>I'm just the opposite. That's
a problem only for the gifted.</i>

105
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,475
I don't know...

106
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,644
This isn't where I belong.

107
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,105
That's what I end up feeling sometimes.

108
00:05:56,494 --> 00:05:58,692
<i>Even though I'm just the opposite...</i>

109
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:01,611
<i>I know that feeling all too well.</i>

110
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,372
What was that sound?

111
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,332
Is something wrong?

112
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,628
Usato, did you hear something
just now? It sounded like a bell.

113
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,214
No, I don't think I did...

114
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,511
I hear it.

115
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,638
It's getting louder!

116
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,308
Where is it coming from?

117
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,226
I can't hear anything...

118
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,061
Are you guys all right?

119
00:06:42,872 --> 00:06:44,654
A magic circle?

120
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,574
W-what's this? Is this for television?

121
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,618
Don't tell me... a gate to another world?

122
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,328
Huh? What are you talking about?

123
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:52,792
Usato-kun...

124
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,415
Do you think there'll be
magic and monsters and...

125
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,377
e-even heroes in this new world?

126
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,257
<i>Does Inukami-senpai have a thing for them?</i>

127
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,884
<i>Wait, this is no time for...!</i>

128
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,268
Usato!

129
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,519
Hey, Usato!

130
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,864
You okay, Usato?

131
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,033
Y-yeah...

132
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,119
Kazuki, just what on Earth is this place?

133
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,748
W-who are those guys?

134
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,041
I have no idea.

135
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,919
I was just woken up by senpai.

136
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,712
That's right! Where's senpai?

137
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,884
It's just as you said, Usato-kun!

138
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,054
This is probably...

139
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,223
<i>She's super hyped!</i>

140
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:56,393
I see that all of you have awakened.

141
00:07:56,393 --> 00:08:00,230
It is only natural that you are
confused after being brought here...

142
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,024
Who are you! What have you done to us!

143
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,069
Impertinence! That is no way
to speak to Lloyd-sama!

144
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:07,737
It is quite all right.

145
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:12,200
My apologies. I empathize
with your situation.

146
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,621
However, I implore you
to listen to my words.

147
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:22,044
My name is Lloyd Vulgast Llinger.
The king of Llinger Kingdom.

148
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,797
A king!

149
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,618
In the flesh!

150
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,926
Er... Senpai?

151
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:36,057
To get straight to the point, you were
summoned to the Llinger Kingdom...

152
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,517
as heroes.

153
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,769
What? Heroes?

154
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:41,228
There it is!

155
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,607
Please! Stop ruining my
image of you already!

156
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:50,113
Two years ago, we came under siege
by this world's king of demons.

157
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,574
King of... demons?

158
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,158
A-a Demon Lord?

159
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,996
They're being serious!
Could you please settle down?

160
00:08:58,393 --> 00:09:03,418
Indeed. The Demon Lord led an army
and launched an attack on our kingdom.

161
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,213
After an intense battle, we
barely managed to repel them.

162
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,216
Since then, the Demon Lord has
been strengthening his forces.

163
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,844
We might not be so lucky the next time.

164
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,180
As a last resort, we turned to
a forbidden magic that allows us

165
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,477
to summon those from another world with
the potential to oppose the Demon Lord...

166
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,771
the Hero Summon!

167
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,523
A forbidden summon!

168
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,150
Don't give me that crap!

169
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,236
Heroes... Demon Lord...

170
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,031
You dragged us here to
serve your own selfish ends!

171
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,158
Send us back to our own world at once!

172
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,203
I'm sorry, but that is not possible.

173
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,331
At this moment, the Hero Summon
only works in one direction.

174
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:45,168
We can bring you here,
but we can't send you back.

175
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,780
Then, what's going to happen to us?

176
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,642
I have family back there!

177
00:09:49,643 --> 00:09:51,633
So does senpai and Usato.

178
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:56,137
I empathize, but we are desperate.

179
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:58,056
You think that's going to cut--

180
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,146
Wait! Hold on for a second, Kazuki.

181
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,066
I'm flattered that you're
getting angry for our sakes,

182
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,443
but making a scene
here will get us nowhere.

183
00:10:10,445 --> 00:10:11,361
Okay?

184
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:29,379
I swear that we will find a way to
send you home in the near future.

185
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:32,674
In the meantime, I implore
you to lend us your powers...

186
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,093
our heroes.

187
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:41,390
King Lloyd?

188
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,686
Might I ask a question?

189
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:45,353
Of course.

190
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,356
Why do you call us heroes?

191
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,985
I don't think you know
anything about us...

192
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,654
For that question...

193
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,947
Welcie.

194
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:56,656
Certainly.

195
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:59,593
The Hero Summon magic
circle contains a spell

196
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:03,413
that seeks out those with hero potential.

197
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,584
You should have heard the sound
of a bell upon your summoning.

198
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,253
That is proof of your hero potential.

199
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,546
I see. So that's what that sound was.

200
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:14,591
Wait.

201
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,551
Usato, didn't you say...

202
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:17,844
Y-yeah.

203
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,138
I didn't hear anything...

204
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,932
Does that mean...

205
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,727
I was just caught up in it?

206
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,900
Now then, Kazuki-sama,
Suzune-sama, Usato-sama.

207
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,236
I'll be seeing what your magical
aptitude is with this crystal ball.

208
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,824
You can do that with this crystal ball?

209
00:11:39,826 --> 00:11:42,535
Yes. I'll begin the preparations at once.

210
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,914
You sure you don't mind, Usato?

211
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:50,501
Welcie said that I might be able to
use magic even though I'm not a hero.

212
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,504
I'm glad that I can be
tested along with you guys.

213
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,048
No, not that.

214
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,467
I'm talking about being dragged
here against your will.

215
00:11:57,468 --> 00:11:59,928
And in your case, by accident.

216
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:02,680
Aren't you upset?

217
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:06,142
Well, there's no point in getting angry.

218
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,646
It's better to focus on doing what I can.

219
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,108
You're far more level-headed
than I thought.

220
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,323
You think so?

221
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:17,946
I think Inukami-senpai's
taking it far better than I am...

222
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:18,863
I mean, just look at her.

223
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,491
I guess you have a point.

224
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,285
Welcie-san, can we start yet? Can we?

225
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,955
We need to learn from her optimism.

226
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,058
<i>I don't think that's just optimism...</i>

227
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:31,501
<i>but I'll keep that to myself.</i>

228
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,133
All right. Please place your
hand on the ball, Suzune-sama.

229
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,844
Here I go!

230
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:47,809
It changed color!

231
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:53,856
This color means that you have
an aptitude for thunder magic!

232
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:56,442
You also have ample
mana reserves. Amazing!

233
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,610
Thunder?

234
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,571
She looks happy.

235
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:04,158
<i>I mean... thunder</i> is <i>the perfect
attribute for a fantasy nut like her.</i>

236
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,411
Kazuki-sama, you're next.

237
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:07,620
Coming.

238
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,378
Wow, this is the color of light!

239
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:18,172
Light? What can I do?

240
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,674
Blind people with it?

241
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,427
You can fire off a laser, Kazuki-kun!

242
00:13:22,428 --> 00:13:24,595
Or perhaps slash 'em with a lightsaber...

243
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,474
Senpai... he won't get those references...

244
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:32,520
That was rather cutting.

245
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:35,106
I don't hate that in a man.

246
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:39,902
<i>Please stop! My image of you has
already been shattered into ruins!</i>

247
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:44,782
Light magic is amazing!
Only a few can wield it!

248
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,197
Extinguish evil with light!

249
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,080
Against demons, light's
power is unparalleled!

250
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,874
I see.

251
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:53,458
Indeed!

252
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,419
Next is Usato-sama. Your hand, please.

253
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,879
Oh, right away!

254
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,969
<i>I wonder if I have any magical powers.</i>

255
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:10,683
<i>If I do, I hope it's something
that can aid senpai and Kazuki.</i>

256
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,483
It's a pretty green... like an emerald.

257
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,778
Yeah... it's a calming color.

258
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,363
Welcie-san, what attribute does he have?

259
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,453
I-I have to tell them.

260
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,866
I <i>have</i> to tell them!

261
00:14:33,868 --> 00:14:34,832
- Welcie-san?
I <i>have</i> to tell them!

262
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,959
The two of you, please
just stay where you are!

263
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:42,298
Lloyd-sama!

264
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,300
Oh! Welcie.

265
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,220
Have you determined Suzune and
Kazuki's magical aptitudes yet?

266
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,598
They have great magical potential and all,

267
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,974
but more importantly... Usato-sama!

268
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:58,457
What about him? Don't tell me
he can control dark magic?

269
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,984
The crystal... turned green.

270
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,654
What? Are you certain?

271
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:08,806
Yes. This would mean that his
attribute is the extremely rare--

272
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,493
Silence! Don't say it!

273
00:15:11,953 --> 00:15:14,163
<i>Is my attribute</i> that <i>bad?</i>

274
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:17,500
We need to get him as far away
from the castle as possible!

275
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,044
Is there anywhere safe?

276
00:15:20,304 --> 00:15:22,755
W-what about we get him
into town for the time being?

277
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,714
G-good idea.

278
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,633
Make preparations at once...

279
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,761
I don't understand.

280
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,556
Am I dangerous or something?

281
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:34,475
Is there anyone else with my attribute?

282
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:37,895
There is. There is, but...

283
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:40,815
She's bad news! <i>Really</i> bad news!

284
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,704
Oh, dear...

285
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,124
S-speak of the devil!

286
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:04,714
Lloyd-sama. How did
the summoning ritual go?

287
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,841
Are the heroes here already?

288
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:11,053
R-Rose! Weren't you on leave today?

289
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:15,683
You jest. A servant of the king on leave?

290
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,441
You the hero?

291
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,818
N-no, he isn't!

292
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:30,155
He was summoned here by mistake!

293
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:33,826
He's average! Just an average,
normal, run-of-the-mill boy!

294
00:16:39,773 --> 00:16:42,433
Oh? Is that so?

295
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,419
Hey, kid?

296
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,127
Yes ma'am?!

297
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,827
What do they call you?

298
00:16:45,828 --> 00:16:48,382
U-Usato!

299
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:50,391
Usato, huh?

300
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:55,515
I'm Rose. I'm the captain of
the kingdom's Rescue Squad.

301
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:57,475
Pleasure to meet you.

302
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,678
Rescue Squad?

303
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:05,107
She looks like someone who
should be killing, not rescuing!

304
00:17:05,308 --> 00:17:08,895
R-Rose-sama. The heroes are
waiting by the crystal ball.

305
00:17:08,904 --> 00:17:10,196
I'll take you there at once.

306
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:13,342
Very well. If you'd
excuse me, Lloyd-sama.

307
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,415
Usato, we'll figure out
what to do with you later.

308
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,502
I'll have a room prepared for you,
so just sit back and relax.

309
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,490
Right... but I haven't
heard about my magic yet.

310
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:31,551
What attribute does green signify?

311
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,683
Green... you say?

312
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:40,601
Yeah.

313
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:44,021
Lloyd-sama, I'll be borrowing this boy.

314
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,440
Welcie! Get Usato away from here!

315
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,608
R-right away!

316
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,079
Wait, Rose!

317
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:28,774
Lloyd-sama.

318
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:36,157
I'll turn this boy into a
proper healer. You'll see!

319
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,408
Wait, Rose, please!

320
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,621
I know you want to recruit more healers,

321
00:18:41,622 --> 00:18:47,543
but Usato really was
summoned by accident!

322
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,754
What? He was taken?!

323
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,965
What do you mean? Is Usato in danger?

324
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,319
Oh, not at all!

325
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,511
It's not like he's going
to get killed or anything.

326
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:58,638
Then?

327
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:03,559
He was taken away to a location
a little away from the castle...

328
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,064
beyond the castle town
by... the Rescue Squad.

329
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,982
The Rescue Squad?

330
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,320
The attribute that was revealed
by the crystal... was healing.

331
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,701
Healers are pretty rare,
and Rose is one such healer.

332
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,747
She plans to take Usato-sama
under her wing as her subordinate.

333
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:28,584
In that case, there doesn't
seem to be a problem.

334
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,337
The thing is... how should I put this?

335
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:37,281
Her training methods are
a little bit... unorthodox.

336
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:41,265
Those who undergo her
training become a little...

337
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,561
A healer?

338
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,855
Me?

339
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,067
You have the potential to become one.

340
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:56,278
That is why I brought you here.

341
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,508
From today, this will be your home.

342
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,200
Come here, you guys!

343
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,621
You called, Big Sis Rose?!

344
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,749
These guys are freaking scary!

345
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,962
This here is Usato. We're gonna
be taking care of him. Be nice.

346
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:14,463
Roger that!

347
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,637
The name's Tong. Nice to meet'cha, newbie.

348
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,931
I'm Mill. Nice to meet'cha, newbie.

349
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,267
I'm Alec. Nice to meet'cha, newbie.

350
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,310
I'm Gomul. Nice to meet'cha, newbie.

351
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,896
I'm Gurd. Nice to meet'cha, newbie.

352
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,910
I-I'm sorry!

353
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:37,737
<i>Am I the offering?
Am I going to be sacrificed?</i>

354
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,159
Don't scare the newbie, you assholes!

355
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,996
Come on! This is our
way of an introduction!

356
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,623
We were being super nice!

357
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:52,334
<i>Nice?! Do these guys even
know what that word means?</i>

358
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:57,965
They are my subordinates,
but they're not healers.

359
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:04,013
The Rescue Squad has two more healers,
but they're stationed somewhere else.

360
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,056
And that is why...

361
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,141
And that is why...?

362
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:11,353
I will drill into you how to
use healing magic myself.

363
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,856
<i>N-no, not this person!</i>

364
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,524
<i>That's what my instincts are
screaming at the top of their lungs!</i>

365
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,445
Might I request a change of instructor...?

366
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:22,031
Training begins tomorrow.
Prepare yourself.

367
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,909
<i>Does my opinion mean nothing to you?!</i>

368
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,577
As for your quarters...

369
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:30,873
Tong, you still have space in
your room? Show him the ropes.

370
00:21:31,065 --> 00:21:32,875
R-roger that.

371
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:35,377
Have your dinner and rest well.

372
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,673
Yer screwed.

373
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,134
Big Sis gonna train ya personally, huh?

374
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,178
Yer in for one hell of a time.

375
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,263
Hell's nothin' in comparison.

376
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,480
What's going to happen to me?

377
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,542
Guess there's no point worrying.

378
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:00,361
Sleep it is.

379
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:04,615
A healer from another world, huh?

380
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,954
Let's see where this goes, shall we?

381
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:29,223
(The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic)

382
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,017
<i>The walls that tower over you</i>

383
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,689
<i>are just so tall and thick.</i>

384
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:41,151
<i>They're not there to overwhelm you.</i>

385
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:45,614
<i>They're there for you to overcome.</i>

386
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:49,994
<i>That's what I believe.</i>

387
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:52,079
<i>For thousands of nights</i>

388
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,456
<i>and tens of thousands of mornings,</i>

389
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,084
<i>I can keep trying</i>

390
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,878
<i>without losing my way.</i>

391
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,921
<i>As long as I can arrive</i>

392
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,257
<i>at the final chapter,</i>

393
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,094
<i>it's okay even if</i>

394
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,346
<i>I'm scarred.</i>

395
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,974
<i>Stand! Up! Again!</i>

396
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,767
<i>Over and over!</i>

397
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,437
<i>Don't! Look! Back!</i>

398
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:19,690
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

399
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:22,776
<i>Only towards the future.</i>
