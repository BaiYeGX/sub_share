1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:06,006
This forest is also known as
the Darkness of Llinger.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,672
It's famous for teeming with monsters.

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,220
You're not coming home until
you kill a Grand Grizzly.

4
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:14,973
What?! W-wait a minute!

5
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:17,722
N-no! Please stop! Don't pick me up!

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,935
Don't throw me, either!

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,071
This is bad! This is bad! This is bad!

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,698
I'm gonna die!

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,906
Cause of death: Thrown by
the Rescue Squad Captain!

10
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,325
This isn't funny!

11
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:47,544
I'm <i>not</i> going to die here!

12
00:00:50,926 --> 00:00:52,928
I'm alive!

13
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,634
Thank goodness!

14
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:59,184
But now that I've entered the forest,

15
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:04,394
I guess I've gotta do what
Rose says if I want to go home.

16
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,821
A-all right! Kill a Grand Grizzly it is!

17
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,949
I mean, it's only a two-meter tall bear.

18
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,613
That's nothing for someone
who survived hell--

19
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,992
<i>No way!</i>

21
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,055
<i>The walls that tower over you</i>

22
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:45,727
<i>are just so tall and thick.</i>

23
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,189
<i>They're not there to overwhelm you.</i>

24
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:54,652
<i>They're there for you to overcome.</i>

25
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,952
<i>That's what I believe.</i>

26
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,037
<i>For thousands of nights</i>

27
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:03,494
<i>and tens of thousands of mornings,</i>

28
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,042
<i>I can keep trying</i>

29
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,836
<i>without losing my way.</i>

30
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,879
<i>As long as I can arrive</i>

31
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,295
<i>at the final chapter,</i>

32
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:16,132
<i>it's okay even if</i>

33
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,304
<i>I'm scarred.</i>

34
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,932
<i>Stand! Up! Again!</i>

35
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,725
<i>Over and over!</i>

36
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,395
<i>Don't! Look! Back!</i>

37
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,728
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

38
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,814
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,211
(#3 Ruthless! The Darkness of Llinger!)

40
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,760
<i>It's coming after me!</i>

41
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,595
<i>It's far bigger than I thought!</i>

42
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,885
<i>It's teeth and claws are hella huge!</i>

43
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,641
<i>But!</i>

44
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,264
<i>I</i> know <i>I can outrun it!</i>

45
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,605
<i>No bear's gonna catch me!</i>

46
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,894
<i>It's right behind me!</i>

47
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,067
<i>Hold on! Think this through.</i>

48
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,819
<i>I've managed to make it
through that hellish training.</i>

49
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,193
<i>This guy's nothing compared to Rose!</i>

50
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,326
Come at me, bear!

51
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,532
If it's a one-on-one fight--

52
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,787
That's cheating!

53
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,499
No one told me there'd
be Blue Grizzlies, too!

54
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,627
<i>This sound!</i>

55
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,202
That was horrible.

56
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:12,165
Some rations, a canteen, and a knife.

57
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,172
You could have at least given me
something to start a fire with.

58
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,841
Rose...

59
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:18,713
you demon.

60
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:22,383
Nah, she's more of an ogre.

61
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,473
<i>Kill a Grand Grizzly?</i>

62
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,806
<i>No way that's gonna happen.</i>

63
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,146
<i>Oh, well... I'll figure out
what to do tomorrow.</i>

64
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:39,317
<i>That's the end of Day One.</i>

65
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,080
Okay, let's do this.

66
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,804
<i>First thing's first.</i>

67
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,053
<i>Gotta know my opponent.</i>

68
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,265
<i>Let's figure out where it lives.</i>

69
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,148
<i>Claw marks?!</i>

70
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,958
<i>Are those the Grand Grizzly's?</i>

71
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,861
<i>Could it be nearby?</i>

72
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,253
A rabbit?

73
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:40,003
No, a rabbit-like monster?

74
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,426
Are you hurt?

75
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,432
<i>It understands me?</i>

76
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,597
<i>Nah, can't be.</i>

77
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:52,140
Let me take a look at that.

78
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,899
I healed it for you.

79
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,236
Don't get hurt again, okay?

80
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,209
Don't follow me!

81
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,254
I'm trying to find a scary monster!

82
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:21,127
It's dangerous to be with me!

83
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,388
I said no!

84
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:37,518
...or do you happen to know
where the Grand Grizzly is?

85
00:06:46,261 --> 00:06:47,445
You're kidding!

86
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,041
<i>It wasn't kidding!</i>

87
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,873
<i>That must be its den.</i>

88
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,044
<i>Right, now to observe it
without being spotted.</i>

89
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,925
<i>They look like a family.</i>

90
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,512
<i>The book said that Grand
Grizzlies live in groups.</i>

91
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,261
<i>I guess this counts?</i>

92
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,271
<i>I don't think it's a good idea
to drink untreated water...</i>

93
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,856
<i>but I've got no choice.</i>

94
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,029
I thought you left.

95
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,656
You're back again?

96
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,454
You're a strange one, aren't you?

97
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,869
We're just looking today, okay?

98
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,331
<i>No significant changes.</i>

99
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,751
<i>The Blue Grizzlies are
starting to look kinda cute.</i>

100
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,216
<i>This black rabbit is also really cute...</i>

101
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:49,924
<i>I'm having more fun than I thought...</i>

102
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,557
<i>My stomach hurts!</i>

103
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,181
<i>I knew I shouldn't have
drunk the river water!</i>

104
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,980
<i>Healing magic doesn't
make it better...</i>

105
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,604
<i>It's the same as being
poisoned, after all.</i>

106
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:07,191
<i>Still, there's</i> got <i>to be a way to cure it.</i>

107
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,074
It's you! Back again?

108
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:13,782
All the same, I'm glad to see you!

109
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,705
So, the water here's fine?

110
00:08:21,683 --> 00:08:25,585
It certainly <i>looks</i> cleaner
than the river water.

111
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,633
It's good! Thank you...

112
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:35,261
Hey, what is it?

113
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,735
<i>Does it sense a monster approaching?</i>

114
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,906
<i>But this guy didn't bat an
eye at the Grand Grizzly.</i>

115
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,679
<i>What</i> is <i>that?</i>

116
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:23,601
<i>There wasn't anything in
the book about</i> that<i>!</i>

117
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,021
<i>But even I can tell...</i>

118
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,402
<i>That thing's bad news.</i>

119
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,113
<i>There's nothing but
bloodlust coming from it.</i>

120
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,362
<i>I must never go near it... no matter what!</i>

121
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:43,162
<i>It's been four days since I saw
that giant snake monster.</i>

122
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,044
<i>My uneasiness wouldn't let up,</i>

123
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:50,503
<i>and I just kept observing the Grizzlies.</i>

124
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,553
<i>These guys are the same as always.</i>

125
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,593
<i>Looking at them calms me down.</i>

126
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:02,890
<i>But if I don't kill that Grand
Grizzly, I can't go home.</i>

127
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:07,603
<i>I have to do it.</i>

128
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,606
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

129
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,238
W-what is it?

130
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,882
You're telling me not to go?

131
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,258
But I have to...

132
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:24,791
Oh, very well.

133
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,251
I'll stay here till the rain stops.

134
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,357
Deal?

135
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,131
<i>All right!</i>

136
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,303
<i>Here I come, Grand Grizzly!</i>

137
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,260
<i>I'll make mincemeat out of you!</i>

138
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:43,309
There's no use stopping me.

139
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,684
I'm going to kill it and
get out of this forest.

140
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,367
Here goes nothing!

141
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,795
W-what... happened?

142
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:15,716
This is bad.

143
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,632
Rose is gonna kill me...

144
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,511
if she finds out that
something beat me to it.

145
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,226
<i>Those bite marks.</i>

146
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,811
<i>It must have have been that big snake.</i>

147
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,153
<i>But it didn't kill them for food.</i>

148
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,030
<i>It killed them for fun.</i>

149
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,446
<i>It killed them just for the sake of it.</i>

150
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,632
<i>I hate losing.</i>

151
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,802
<i>That's why I didn't want
to admit defeat to Rose.</i>

152
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,018
<i>That's why I hate having
my prey stolen from me...</i>

153
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,184
<i>and having my resolve be for nothing.</i>

154
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,229
<i>But above all...</i>

155
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:22,446
<i>I hate what I'm seeing
right in front of me.</i>

156
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,367
I will avenge you.

157
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,704
Just you wait.

158
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,552
Training in the forest?

159
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,264
You betcha. He's been gone for ten days.

160
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,763
Ten whole days? Isn't that a little long?

161
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,310
It's what Big Sis Rose decided... right?

162
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,066
S-she ain't around at the moment.

163
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,605
We don't know nothin'.

164
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:04,606
Kazuki-kun, you get all fired up
when it's about Usato-kun.

165
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,913
I mean... aren't <i>you</i> worried, Senpai?

166
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,625
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried...

167
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,482
But it's Rose-san
we're talking about.

168
00:13:15,483 --> 00:13:17,002
He'll be fine.

169
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,799
I wonder...

170
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,886
Besides, I believe in Usato-kun.

171
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,180
He'll come back in one piece.

172
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,805
Hey...! I believe in him, too.

173
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:42,738
Ready!

174
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,571
Could you lead me to where the snake is?

175
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,954
Just show me where it is.

176
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:51,660
You don't have to stay.

177
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,854
<i>I... told you to wait!</i>

178
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:25,027
<i>That thing really</i> is <i>
dangerous! I'm scared!</i>

179
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,325
<i>But...</i>

180
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:33,911
<i>there's</i> nothing <i>scarier than Rose!</i>

181
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,289
<i>It's confused! Time to strike!</i>

182
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,127
<i>That was close!</i>

183
00:14:41,317 --> 00:14:43,462
<i>But now I have you!</i>

184
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,341
Have an eyeful of this, you stupid snake!

185
00:14:53,284 --> 00:14:55,224
That's all you've got?

186
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,812
Didn't feel a thing!

187
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,028
<i>I need to aim for its blind spot.</i>

188
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,276
<i>To its right!</i>

189
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,540
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

190
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,630
<i>It purposely lured me into its blind spot!</i>

191
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,836
<i>And I fell for it!</i>

192
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,380
But...

193
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:33,262
I have a knife in my hand!

194
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:48,945
Poison?!

195
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:52,531
On top of its big size?
That's just not fair!

196
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,912
<i>But I now know how to cure it.</i>

197
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,001
<i>I figured it out from when
I got that stomachache.</i>

198
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,713
<i>If I'm being eaten away from the inside,</i>

199
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,838
<i>all I've gotta do is to heal
myself from the inside!</i>

200
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,221
What are you...

201
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,600
Got it!

202
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,277
Did you think that was
enough to get rid of me?

203
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,695
What are you,

204
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,735
stupid?!

205
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,040
This is... the end!

206
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,797
Go to hell!

207
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,611
I did it!

208
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,791
I managed to avenge you.

209
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,340
I'd love to heal your wounds,

210
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:33,215
but I used up most of
magic to cure the poison.

211
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,412
I can't even move...

212
00:17:40,405 --> 00:17:42,766
<i>You're kidding...</i>

213
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,980
Stop it! Run!

214
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,195
<i>Is this it?</i>

215
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,615
<i>Kazuki? Inukami-senpai? Rose?</i>

216
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:57,656
<i>That's right! This is all Rose's fault!</i>

217
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:05,247
Damn it, Rose! You beast!
You brute! You ogre!

218
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,076
Come on...

219
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,845
you damn dirty snake.

220
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,596
All you had to do was die.

221
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,015
R-Rose-sama!

222
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,685
How are you here?

223
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,063
It's all thanks to this guy.

224
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:36,695
This is my pet, Kukuru.
I sent it to watch over you.

225
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,865
But it was hurt when we first met!

226
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,496
Still haven't figured it out?

227
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:46,330
I had it put on an act to gain your trust.

228
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,374
No way!

229
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,881
I've been waiting at
the edge of the forest

230
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,092
just in case anything happened.

231
00:18:55,092 --> 00:19:01,432
I wasn't going to interfere, but I
never expected this thing to appear.

232
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,517
You recognize it?

233
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,645
It's a monster modified
by the Demon Lord's Army.

234
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,566
During the last invasion,
Siglis failed to finish it off.

235
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:13,360
This is where it must have run off to.

236
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,532
Still, to think it managed
to kill a Grand Grizzly.

237
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:24,076
Even our kingdom's elite forces won't be
able to beat a Grand Grizzly unscathed.

238
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,956
You knew that and still
pit me against one?!

239
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,333
<i>You heartless demon!</i>

240
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:34,006
I never expected you to win.

241
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:38,177
I just wanted you to gain experience
fighting a stronger opponent.

242
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,007
But then...

243
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:40,342
But then?

244
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:45,476
Things started to get interesting.

245
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:48,142
I wanted to see what would
happen, so I let you continue.

246
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,894
I almost died, you know?!

247
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,191
He's taken a liking to you, I see.

248
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,530
H-he has?

249
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,781
<i>Now that I think about it,
he </i>has <i>lost his parents...</i>

250
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,408
<i>He's all alone.</i>

251
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,254
I knew you were a man after my own heart.

252
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,882
Hey, Blue Grizzly!

253
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,304
You're coming with us!

254
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,178
Carry that walking corpse.

255
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,982
You're letting me ride you?

256
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:34,772
You sure?

257
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,571
Now, then. Let's go home.

258
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,700
Please, no. She scares me.

259
00:20:48,102 --> 00:20:51,792
That reminds me... what
did you call me just now?

260
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,875
A beast? A brute? An ogre?

261
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,423
You're not getting any sleep tonight!

262
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:03,425
Y-yes ma'am!

263
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:09,058
I'll say this. As for the
training, you passed...

264
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,516
with flying colors.

265
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,565
You have earned the right.

266
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,854
The right?

267
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,487
The right to stand by my side
on the battlefield.

268
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,322
You still lack training...

269
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,822
but you have it all.

270
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,579
A body that can withstand pain,
the physical prowess, and...

271
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,827
an indomitable spirit.

272
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:35,833
All the things the
other two healers lack.

273
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:37,918
Be proud.

274
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,885
We might still make it in time.

275
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,325
In time for what?

276
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:48,011
The Demon Lord's Army
will make its move soon.

277
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,229
Third Army Commander Amila Vergrett.

278
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,143
Milord.

279
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,568
How is the Llinger Kingdom
invasion coming along?

280
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,567
It is all going according to plan.

281
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:05,445
All our units are preparing for battle.

282
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:10,033
We will soon be able to advance.

283
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:15,709
<i>The beginning was sudden and silent.</i>

284
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:23,463
<i>Then, everything before
me began to change.</i>

285
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:41,235
<i>Even the stones lying at my feet</i>

286
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:47,449
<i>seem to shine a little brighter.</i>

287
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:56,959
<i>That's because you're reflected in them.</i>

288
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:02,339
<i>Like a young leaf that's just sprouted,</i>

289
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:08,300
<i>you're brimming with a translucent light.</i>

290
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:14,810
<i>Let the wind blow you onward.</i>

291
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:20,482
<i>If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.</i>

292
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:26,572
<i>Even if you're not special,
you can be anything.</i>

293
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:39,289
<i>Let me believe in the strength
that's awakened in your heart.</i>
