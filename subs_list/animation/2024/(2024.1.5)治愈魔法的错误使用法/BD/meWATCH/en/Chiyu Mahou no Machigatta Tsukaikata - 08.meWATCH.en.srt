1
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:06,465
This is taking forever...

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,886
We're only halfway there, right?

3
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,264
Duh. We're gonna be fightin' the demons.

4
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,226
Can't do that too close
to the castle, can we?

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,228
I guess not.

6
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,523
They're coming to invade us, after all...

7
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:26,068
Er, Captain?

8
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:28,403
What are demons like?

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,197
Let's see...

10
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:33,033
Demons are demihumans with unusual horns.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,994
They look human at a glance,

12
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:40,707
but they surpass humans
in both strength and magic.

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:44,044
They surpass humans...

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,215
The commanders are obviously tough,
but even the regular soldiers are no joke.

15
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,384
You scared?

16
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,886
I know someone even scarier.

17
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,304
I'll be just fine.

18
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,431
You never know when to shut up.

19
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,352
To think you were just some guy who
got caught up in the Hero Summon.

20
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:02,688
Look how far you've come.

21
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,900
That's rich, after the hell
you put me through.

22
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:11,238
I just wanted to do everything
I could to show you up.

23
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:13,615
No, I didn't mean...

26
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:59,511

<i>They're not there to overwhelm you.</i>

00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:08,436
<i>They're there for you to overcome.</i>

29
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:12,816
<i>That's what I believe.</i>

30
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:14,901
<i>For thousands of nights</i>

31
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,278
<i>and tens of thousands of mornings,</i>

00:02:17,654 --> 00:02:19,906
<i>I can keep trying</i>

33
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,700
<i>without losing my way.</i>

34
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,743

<i>I'm scarred.</i>

38

00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:36,589
<i>Over and over!</i>

00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,259
<i>Don't! Look! Back!</i>

41
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,512
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

42
00:02:43,679 --> 00:02:45,681
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

(#8 Battalion Commander Rose)

44
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,855
(Five Years Ago)

45
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,614
I am grateful to see all of you here.

46
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,827
Recently, demons have been spotted

47
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:25,288
in the plains near the
Darkness of Llinger.

48
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,457
Quite frequently, in fact.

49
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:33,130
No one has been attacked yet,
but it's only a matter of time.

50
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,882
Just in case, we'll be assigning guards

51
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,803
to the merchants who will
be passing by the plains.

52
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:45,100
Guard duty will be entrusted to
officers below the rank of general.

53
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,771
However, demons are stronger than humans.

54
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:52,774
If a fight breaks out, run.

55
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,529
Rose.

56
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,533
What do you think the demons are planning?

57
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,412
Who knows? I sure don't.

58
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,372
But if I had to guess...

59
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,918
Don't tell me, they're
preparing for an invasion?

60
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,838
Do they have the means?

61
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,382
It's just a possibility.

62
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:22,596
I'll get the troops ready to
mobilize at any time.

63
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,598
It might be a waste of time.

64
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,516
We can only hope it will be.

65
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,061
We need to be able to respond
at a moment's notice.

66
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,607
You still take things way too seriously.

67
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:35,275
I heard that.

68
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:37,778
You were supposed to.

69
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,784
<i>I'd better do the same, too.</i>

70
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:44,785
Captain!

71
00:04:44,787 --> 00:04:47,829
<i>Still, we need more information.</i>

72
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,498
Hey, Captain?!

73
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,292
<i>We should send someone
on a reconnaissance mission.</i>

74
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,224
<i>No, that's a job for the generals...</i>

75
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:55,796
Come on, Captain!

76
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,714
Shut the hell up!

77
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,009
You nearly split my head open!

78
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:05,346
You could have killed me
with that brute strength of yours!

79
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,307
Shut it! Like I give a crap.

80
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:10,101
Keep quiet while others are thinking.

81
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,604
My boss is way too mean!

82
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,863
All jokes aside, Captain...

83
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:18,527
that was really serious, wasn't it?

84
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,403
I didn't think demons would show up...

85
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,324
W-why?

86
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,743
That's for listening in on
classified information.

87
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,662
Sorry...

88
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:30,121
For the love of...

89
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:34,668
When will you learn to stick to the rules?

90
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:39,005
Seriously, what are the demons up to?

91
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,424
Nothing good, that's for sure.

92
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,093
Yeah...

93
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,679
Oh, well. When the time comes,

94
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,391
all we have to do is drive them away!

95
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,267
Owl...

96
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,518
underestimating the enemy invites death.

97
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,230
Oh, no, I know that!

98
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:57,232
I wasn't underestimating them at all!

99
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,859
You could have fooled me.

100
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,695
I-I'm serious!

101
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:05,282
You've beat that into me... literally.

102
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:06,366
That settles it.

103
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,660
I'll oversee your afternoon training.

104
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,828
No, no, no!

105
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:13,498
You're a battalion commander now.
You're way too busy for that!

106
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,167
We don't want to get
in the way of your work.

107
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,004
Oh! Welcome back, Captain!

108
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,714
Good to see you back!

109
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,716
What's up, Vice-Captain?

110
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,009
You look pale.

111
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:25,969
No, it's nothing...

112
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:30,181
We were just talking about how
I'm going to have to retrain you guys...

113
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,348
What?!

114
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,602
Owl! What did you do?!

115
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,603
What do you mean?

116
00:06:34,604 --> 00:06:36,104
I didn't do anything!

117
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,689
You said something, didn't you?

118
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,984
N-no! Er...

119
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:41,902
Oh! That's right!

120
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:45,488
I noticed that you guys
have been slacking off recently...

121
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,950
This is my gift to you as Vice-Captain...

122
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,702
Don't mess with us!

123
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,078
Aren't <i>you</i> the biggest slacker!

124
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,748
Leave us out of it!

125
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,665
Ow, that hurt!

126
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,293
How dare you raise your
hand to a superior officer!

127
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,587
Oh, Kukuru.

128
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,506
Captain! Get them to stop!

129
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,382
None of my business.

130
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,258
How heartless!

131
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,972
About the demons...

132
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:16,186
It seems like they've been attacking
monsters in our territory.

133
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:22,484
According to eyewitnesses,
it was a group of trained soldiers.

134
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:26,988
It was a deliberate
and coordinated effort?

135
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,573
Something smells off.

136
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:32,786
Rose, find out the reason
behind their actions.

137
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,955
If the need arises...

138
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,707
I'm authorized to use force?

139
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:39,668
Indeed.

140
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,046
I trust that you won't act rashly.

141
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,882
Your faith in me is greatly appreciated.

142
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,802
I will deliver results.

143
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,264
...and that's how it is.

144
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:56,267
You're heading to
the Darkness of Llinger...

145
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,269
and departing at dawn tomorrow.

146
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,105
Any questions?

147
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,816
How many demons are we talking about?

148
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,694
Between 10 to 30 have been sighted.

149
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,323
Fighting them might prove difficult.

150
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,783
All right, then.

151
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,994
Let's not let our guard
down while we prepare.

152
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,704
You're one to talk!

153
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,916
You're the reason why
we suffered this past week!

154
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,293
Repent! You stupid Vice-Captain!

155
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,590
But because of that, you
guys are all nice and toned!

156
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,134
The mission is gonna
be a walk in the park!

157
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,053
Stop throwing things! That's dangerous!

158
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,434
Kukuru. You're staying home.

159
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,813
It's true that you can detect monsters

160
00:08:41,814 --> 00:08:43,273
and make our search easier.

161
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:47,277
But you might be targeted by the demons.

162
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,903
I don't want to put you in danger.

163
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,242
Captain! They're so mean!

164
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:57,162
Listen up!

165
00:08:57,412 --> 00:09:02,167
This mission demands the best from us.

166
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:05,086
Therefore, I will be joining you guys.

167
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:07,922
Really?!

168
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:12,385
If you're fighting alongside us,
we'll be invincible!

169
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:15,930
If anything happens,
you can just heal us with your magic!

170
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,890
Yeah!

171
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,475
No need to worry about getting hurt!

172
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:19,809
We can go all out!

173
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,520
In other words... go wild!

174
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,023
All right, everyone!

175
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:27,442
Let's kick some demon butt!

176
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,818
Yeah!!!

177
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,904
Goodness...

178
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,989
What am I gonna do with these guys?

179
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:36,534
Quit the chitchat and
start preparing at once!

180
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:37,410
Yes, ma'am!

181
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,889
Listen, everyone!

182
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,683
Today's search was a bust,

183
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:02,602
but after consulting with the captain,

184
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,605
we've decided to search the
western side of the forest tomorrow.

185
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,815
The western side?

186
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,733
The terrain's really rough there.

187
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,442
Right.

188
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,277
That's why we'll be
leaving our horses behind.

189
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:15,281
Shouldn't we prioritize the areas
we can search on horseback?

190
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,074
No.

191
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:20,703
There's something in
the west. I'm sure of it.

192
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:27,752
Oh, well.

193
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,839
If you say so.

194
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,924
You <i>are</i> the vice-captain, after all.

195
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,385
So, will that be all?

196
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,178
Er, yup!

197
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:41,432
We'll take turns to keep watch,
so get some sleep in the meantime...

198
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,437
You sleep, too.

199
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,398
I'll take the first watch.

200
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,109
Oh, okay...

201
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:06,416
Looks like someone has trouble sleeping.

202
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:09,169
Shall I put you to sleep personally?

203
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,754
H-how did you know?

204
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,589
Intuition.

205
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,382
How scary!

206
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,475
Erm... could I ask you something?

207
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,227
What is it?

208
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,190
Why did you make me vice-captain?

209
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:30,899
What?!

210
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,403
I mean, compared to the others,
I'm quite average...

211
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:39,157
and there's nothing
about me that stands out.

212
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,744
In other words, you
don't think you're qualified?

213
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,623
With you running such a tight ship,

214
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:52,587
all that's left for me to do is
write reports and file applications.

215
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:55,297
It's all menial tasks.

216
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,884
Someone has to do them.

217
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,595
The fact that there haven't
been any complaints or mistakes

218
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,888
means that you've been doing a good job.

219
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,392
That's because...
I've been working really hard...

220
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:10,647
Keep that up and I just might
make you captain one day.

221
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,482
Huh? Captain?!

222
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,442
I've become battalion commander.

223
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:18,029
I can't keep being the
captain of this squad forever.

224
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,866
Eventually, you'll take
over my position as captain.

225
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,556
No, no, no, no, no way!

226
00:12:23,557 --> 00:12:26,912
If I become captain,
we'll all end up killing each other!

227
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,707
I'll be the first to get beaten up!

228
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,793
You don't think highly of them, do you?

229
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,504
Whatever the case, no means no!

230
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,715
I don't want you to leave! Ever!

231
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,805
As you're well aware, I'm stubborn.

232
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,351
I never follow orders I don't agree with.

233
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:50,603
I always do what I think is right,

234
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:53,064
even if everyone around me disagrees.

235
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,317
I know that.

236
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,695
No one can make me obey.

237
00:12:59,405 --> 00:13:03,533
If anyone has a problem with me,
I'll shut them up with force.

238
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:06,786
That's my policy as a knight.

239
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,039
Yeah. You were pretty famous.

240
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,208
Everyone was talking about
a knight who had the skills

241
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,004
but would not obey anyone,
not even a general.

242
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,636
That was when you came into my life.

243
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:28,599
I was planning on doing the same
and ignoring your orders.

244
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,727
But...

245
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:36,149
nothing I tried before
seemed to work with you.

246
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,027
When I disobeyed,
you knocked sense into me.

247
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,611
When I tried to run,

248
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,364
you ran all the way out of
the kingdom to bring me back.

249
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,033
When I tried to attack you,

250
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:48,966
you punched me so hard that I
couldn't remember anything after.

251
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,623
I don't think I hit you <i>that</i> hard.

252
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,626
What a funny joke!

253
00:13:56,522 --> 00:14:01,360
At that time, I decided that I
was never going to give in to you.

254
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:06,608
I would endure your hellish training
and show you up.

255
00:14:06,608 --> 00:14:08,639
I'm a sore loser, after all.

256
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,044
That's right.

257
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:13,019
I remember you suddenly
becoming all motivated.

258
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,813
I don't remember treating you
any differently, though.

259
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,816
Maybe not for you.

260
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,402
But to me... you were the first.

261
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,821
You didn't cast me out

262
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,032
and didn't turn away.

263
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,578
Others would get tired and give up on me.

264
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,914
You kept facing me head-on.

265
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,750
You were so annoying.

266
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,627
But... I was happy.

267
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:44,634
The others probably feel the same way.

268
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:48,971
No one else understands us like you do.

269
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,889
That is why...

270
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,433
no one else can be our captain but you.

271
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,441
Quit being a baby!

272
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,694
You need to stop relying
on mommy and grow up!

273
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,240
<i>That's</i> your response
to my heartfelt confession?

274
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,450
...n, nothing less from you.

275
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,663
You said that no one else
understands you guys like I do?

276
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,123
I-I did.

277
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:19,544
Do you think I'd pick someone
unqualified to replace me?

278
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,797
But... I mean...

279
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,467
I didn't make you vice-captain
on a whim, either.

280
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,344
I did so with confidence.

281
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,262
Excuse me?!

282
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:34,267
You never hesitate once
you've made up your mind.

283
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,895
You are able to stand strong
regardless of the situation.

284
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:42,775
That's going to become invaluable
moral support for those around you.

285
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:50,116
Just be yourself, and people
are going to follow you.

286
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:53,578
They... are?

287
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,708
Why do I have to spell it out for you?

288
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:01,294
I would never have known!

289
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:05,047
You seem to be really happy, though.

290
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,800
Want another of these?

291
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,051
N-no, thank you!

292
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,638
Listen up, Owl.

293
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,932
Nothing remains static forever.

294
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:17,727
Everything changes eventually.

295
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,397
We need to accept change to move forward.

296
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:27,945
However, nothing will change
the fact that I was your captain.

297
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,116
No need to worry yourself sick over it.

298
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,160
Okay.

299
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:38,119
Now then, it's time for
someone else to take over.

300
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,207
I'm gonna sleep.

301
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,604
All right.

302
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:42,044
I'll take the next watch.

303
00:16:42,277 --> 00:16:43,277
Thanks.

304
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,798
Hey! You guys better get some shut-eye!

305
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,134
"You guys"?

306
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,138
Vice-Captain! I trust you!

307
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,724
I don't hate you, okay?

308
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,684
Y-you guys...

309
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,229
It's not like any of us hates you.

310
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:04,065
We listen to your orders
when it counts, don't we?

311
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,360
You worry too much, great Vice-Captain!

312
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,990
That's not something you
should say while snickering!

313
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,617
Come here, you!!!

314
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,746
I'm going to make mincemeat
out of you guys before those demons!

315
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,332
Wait up!

316
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,594
Captain!

317
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:37,223
The claw marks from Glow Wolves.

318
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,893
Here, we have footprints
and fresh bloodstains.

319
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,772
It looks like the demons
<i>are</i> hunting monsters.

320
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,732
But why?

321
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,219
Why come into human territory...

322
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,903
to hunt monsters?

323
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,863
For pleasure?

324
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,533
That's too obvious.

325
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:58,953
There must be a deeper reason behind it.

326
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,002
Get ready for battle! Let's go!

327
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,717
Feisty one.

328
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,135
Pack it up.

329
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,695
They finally tracked us down.

330
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,586
Don't make a move yet.

331
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,587
Understood.

332
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,886
What are you doing on our land?

333
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,765
You demons putting together
a circus or something?

334
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,939
I don't like this mission, either.

335
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,402
But if it benefits us in the long run...

336
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,195
I have to do it regardless.

337
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:17,323
What is this "mission" of yours?

338
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,492
Like I'd tell you.

339
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:21,452
Be that way.

340
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:23,079
What now?

341
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,374
You still can avoid a fight.

342
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,876
Just leave, and we'll pretend
this never happened.

343
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,087
What arrogance...

344
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:34,548
but you seem to have
the strength to back it up.

345
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:39,762
Unfortunately, I can't let you live
now that you've seen us.

346
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,056
All of you will die here.

347
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:48,145
Owl, you're in charge.

348
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:48,521
Huh?

349
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,483
I can't lead while taking this guy on.

350
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,734
I'm counting on you.

351
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,570
Yes ma'am!

352
00:19:57,571 --> 00:20:00,241
It's either you or me.

353
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:01,367
Only one of us will come out alive.

354
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:05,162
Come and kill me... if you can!

355
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,002
Come on! Let's show these
demons our teamwork!

356
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,884
Wind! Become my legs, become my shield!

357
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,055
Let my body become an unstoppable blade!

358
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,473
An armor of wind?

359
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,442
No mere human could react that--

360
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:36,026
You talk too much!

361
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,487
Take this!

362
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,997
<i>That didn't do much damage.</i>

363
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:52,626
<i>He shielded himself with
wind at the last minute.</i>

364
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,465
<i>I'm leaving those guys to you.</i>

365
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,598
What a sneaky way to fight!

366
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,767
Found you!

367
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,614
I've never met a human
as strong as you before.

368
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,824
You're my enemy,
but I have to say I'm impressed.

369
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:09,411
You can talk all you want
after I've kicked your ass!

370
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,127
<i>He's surrounded me with blades of wind.</i>

371
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,754
<i>But...</i>

372
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,634
You think you have me trapped?

373
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:28,138
She's willing to injure herself to escape?

374
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,144
W-what's this?

375
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,521
Don't tell me...

376
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,731
your magic is...

377
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,362
I get it now.

378
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,364
You're a healer.

379
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,950
Your unadulterated physical strength

380
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,035
and unparalleled healing speed

381
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:51,954
make you a one-man army.

382
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:55,165
What a monster.

383
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:05,676
My name is Nero Arjence. What's yours?

384
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,845
It's Rose.

385
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,346
I see.

386
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:10,514
Rose, huh?

387
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,397
I will kill you here.

388
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,527
Not before I've beat the crap out of you.
