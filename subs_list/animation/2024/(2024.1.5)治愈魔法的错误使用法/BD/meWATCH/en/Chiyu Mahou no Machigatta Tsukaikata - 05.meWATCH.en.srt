1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,342
Why do I have to join
Inukami-senpai's training?

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:12,513
Kazuki had Siglis-san, didn't he?

3
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,641
You were supposed to
join Hero Kazuki, too.

4
00:00:15,642 --> 00:00:18,894
But you had just returned
from the forest, so I refused.

5
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,397
Then, Lloyd-sama sent
another request yesterday.

6
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:24,816
I couldn't refuse him twice, could I?

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:25,817
Right...

8
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,905
Relax. You're only there just
in case they need a healer.

9
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,533
Play your part for three
days and come home.

10
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:34,535
Okay...

11
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,330
Color me surprised!

12
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:41,124
To think that you'd be coming with us!

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,294
And with Blurin, too?!

14
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,587
Wait! I know what this is!

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,507
You're going to help us bond, aren't you?

16
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:53,428
No, Blurin doesn't like anyone
else, so I have to take him along.

17
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:57,349
Once again, you don't know
how to play along, do you?

18
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:58,809
Excuse me?

19
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,977
Nothing!

20
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:02,354
Oh, the introductions!

21
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:04,773
They'll be coming with us, too!

22
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,026
Aruku the knight and Korin the mage!

23
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,278
The pleasure's mine!

24
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,697
Pleased to make your acquaintance!

25
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:12,614
Likewise!

26
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:14,074
It's great to meet you!

27
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,287
Wait, haven't we met before?

28
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:21,123
We have! I'm usually
standing by the gate.

29
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:22,666
Oh, that's right!

30
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,959
Hero Suzune.

31
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,586
Y-yes?

32
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:29,172
Usato's healing magic isn't omnipotent.

33
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:31,383
It can heal wounds and cure poison,

34
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,133
but it can't bring people
back from the dead.

35
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,054
Don't take it for granted.

36
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:38,390
Understood.

37
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,852
Well, seeing that you
were trained by Siglis,

38
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:44,354
you should be able to
hold your own just fine.

39
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,360
I've got nothing to say to you.

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,487
What?

41
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,656
Not satisfied?

42
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,742
N-no! I'm good!

43
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,702
<i>Not like you have anything
nice to say to me anyway!</i>

44
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,454
Then, get going.

45
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:08,253
She's really strong, isn't she?

46
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,339
Huh? What do you mean by that?

47
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,257
Never mind.

48
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:14,259
Now, off we go! Off we go!

Kazuki-sama!

70
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,193
What are you doing?!

71
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,613
Practicing my sword strikes?

72
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,074
Well, I can see that.

73
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,743
But I received word that
you were all fatigued

74
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:06,037
after returning from
training yesterday.

75
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,165
And you're practicing already?

76
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,835
I had a good night's rest.

77
00:04:11,836 --> 00:04:14,004
I'm as right as rain, Celia-san.

78
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,048
Are you certain?

79
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,842
Are you not pushing yourself too hard?

80
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,469
I'm not.

81
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,762
See? Check this out!

82
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:26,641
V-very well.

83
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:28,977
But please, do keep your
own well-being in mind.

84
00:04:33,377 --> 00:04:36,902
Oh? Kazuki was <i>that</i> worn out, huh?

85
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:41,198
Yup. But he said that the
experience was worth it.

86
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,369
He battled a ton of monsters in a
clearing by the Darkness of Llinger.

87
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,039
That's exactly what we're going to do now.

88
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,334
<i>The Darkness of Llinger, huh?</i>

89
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,221
<i>I wonder if Blurin misses his home.</i>

90
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:08,475
By the way, Usato-kun. Is Blurin
gonna wake up any time soon?

91
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:09,643
Excuse me?

92
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,187
Seeing that he's asleep...

93
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,190
he wouldn't mind if I petted him, right?

94
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,982
What?!

95
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,693
He wouldn't, right?
Just a little, just a little!

96
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,157
What are you doing, Usato-kun?!

97
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,910
No, that's <i>my</i> line...

98
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,370
what are <i>you</i> doing?

99
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,082
Smacking a girl and talking down to her?

100
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,209
Have you become a
sadist or something?

101
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:36,086
I have no idea what you're going on about.

102
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,174
Oh, Blurin, you awake?

103
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,429
You can walk by yourself now, right?

104
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,563
Hey, are you all right?

105
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:55,647
Now's my chance!

106
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,234
I'll carry you, Blurin!

107
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:00,318
Come on, hop on!

108
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,654
Wait, Senpai! I don't think that's...

109
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,909
I-I did it!

110
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,327
He's so fluffy!

111
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,705
This is Blurin's...

112
00:06:11,706 --> 00:06:13,707
warmth...

113
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,293
S-Senpai!

114
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:24,050
Jeez... don't go hurting
yourself outside of battle.

115
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,597
Sorry, Usato-kun... and
thanks for healing me.

116
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,516
Now, <i>that</i> I'm fine with.

117
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:35,562
Multiple entities detected ahead!

118
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,564
Don't move, the two of you!

119
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:39,816
Monsters?

120
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,403
No, they're...

121
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,322
Damn.

122
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,449
Looks like they noticed us.

123
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:51,369
Right when we were plannin'
on ambushin' the lot of you.

124
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:58,919
What do we have here?
A palace knight and mage?

125
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,254
Hand over yer valuables!

126
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,339
We refuse!

127
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,007
Huh? Ya sure about that?

128
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:06,426
We clearly outnumber ya guys.

129
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,597
<i>Who are these guys? Bandits?</i>

130
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:12,515
<i>They're not intimidating at all.</i>

131
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,392
Usato-kun!

132
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,729
These guys aren't a threat at all, Senpai.

133
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:20,023
Real live bandits!

134
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:23,109
I've never seen one before!
They really <i>do</i> exist!

135
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,403
Senpai. You never fail to amaze me.

136
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:33,495
H-hot dang! These guys got
themselves a Blue Grizzly!

137
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,835
N-no! Look closer! It's just a cub!
It ain't nothin' to fear!

138
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,756
Y-yeah! Let's catch it and skin it alive!

139
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,342
You fiends!

140
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,427
Not on my watch!

141
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,474
T-thank goodness, he's alive!

142
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:58,478
That was amazing! Perfect control, too!

143
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,065
I know, right? I practiced a lot!

144
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,611
Alright, Senpai, go wild!

145
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:08,780
I'll heal them if I have to.

146
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,907
Me? Go wild?

147
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:15,328
That magic won't hit if we get close!
Everyone, charge!

148
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,958
Go, Senpai! Thunderbolt!

149
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,336
Just what do you take me for?!

150
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,718
Go, human stun gun!
No, human electric eel!

151
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:32,345
I'm going to get mad if you don't stop!

152
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,140
That just ain't fair!

153
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,142
Then, stop what you're doing!

154
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,061
I've detected something else.
They're fast.

155
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,271
What?!

156
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,113
Fall Boars?!

157
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,323
But they live much deeper in!

158
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,663
Thanks, Blurin!

159
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:03,793
Senpai!

160
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,090
U-Usato-kun!

161
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,634
It's all right! Just hold on tight!

162
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,527
Senpai, are you okay?! Senpai?!

163
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,573
<i>Wait, this river!</i>

164
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,284
<i>I fell into it before!</i>

165
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,244
<i>That means...</i>

166
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,997
<i>there's a waterfall ahead!</i>

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,501
Senpai... take a deep breath!

168
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:45,710
Got it!

169
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:56,054
Usato-kun! Usato-kun!

170
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:57,639
Don't quit on me now!

171
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,853
I'm going to get you somewhere safe!

172
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,814
I'll protect you!

173
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:09,692
This gal's not going to
let a debt go unpaid!

174
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,824
Inukami-senpai... I'm fine.

175
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,700
...and you're kinda embarrassing me.

176
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:25,583
Y-you're awake already?

177
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:30,004
I was just taking a breather after
pulling you out of the water...

178
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,633
Anyway, let's get that cut
on your face healed up.

179
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:43,142
T-thank you. Sorry it had
to come to this, Usato-kun.

180
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,730
Don't apologize. I'm glad
we got stranded together.

181
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:53,695
Still, I never thought I'd be
back here again so soon...

182
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:59,409
The captain dumped me into
this forest to train before.

183
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:02,495
It's teeming with monsters that
put those Fall Boars to shame.

184
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,378
No food, huh?

185
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,214
I wished we had enough to
last us at least one night.

186
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:16,759
Usato-kun, if this forest is
as dangerous as you say it is,

187
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,346
shouldn't we prioritize escaping it?

188
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:24,851
It's going to get dark soon,
and it might start raining.

189
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:27,729
Let's find a safe spot
to camp for the night

190
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,273
and find our way out tomorrow morning.

191
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,816
You have a point.

192
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,194
But where's safe?

193
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:40,033
I slept on a tree branch.
Is that all right with you?

194
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,119
I've never climbed a tree before...

195
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:47,540
I've always wanted to,
but I was never allowed to.

196
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:53,254
<i>Did she come from a rich family
that sheltered her all her life?</i>

197
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,174
<i>I guess it adds up...</i>

198
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,178
Let's camp there, then.

199
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,640
We'll be sheltered from the rain,

200
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,184
and it's way better than
going deeper into the forest.

201
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,604
That makes sense.

202
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,522
Now that that's settled...

203
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,734
you should get out of those wet clothes.

204
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,153
Don't mind if I do.

205
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,328
You won't peek, will you?

206
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:26,329
Peek?

207
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:29,082
You haven't even considered it?!

208
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,920
Are you ready, Usato-kun?

209
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,048
Yup! Feel free to start zapping away!

210
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,677
Zapping? That doesn't sound cool at all!

211
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,136
Here I go!

212
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:47,058
Wow! That's amazing!

213
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,394
That's dinner in the bag, Senpai!

214
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,397
...and now, fire! If you'd please.

215
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,315
Just leave it to me!

216
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:58,736
It's really fire!

217
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:02,407
I'm so glad to have you around, Senpai!

218
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,576
Aw, shucks, you're making me blush!

219
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,913
It's nice and warm!

220
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,041
I'll never take fire
for granted ever again!

221
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,631
Sorry, Senpai. I didn't mean to
make things awkward for you.

222
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,967
No, no! Don't mind me!

223
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,182
He's even more ripped than before!

224
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,018
Huh? Did you say something?

225
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,436
N-nothing!

226
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,824
Venom Monkeys!

227
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:45,992
You know them?

228
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,328
I've only read about them.

229
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,955
This is the first time
I see them in person.

230
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,917
O-one's heading this way!

231
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,253
They shouldn't be <i>that</i> aggressive...

232
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,921
But they <i>are</i> venomous,

233
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,381
so, no touching, okay?

234
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:01,758
Come on, don't be afraid!

235
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:05,219
What are you doing?!
After what I just said?!

236
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,241
If I get poisoned, then so be it!

237
00:14:07,242 --> 00:14:09,994
I'm already poisoned by their cuteness!

238
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,435
It's the price I have to pay.

239
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,938
See? Nothing to fear.

240
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,123
What did I tell you?!

241
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,694
They're missing?!

242
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,654
What is the meaning of this?

243
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,324
We just got word
from Korin's familiar.

244
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:29,327
They ran into a herd of monsters

245
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,205
and Suzune and Usato got separated.

246
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,543
I hesitated to tell you,

247
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:42,799
but Celia was adamant
about not keeping any secrets.

248
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,552
Has a search party been dispatched?

249
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,555
One is being assembled
as we speak. Tomorrow--

250
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,432
Tomorrow will be too late!

251
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,017
I'll head out at once.

252
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,352
Kazuki-sama!

253
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,397
Don't get ahead of yourself, Hero Kazuki.

254
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,024
You!

255
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,154
Hero Suzune and Usato are
probably stranded together.

256
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,115
In that case, there is
nothing to worry about.

257
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,535
Usato is my subordinate.

258
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:11,994
He's not going to die so easily.

259
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:16,124
And if Usato is fine, so is Hero Suzune.

260
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,377
That was delicious!

261
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,173
Man, with you here, surviving
in the wilderness is a breeze!

262
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:29,303
Are you treating me like some
kind of camping equipment?

263
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,931
Not at all!

264
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,059
I really <i>am</i> grateful!

265
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,603
Fine... I'll leave it at that.

266
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,401
Let's take turns sleeping.

267
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,610
You first.

268
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,323
N-no, I bet you're tired from
using all that healing magic.

269
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,616
You first!

270
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,826
You sure?

271
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,621
Well, if you say so...

272
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,311
Usato-kun...

273
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,772
Are you asleep?

274
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,610
No, I'm still awake.

275
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,737
Something on your mind?

276
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:36,204
How... do you feel about being
summoned to this world?

277
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,582
How I feel?

278
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,501
Do you want to go home?

279
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,088
That's a tough one.

280
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,383
I want to go home. But I
also have a reason to stay.

281
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,845
I don't want to go back.

282
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,850
Not going to ask why?

283
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,394
You want me to?

284
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,688
I do.

285
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:08,402
I think I already know why
you don't want to go back.

286
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,198
It's because you prefer
this world over ours.

287
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,658
Isn't that right?

288
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,492
Yeah.

289
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:20,122
There's nothing left in our world for me.

290
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:24,106
My family, my friends, who I was before...

291
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:27,295
I'll throw them all away to stay here.

292
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,590
I've been waiting for this all my life...

293
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:33,761
a chance... to free myself.

294
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,600
There's nothing tying
me down in this world.

295
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,396
That's a freedom that
I'll trade everything for.

296
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,733
Sounds good to me.

297
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,028
What's with that face?

298
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,196
I mean...

299
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,992
aren't you disappointed
by who I really am?

300
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:59,412
I've always wanted to change.

301
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:04,834
Back home, I was tired of my
ordinary life and my passive self.

302
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:08,754
We're not so different, you and I.

303
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,382
Usato-kun.

304
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:18,097
When I first arrived, I just didn't
want to hold you guys back.

305
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,394
But now, I'm determined
to protect you, Kazuki,

306
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:27,733
and the people of this kingdom
as a member of the Rescue Squad.

307
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:32,028
What about you?

308
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,197
Me, too.

309
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,657
I want to protect this place...

310
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,202
as a Hero!

311
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,834
All right! Let's save the people
of Llinger Kingdom together!

312
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,754
Forget our previous world.

313
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:52,757
Let's just protect our here and now.

314
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:58,095
You've really grown,
haven't you, Usato-kun?

315
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:01,966
...and you're much more relatable now.

316
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,436
Back in our world, I thought you
were flawless... the perfect girl!

317
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:06,771
Are you serious?

318
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:10,024
You've been treating your "perfect
girl" rather curtly, you know?

319
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,109
You think?

320
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,111
Not that I mind.

321
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:18,616
I'd rather be close to you
than be admired from afar.

322
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,379
I'm going to bed. Good night!

323
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,132
Did I get you all flustered?

324
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,556
I'm glad we had that chat.

325
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,433
Good night, Usato-kun.

326
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,735
I <i>think</i> we're heading
in the right direction.

327
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:57,655
Let's just keep an eye out for monsters.

328
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,075
Got it. I'll get ready to take them on.

329
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,584
Usato-kun!

330
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,545
Right!

331
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,929
Oh! Blurin!

332
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:26,058
Wait! I need to brace myself
before you jump on me!

333
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:38,904
S-Suzune-sama!

334
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,240
Usato... dono!

335
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,411
Aruku!

336
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,123
We were searching the forest perimeter

337
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:51,333
when that bear cub suddenly
started to run off on its own.

338
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:55,004
We thought it might lead us
to you, so we chased after it.

339
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,465
G-good job keeping up.

340
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,927
He must have picked up
your scent, Usato-kun!

341
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,554
Good job, Blurin!

342
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,353
Blurin?

343
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,485
Usato-kun? What is this place?

344
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:20,362
This was Blurin's home.

345
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,283
His parents were killed
by a giant snake monster.

346
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,494
I see...

347
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,164
Blurin.

348
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,714
Hey, Usato-kun!

349
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,840
What's this?

350
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,843
I think he wants to leave.

351
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,056
I think he's decided!

352
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:50,434
That by your side is
where he belongs!

353
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:56,232
Come!

354
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,694
Let's go home, Usato-kun!

355
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,324
Let's go home.

356
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,451
Back to where we belong.

357
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:15,670
<i>The beginning was sudden and silent.</i>

358
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:23,425
<i>Then, everything before
me began to change.</i>

359
00:22:35,315 --> 00:22:41,196
<i>Even the stones lying at my feet</i>

360
00:22:41,196 --> 00:22:47,410
<i>seem to shine a little brighter.</i>

361
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:56,920
<i>That's because you're reflected in them.</i>

362
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:02,300
<i>Like a young leaf that's just sprouted,</i>

363
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:08,262
<i>you're brimming with a translucent light.</i>

364
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:14,771
<i>Let the wind blow you onward.</i>

365
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:20,443
<i>If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.</i>

366
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:26,533
<i>Even if you're not special,
you can be anything.</i>

367
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:39,170
<i>Let me believe in the strength
that's awakened in your heart.</i>
