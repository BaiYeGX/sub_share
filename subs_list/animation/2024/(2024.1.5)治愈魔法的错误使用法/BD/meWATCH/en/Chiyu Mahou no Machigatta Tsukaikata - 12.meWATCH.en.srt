1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:04,004
Listen to this, Blurin... it was horrible!

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:09,384
We all got called to the castle
right after coming back from war.

3
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:13,805
Lloyd-sama talked about
some kind of award,

4
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:17,100
but I've never stood
before such a large crowd,

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:18,769
and I got really nervous!

6
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,813
I even got hit by the captain.

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,525
But to be honest, I was kinda happy.

8
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:30,822
Back in my old world,
I never got any kind of award.

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,116
Anyway...

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,995
Did you put on some weight
while I was away?

11
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,584
I mean, just look at this.

12
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,213
Oh, there yer are, Usato!

13
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:48,131
Gomul?! What's up?

14
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,904
Some guy from the castle.

15
00:00:50,905 --> 00:00:52,844
He says yer wanted.

16
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,096
Again?

17
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,305
What do they want now?

18
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,016
Whatever they want, better go quick.

19
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,601
He sounded urgent.

20
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,919
Oh, yeah.

21
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:04,523
Watch yerself when going through town.

22
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:06,233
What do you mean?

23
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,944
Yer'll see.

24
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,074
W-what's all this?

25
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,492
- It's the Rescue Squad guy!
- Er, everyone, please calm down!

26
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,994
- Thanks for saving my son!
- Er, everyone, please calm down!

27
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,453
Take these!

28
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:19,621
No, I couldn't!

29
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,790
Really, I can't carry them all!

30
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,042
Thank you very much!

31
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,294
No, I insist!

32
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,806
<i>The walls that tower over you</i>

33
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:52,478
<i>are just so tall and thick. </i>

34
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,940
<i>They're not there to overwhelm you.</i>

35
00:01:57,483 --> 00:02:01,403
<i>They're there for you to overcome.</i>

36
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,783
<i>That's what I believe.</i>

37
00:02:05,783 --> 00:02:07,868
<i>For thousands of nights</i>

38
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:10,245
<i>and tens of thousands of mornings,</i>

39
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:12,873
<i>I can keep trying</i>

40
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:14,667
<i>without losing my way.</i>

41
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:16,710
<i>As long as I can arrive</i>

42
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,046
<i>at the final chapter,</i>

43
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:22,883
<i>it's okay even if</i>

44
00:02:24,009 --> 00:02:25,135
<i>I'm scarred.</i>

45
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:27,763
<i>Stand! Up! Again!</i>

46
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:29,556
<i>Over and over!</i>

47
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:32,226
<i>Don't! Look! Back!</i>

48
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:35,479
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

49
00:02:36,646 --> 00:02:38,648
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

50
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,217
(#12 The Black Knight Unmasked!)

51
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,720
So, that's what happened.
(#12 The Black Knight Unmasked!)

52
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:00,305
Wouldn't have expected anything less.
(#12 The Black Knight Unmasked!)

53
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,683
Seriously, it took forever to escape!

54
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,937
After what you did on the battlefield?

55
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,355
I'm not surprised.

56
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,483
Once again, I'll say my thanks.

57
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,319
Thank you for saving my fellow knights.

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,822
Please raise your head!

59
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:20,241
They saved me many times
on the battlefield as well.

60
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,286
Aruku-san, you protected
the Rescue Squad, didn't you?

61
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,122
Let's call us even.

62
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:30,210
You're a funny one, aren't you?

63
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,796
If I need any more guarding,

64
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,256
you're my man.

65
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,384
Leave it to me!

66
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:39,594
Good eye, Usato-san!

67
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,389
Akuru-san is skilled in
both swordplay and magic!

68
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,475
He has what it takes to
become an imperial guard!

69
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,311
Quit it, Thomas!

70
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:50,521
But it's the truth!

71
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,649
Please support him whenever you can!

72
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:54,401
Of course, I will!

73
00:03:55,253 --> 00:03:57,195
T-thank you.

74
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,992
Thank you for coming all
the way here once again.

75
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,994
I am in need of your assistance.

76
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,788
Yes, how may I be of service?

77
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,707
Siglis.

78
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,332
Your Majesty.

79
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,627
We want you to assist us

80
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:16,882
in interrogating the
Black Knight you caught.

81
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,341
<i>Her?</i>

82
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:24,264
Did something happen?

83
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,808
Did she try to resist when questioned?

84
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:27,601
Not at all.

85
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,894
On the contrary,

86
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:32,396
it seems like she isn't
that loyal to the Demon Lord

87
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,399
and is willing to cooperate with us.

88
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,400
Then...

89
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,114
However, she has yet to divulge
any important information.

90
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,202
Information like the type of
magic her commander uses.

91
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,496
I see.

92
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:51,500
She's agreed to talk only if
we agree to her demands.

93
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,757
She wants to meet you, Usato-sama.

94
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,095
Relax, Usato-kun!

95
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,931
I'm here with you!

96
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,517
If anything happens, I'll protect you!

97
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,104
But the Black Knight's
behaving now, isn't she?

98
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,731
And besides...

99
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,566
she beat you.

100
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,610
Well, you have a point.

101
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:23,114
The only ones capable of
fighting her are you and Rose-san.

102
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,617
But... I could at least
act as your shield!

103
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,078
T-thanks for that...

104
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,083
But <i>why</i> exactly was I able to fight her?

105
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:37,587
The Black Knight wields dark magic.

106
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:42,217
Dark magic and healing
magic cancel each other out.

107
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,886
Right... they cancel each other out, huh?

108
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:46,930
Wait a minute.

109
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:54,104
That means the healing magic
I cloaked my fist with didn't work?

110
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,690
Yes, that's what it means.

111
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,902
Siglis-san, did anyone treat her?

112
00:06:01,904 --> 00:06:06,324
No, she put her black armor back on
ever since she regained consciousness.

113
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,118
This isn't good!

114
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,204
Hey!

115
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,333
You're hurt, aren't you?

116
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,002
And pretty badly at that.

117
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,005
It's you.

118
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:24,175
You took all my punches
head-on, didn't you?

119
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:28,054
I don't mean to brag,
but my punches can split boulders.

120
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,973
You should be in pretty bad shape.

121
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,311
Yeah, that's right.

122
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,604
But this is fine.

123
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,023
This is what pain feels like.

124
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:41,484
Usato-kun...

125
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,112
she's a masochist.

126
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,364
You keep your mouth shut.

127
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,995
You wanted to see me, right?

128
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,164
Why?

129
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:59,419
I wanted to meet the guy...

130
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,630
who put me in this pitiful state...

131
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,090
I suppose.

132
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:07,928
Siglis-san...

133
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:10,138
Let me in.

134
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,514
But...

135
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,099
Please.

136
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,434
I have to save her.

137
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,613
Give me your hand.

138
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,490
What's this? Torture?

139
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,575
Shut up and give me your hand!

140
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:35,997
W-what are you doing?

141
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,083
What else? I'm healing you.

142
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,335
I don't need it!

143
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,213
Let me go! Release me!

144
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,097
Your death will leave
a bad taste in my mouth.

145
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,640
Shut up and let me heal you.

146
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,602
What's this?

147
00:08:10,604 --> 00:08:12,117
It's... warm.

148
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,285
Usato-kun?

149
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:15,912
She's all right. I think.

150
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,583
All done.

151
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,587
Erm...

152
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,089
You can let go now...

153
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,008
Just a little bit more.

154
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,811
This is... a first for me.

155
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,690
Just stay like this for a little bit more.

156
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,823
How could I refuse a face like that?

157
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,205
Now, then.

158
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,625
It's been a while since
I trained you personally.

159
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,795
Er... how did it come to this?

160
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,007
I said this before, but the
Demon Lord's Army will attack again.

161
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:13,386
There are things you need
to learn before that happens.

162
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,846
That makes sense.

163
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,683
I guess I <i>do</i> need to
power up my healing magic.

164
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,186
I still can't heal diseases
or anything complicated.

165
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,813
We'll take things one step at a time.

166
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,774
That's beyond your current abilities.

167
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,069
So... more bodybuilding?

168
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:33,573
No, you're pretty much
almost there physically,

169
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,492
so we'll put that aside for now.

170
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,869
Then what?

171
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,663
Excuse me?

172
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,374
Captain?

173
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:48,545
I'm going to punch you now.

174
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:49,964
Sorry?

175
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:53,676
I'm going to punch you
faster than you can react.

176
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,552
Dodge them.

177
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,596
You hate me, don't you?!

178
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,099
I'm going to explode if
I take one of your punches!

179
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,143
You rely way too much on healing magic.

180
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,480
But that is how I trained you.

181
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,691
It's time for the next step.

182
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,861
No! Don't kill me!

183
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,198
You think you can heal
yourself if you get injured?

184
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:20,912
Healing magic doesn't
work on cursed wounds.

185
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,498
Learn how to dodge.

186
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,085
Well, even I'm not an ogre.

187
00:10:27,086 --> 00:10:28,378
I'll start soft.

188
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,504
I don't care how hard you punch!

189
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:31,131
You should not be punching
your subordinates at all!

190
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,715
Have you lost your...?!

191
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,926
I'm sorry!

192
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,846
You want me to punch
you will all my might?

193
00:10:37,847 --> 00:10:39,388
I'm more than happy to oblige.

194
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:41,975
I'm glad you're taking this seriously!

195
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,154
Don't you dare block my punch!

196
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,697
You're crazy!

197
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,672
What a nightmare.

198
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,841
I must have been training too hard.

199
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:18,011
No way was I being punched
as part of my training.

200
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,095
You awake?

201
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,889
Then, let's go again.

202
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:23,307
I'll stop running away from reality now.

203
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,019
Relax. I pulled my punch.

204
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,645
You're fine, aren't you?

205
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,274
Thank you so very much for that.

206
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,487
...and that went on for three days!

207
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,114
She's way too mean, right?

208
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,534
She increases the speed of her punches
whenever I'm about to avoid them.

209
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,164
Yesterday, the moment I started to focus
on dodging, she'd land a critical hit.

210
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:49,083
I think she's lost the point
of all this training, don't you?

211
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,502
You know...

212
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:54,005
all you do is talk whenever you come here.

213
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:55,798
What are you really up to?

214
00:11:55,798 --> 00:12:00,219
Nah, I don't have training today
because the captain's busy.

215
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,139
And I was wondering how you were doing.

216
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,558
You can see for yourself, can't you?

217
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,685
So, what do you plan to do?

218
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:12,774
Why bother asking when it's not up to me?

219
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,443
Well... I guess not.

220
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:18,363
Why do you...

221
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:18,905
Yeah?

222
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,533
Nothing.

223
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,453
Get lost.

224
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,414
All right, all right. If you say so.

225
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:37,715
Lloyd-sama...

226
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:39,801
you called?

227
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,804
Thanks for coming, Rose.

228
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,724
I have two things
I'd like to entrust you with.

229
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,601
Anything, Your Majesty.

230
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,288
My, if it isn't Usato-sama!

231
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:10,123
Afternoon, Celia-sama!

232
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,500
Kazuki's up to something new, isn't he?

233
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,334
Indeed.

234
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:17,755
He's been wanting to improve his magic
ever since he came back from battle.

235
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,801
Every now and then, I tell him
not to push himself too hard...

236
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,802
<i>Wait a minute...</i>

237
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,597
<i>Is</i> that <i>how training was supposed to go?</i>

238
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:32,562
Usato-sama, that's
a scary face you're making.

239
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:35,398
Usato!

240
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:42,697
That reminds me. I heard from Senpai
that you made the Black Knight cry?

241
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:45,199
I didn't do anything weird, promise!

242
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,243
I just healed her wounds.

243
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,912
I know. I was just teasing you.

244
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,539
Give me a break...

245
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:54,955
Suzune-sama also said something else.

246
00:13:54,956 --> 00:13:59,588
Something about triggering
the Black Knight's flag?

247
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,218
Celia-sama... please don't
listen to anything that girl says.

248
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,470
Right...

249
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:11,267
Seems like they were able to get
all the important information out of her.

250
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,603
Father is really grateful.

251
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,605
Oh, that's great!

252
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,108
You've made yourself even
more trustworthy in his eyes.

253
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:26,366
He even said that we might have
lost the battle if it wasn't for you.

254
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,159
No, that's not true at all.

255
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,911
Oh, yes it is!

256
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,997
If it weren't for you. I would have...

257
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,103
Er, I mean...

258
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,170
N-nothing! I should get back to training.

259
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,714
See ya!

260
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,800
I'll go visit you again!

261
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,426
Do take care!

262
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,638
Now then, back to training.

263
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:55,478
Before that, mind if I asked what
you were about to say just now?

264
00:14:56,396 --> 00:15:01,818
What would have happened if you
weren't saved by Usato-sama?

265
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,278
Er... what was it again?

266
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,988
Yes?

267
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,617
M-my apologies!

268
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:14,497
<i>Kazuki... you didn't tell her you were
almost killed by the Black Knight?</i>

269
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,419
<i>Now that I think about it...
what's going to happen to her?</i>

270
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,337
<i>They've already gotten all
the information out of her...</i>

271
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,425
<i>they're not going to
execute her, right?</i>

272
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,596
<i>That Usato guy...</i>

273
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,266
<i>what was he up to?</i>

274
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,143
<i>Why did he come all the way to see me?</i>

275
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:37,812
<i>Usato?</i>

276
00:15:42,786 --> 00:15:43,776
<i>That's not him.</i>

277
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,279
Hey, there!

278
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:49,991
<i>The same outfit as Usato's.</i>

279
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,409
<i>The captain he spoke of?</i>

280
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,215
This is the first time
I've seen you awake.

281
00:15:55,216 --> 00:16:00,710
I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't for Lloyd-sama.

282
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,044
What do you want?

283
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,464
You have two choices.

284
00:16:06,151 --> 00:16:10,133
One is to live here forever.

285
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:11,929
The other...

286
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,598
If you want to kill me, go ahead.

287
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,308
Don't get ahead of yourself.

288
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,018
Impatient, aren't you?

289
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:26,630
The other option involves
a <i>ton</i> of work for me.

290
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,199
It's for me to beat some sense into you
and turn you into a decent human,

291
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,534
nay, a decent demon.

292
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,995
What? Cut the bull--

293
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,082
Huh.

294
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,627
Healing magic <i>does</i> work.

295
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,048
Lloyd-sama isn't fond
of killing his captives...

296
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:50,218
even problematic ones like you.

297
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,057
He even understands the bond demons share.

298
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,810
Killing you will just
make the others angry.

299
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,481
Nothing's more troublesome than
those obsessed with revenge.

300
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,368
My magic?!

301
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,328
That's a magical tool that seals magic.

302
00:17:17,505 --> 00:17:18,496
What?!

303
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:21,832
These are rare! You're wasting one on me?!

304
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,836
I'm fine with leaving you here to rot,

305
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:28,839
but the people of our kingdom are
too busy to keep watch over you.

306
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,134
Which means... decent demon it is.

307
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,554
Wait! Wasn't that supposed to be up to me?

308
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,806
Lloyd-sama left you in my care.

309
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:39,684
What happens to you is up to me.

310
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,396
No! What are you going to do to me?!

311
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,690
You have no right to refuse!

312
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:55,074
That's it, Blurin!

313
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,119
At that pace, you'll lose
those pounds in no time!

314
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,663
All right, one more lap!

315
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,583
I told you to rest, didn't I?

316
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,669
Sorry, I just couldn't keep still.

317
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,213
Wait, you kicked me for <i>that</i>?

318
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,465
Who's that?

319
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,509
Oh, her?

320
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,222
Huh? Isn't that...?

321
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,223
Shut up!

322
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:20,433
What was that for?

323
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,769
W-why'd you bring her here?

324
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:28,691
I'll be beating some sense into her
as the Rescue Squad's newest recruit.

325
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,402
Training a demon... what fun!

326
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,362
B-b-but still!

327
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,824
I've sealed away her magic,
so she won't try anything weird.

328
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,076
On top of that,

329
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:42,496
I'll be training her personally.

330
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,874
Just like how I trained you.

331
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,584
You can't be serious!

332
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,133
Where am I...

333
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:56,802
Usato?

334
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,305
My condolences.

335
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:00,930
Come again?

336
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,604
Enter.

337
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,774
Pardon me.

338
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:13,818
How's she holding up?

339
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,572
Lots of complaints...

340
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:19,241
but she calmed down after taking a bath.

341
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,411
She's sleeping in her room now.

342
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,746
Good to hear.

343
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:29,919
Looks like she still doesn't
know what she's in for.

344
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,339
Oh, well. She will once we start training.

345
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,174
I'll bet.

346
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,343
Also, you were looking for me?

347
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,219
Right.

348
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:41,889
I had a talk with Lloyd-sama today.

349
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,810
This concerns you, too.

350
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,313
Rose.

351
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:55,152
In order to fight the Demon Lord's Army,
I plan to seek the aid of other countries.

352
00:19:56,821 --> 00:20:01,409
I'll be sending envoys to
those countries bearing letters.

353
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,330
A journey to deliver letters?

354
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,706
Exactly.

355
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:14,004
Those Lloyd-sama chose to be envoys are
Hero Kazuki, Hero Suzune, and...

356
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,256
Usato, you.

357
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:22,179
I get why he'd choose Senpai
and Kazuki... but why me?

358
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,472
It's obvious, isn't it?

359
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,891
With the fate of the kingdom on the line,

360
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:29,854
he trusts that you'll be able
to accomplish this mission.

361
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,314
And so do I.

362
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:35,735
You have some time before you leave.

363
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,986
Make sure to get yourself ready.

364
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:38,863
I will!

365
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,117
Coming right up!

366
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:43,951
Here you go.

367
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,494
Thanks a ton!

368
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,164
Excuse me, Usato-san?

369
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,292
Good luck with your Rescue Squad duties!

370
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,502
We just wanted to tell you that!

371
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,712
T-thanks.

372
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,592
Sorry about last time.

373
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:02,094
We got a little bit too carried away.

374
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,388
It won't happen again.

375
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,015
Right...

376
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,812
<i>The people of this kingdom are so kind.</i>

377
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:17,485
<i>Going on that mission will
also help protect these people.</i>

378
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,403
Oh, if it isn't Usato-kun!

379
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:22,281
Senpai.

380
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,617
Fancy meeting you here.

381
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,826
My, my...

382
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,496
This must be what they call fate!

383
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,291
...meeting in the marketplace
isn't <i>that</i> big of a coincidence.

384
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:36,921
Can I take this as you triggering
yet another flag of mine?

385
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,008
Please start making sense.

386
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:45,782
The little fox!

387
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,806
I found her!

388
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,520
I finally got you!

389
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,231
Time for you to talk!

390
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,733
I've been waiting.

391
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,027
Now for you to pay me back.

392
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,822
Healer...

393
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,407
Please save...

394
00:22:05,988 --> 00:22:07,117
my mom.

395
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:15,792
<i>The beginning was sudden and silent.</i>

396
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:23,547
<i>Then, everything before
me began to change.</i>

397
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:41,318
<i>Even the stones lying at my feet</i>

398
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:47,532
<i>seem to shine a little brighter.</i>

399
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:57,042
<i>That's because you're reflected in them.</i>

400
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:02,422
<i>Like a young leaf that's just sprouted,</i>

401
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:08,384
<i>you're brimming with a translucent light.</i>

402
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:14,893
<i>Let the wind blow you onward.</i>

403
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:20,565
<i>If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.</i>

404
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:26,655
<i>Even if you're not special,
you can be anything.</i>

405
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:39,292
<i>Let me believe in the strength
that's awakened in your heart.</i>
