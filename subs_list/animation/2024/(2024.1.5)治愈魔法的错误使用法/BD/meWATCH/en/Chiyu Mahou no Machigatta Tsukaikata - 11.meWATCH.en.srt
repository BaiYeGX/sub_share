1
00:00:04,102 --> 00:00:06,924
K-Kazuki...-kun.

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:11,844
Attacks he can't perceive
aren't reflected right away.

3
00:00:11,845 --> 00:00:16,558
So, all we need to do is to make him
unable to say "reflect" with an attack.

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:17,976
Is that what you thought?

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:23,565
It has nothing to do with
my vision or my perception.

6
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:27,236
It's not automatic. <i>I</i> decide
what attacks to reflect.

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:31,990
I purposely didn't reflect
the attack on my back.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,118
I don't even need to say
"reflect" for it to work.

9
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,581
No one has ever injured me...

10
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,291
and no one ever will.

11
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:52,052
I had faith in the two of you...

12
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,679
but I guess not.

13
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,773
<i>Usato...-kun.</i>

14
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,817
<i>I'm... sorry.</i>

15
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:27,147
(The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic)

16
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:29,806
<i>The walls that tower over you</i>

17
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:34,478
<i>are just so tall and thick. </i>

18
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,940
<i>They're not there to overwhelm you.</i>

19
00:01:39,483 --> 00:01:43,403
<i>They're there for you to overcome.</i>

20
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,783
<i>That's what I believe.</i>

21
00:01:47,783 --> 00:01:49,868
<i>For thousands of nights</i>

22
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:52,245
<i>and tens of thousands of mornings,</i>

23
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:54,873
<i>I can keep trying</i>

24
00:01:54,873 --> 00:01:56,667
<i>without losing my way.</i>

25
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:58,710
<i>As long as I can arrive</i>

26
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,046
<i>at the final chapter,</i>

27
00:02:01,546 --> 00:02:04,883
<i>it's okay even if</i>

28
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:07,135
<i>I'm scarred.</i>

29
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:09,763
<i>Stand! Up! Again!</i>

30
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,556
<i>Over and over!</i>

31
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:14,226
<i>Don't! Look! Back!</i>

32
00:02:14,226 --> 00:02:17,479
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

33
00:02:18,646 --> 00:02:20,648
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

34
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:43,246
We managed to get those
school rules amended, didn't we?

35
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,915
Excellent job, Senpai.

36
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,794
No, it was thanks to your
materials, Kazuki-kun.

37
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,337
You really <i>are</i> dependable.

38
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,922
No, no.

39
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:54,675
Just from the teachers
you were talking with,

40
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:58,844
I could really see the respect and
expectations they had for you.

41
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,263
<i>That</i> is why we succeeded.

42
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,226
You think so?

43
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:04,935
Of course!

44
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,729
Oh, I'm sorry.

45
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,980
I'll go grab my bag.

46
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,607
Sure, I'll make my way down first.

47
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,071
Respect and expectations, huh?

48
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,619
It's not stopping!

49
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,623
Oh?

50
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,001
<i>I'm really glad...</i>

51
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,504
<i>I met you that day.</i>

52
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,383
<i>When I was summoned
to another world,</i>

53
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,592
<i>I was so happy.</i>

54
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,096
<i>I could finally be a new me.</i>

55
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,223
<i>That is all I could think about.</i>

56
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,227
<i>But... you were different.</i>

57
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:51,356
<i>You did everything you could
to prepare yourself</i>

58
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,109
<i>for living a new life in a new world.</i>

59
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,611
<i>You were so dazzling,</i>

60
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,572
<i>I could hardly look at you.</i>

61
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,783
<i>And on top of that,</i>

62
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,953
<i>when you accepted not the
old me that was just a facade...</i>

63
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:10,041
<i>but the real me I could
finally be in this new world...</i>

64
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,418
<i>I was really happy.</i>

65
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,255
<i>As long as I had you and
Kazuki-kun by my side,</i>

66
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,132
<i>everything would be all right.</i>

67
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,092
<i>...or so I thought.</i>

68
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,177
<i>However...</i>

69
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,892
Our Heroes!

70
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,019
Praise the Black Knight!

71
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,980
We did it!

72
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:41,740
Time to end this.

73
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,578
That was fun...

74
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,121
for a little while.

75
00:04:56,588 --> 00:05:02,636
No you don't!

76
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,643
Kazuki! Senpai!

77
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,771
<i>I didn't make it!</i>

78
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,234
No, I <i>did</i> make it!

79
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,621
U... sato... -kun...

80
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,166
Senpai!

81
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,800
That hurt!

82
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,928
What was that?

83
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,849
Who are you?!

84
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,775
Time to run!

85
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,529
Not on your life!

86
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,875
Senpai! You're all healed up?

87
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,210
Yeah! Thanks!

88
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,463
I'm just about done
healing Kazuki's wounds.

89
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,382
He should wake up soon.

90
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:26,303
I see... Listen to this, Usato-kun.

91
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,095
Incoming!

92
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,395
That was close!

93
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,858
Come on... I still have those
other knights to heal, you know?

94
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,068
Listen, Usato-kun.

95
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:46,364
Your attack on the Black Knight worked!

96
00:06:47,198 --> 00:06:48,783
What do you mean?

97
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,203
His armor is most likely made of magic.

98
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,916
It reflects all attacks
back on the attacker.

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,878
Are you serious? That's totally cheating.

100
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:03,298
But your punch worked!

101
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,383
What was that attack?

102
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,344
That attack?

103
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,348
I won't let you escape.

104
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,558
I don't know what that was,

105
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:18,396
but I'm going to have to
pay you back for that.

106
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:22,359
<i>I honestly don't want to fight.</i>

107
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,445
<i>But I can't save everyone with him around.</i>

108
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:26,988
<i>So be it!</i>

109
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,410
Usato-kun?

110
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,621
You two stay here.

111
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,207
I'll hold him off.

112
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,172
Come! To your death!

113
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,675
Careful, Usato-kun!

114
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,386
<i>Morphing at will?</i>

115
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:51,513
<i>But even if my
attacks are reflected,</i>

116
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,390
<i>I can heal myself!</i>

117
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,396
<i>My attacks aren't being reflected?</i>

118
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,522
<i>Is he out of mana?</i>

119
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,483
How?

120
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,110
<i>He's taken aback!</i>

121
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,403
<i>In that case...</i>

122
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,279
Take this!

123
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,744
Sorry! That was a feint!

124
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,418
Why you...

125
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,380
Die!!!

126
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,925
I'm not going to just
because you said so!

127
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,265
Usa...to.

128
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,517
Kazuki-kun, you're awake!

129
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,602
What happened?

130
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,981
Did Usato heal me?

131
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,985
He saved both of our lives.

132
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,194
And he's now...

133
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,906
fighting the Black Knight.

134
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,993
Oh, no!

135
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,662
Now what?

136
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,501
What's happening?

137
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,088
The Black Knight's attacks
aren't having any effect.

138
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:13,678
For some reason, Usato-kun's
attacks aren't being reflected.

139
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:19,726
Also, why is Usato cloaking
himself in healing magic?

140
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,978
He isn't healing his own
wounds or fatigue, right?

141
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,938
Yeah...

142
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,067
He's just healing the enemy
every time he lands a hit...

143
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,695
Don't tell me...

144
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:32,822
the Black Knight's weakness is...

145
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,449
healing magic?

146
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,123
Magic that activates
when the user is injured

147
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,210
 can't activate when the attack
is cloaked in healing magic.

148
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,921
That's because the injury
that should be reflected

149
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,173
has already been healed!

150
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,091
That means...

151
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,843
the only thing hurting
the Black Knight is...

152
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:57,013
nothing but...

153
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,681
Usato-kun's punches!

154
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,601
They don't leave any injuries,

155
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,019
but they hurt like hell!

156
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,484
That's so messed up!

157
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,823
That's...

158
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,993
That's the wrong way to use healing magic!

159
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:22,789
You're kidding me.

160
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,708
This can't be happening.

161
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,336
Not to me!

162
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:38,805
You..

163
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:41,724
I'll kill you!

164
00:10:41,869 --> 00:10:42,642
Usato!

165
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,310
Kazuki!

166
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,436
You're awake!

167
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,229
Thank goodness!

168
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,022
Usato-kun!

169
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,066
No need to worry!

170
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,028
I'll take him out in one more hit.

171
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:54,486
Take him out?

172
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,116
No matter what magic he uses,

173
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,827
it doesn't change what I have to do.

174
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,912
Make sure...

175
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:05,415
he doesn't hurt anyone else...

176
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,916
ever again!

177
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,486
I nailed it.

178
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,614
That was the killing move...

179
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,616
no, the winning move...

180
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,826
the healing punch.

181
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:32,710
There we go.

182
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:34,337
Everything's fine now.

183
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:35,797
Thank you so much.

184
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,799
Thank you for saving us.

185
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:38,800
Not at all.

186
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,513
It's all in a day's work
for the Rescue Squad.

187
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,682
Not just for healing us,

188
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:48,476
but for beating the Black Knight

189
00:12:48,477 --> 00:12:50,895
and for making the demons
lose their will to fight.

190
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,940
That's right, Usato-kun.

191
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,817
If you hadn't beaten the Black Knight,

192
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,819
there would have been
many more casualties.

193
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,822
I guess you're right.

194
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,281
I am indeed.

195
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,700
Good job to you, too.

196
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,201
You can go get some rest.

197
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,786
Thank you, ma'am. Right away.

198
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,249
Usato-kun,

199
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,334
you really saved the day.

200
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,544
You were amazing.

201
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,379
Nah...

202
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,025
So... about that healing punch?

203
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:20,675
You heard that?

204
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,886
That was a really interesting name.

205
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,847
What kind of move was that?

206
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,474
Well, it's not anything special.

207
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,644
It's just my fist
cloaked in healing magic.

208
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,104
That's all there is to it.

209
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:36,399
The captain taught it to me.

210
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:40,695
I've got a special technique
 for idiots like you.

211
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,616
Listen up because I'm only
going to say this once.

212
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:50,038
If you face an enemy you
have to defeat no matter what...

213
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:53,166
Punch 'em with a fist
full of healing magic.

214
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,085
Heal them as you hit them.

215
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,296
That way, you won't kill them.

216
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,922
You'll just knock them out.

217
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,677
Even without the damage, they'll
still feel the pain and impact.

218
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,139
With this, I can knock them out
without leaving any lasting injuries!

219
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,141
Amazing, isn't it?

220
00:14:10,402 --> 00:14:11,809
Y-yup.

221
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,187
You're corrupted, all right...

222
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,439
by Rose-san.

223
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,441
Stop that!

224
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,026
Please don't lump us together!

225
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,613
Well, to be fair...

226
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:28,993
it <i>is</i> a fact that that healing
punch saved the two of us.

227
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,620
You have my thanks.

228
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,209
No thanks necessary.

229
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,628
You're my precious senpai,

230
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,755
and Kazuki is my dear friend.

231
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,154
Senpai!

232
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:48,805
That snake monster has
moved to the front lines.

233
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:49,889
I see.

234
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,183
Then that's what we're fighting next.

235
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:53,017
Right!

236
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,811
Then I'll head to the
front lines with you guys.

237
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:56,687
Hey!

238
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,399
C-captain!

239
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,443
I heard that the Heroes
were on the verge of death.

240
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:04,487
What's going on?

241
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:05,988
Explain the situation.

242
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,825
W-well, you see...

243
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,745
Right... so that's the Black Knight.

244
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,707
To think that you'd be the one
to put an end to everything.

245
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,917
I'm sorry...

246
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,710
Don't be.

247
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,797
Healing the Heroes, capturing
a powerful enemy combatant,

248
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,674
and sending their forces into disarray.

249
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,426
Now's a good time.

250
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,138
We're heading back to camp.

251
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:31,013
Excuse me?

252
00:15:31,222 --> 00:15:33,474
The battle has swung heavily in our favor.

253
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,185
As long as they don't have
anything up their sleeve,

254
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,895
we've got this in the bag.

255
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,107
We're just going to get in the way.

256
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,529
Kazuki, Senpai!

257
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,823
I'm heading back with the captain.

258
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:49,907
I see...

259
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,492
Thanks for the heads up.

260
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,578
I can't thank you enough, Usato.

261
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,080
Don't die on me now.

262
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,293
You guys are the Heroes!
Go kick their butts!

263
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,502
You got it.

264
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,797
I'm not going to waste
the life you gave me.

265
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:06,298
Usato.

266
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:10,636
See ya!

267
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,685
Good job staying alive.

268
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,188
Sorry, did you say something?

269
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,689
Nothing. Let's book it.

270
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,399
Right behind you!

271
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,271
The Black Knight... got captured?

272
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:30,615
According to those who were there,

273
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:33,576
it was a one-sided battle.

274
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,705
Impossible! Her magic was beaten?

275
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,540
Was it a Hero?

276
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,418
No, it was someone in white.

277
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,795
Most likely one of the Rescue Squad.

278
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,797
Was it Rose?

279
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,592
No, it was a black-haired boy.

280
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,669
There was... another one?

281
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,809
Hyriluk, call Baljinak back.

282
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:00,686
We're falling back.

283
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:02,509
Are you serious?

284
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,274
I <i>should</i> join the battle,

285
00:17:05,275 --> 00:17:08,110
but I won't be able to protect
the base with just the soldiers.

286
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,198
Not to mention, they still have
Army Commander Siglis on their side.

287
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,481
Any more fighting...

288
00:17:14,481 --> 00:17:15,743
would be pointless.

289
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,412
We don't have any healers,

290
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,498
so it's just a matter of time.

291
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,000
All right. I'll issue the order.

292
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:25,795
What's wrong?

293
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,838
It's the Heroes.

294
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:32,093
Time to show them what we're made of.

295
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:32,885
Right.

296
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:36,055
Let's kick this guy's butt and go home!

297
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,426
Let's do this!

298
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,707
Usato! No slacking!

299
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:05,084
Shut up! I'm not slacking!

300
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,422
He got poisoned. You know what to do.

301
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,464
Got it!

302
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,716
I'll heal you now.

303
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,606
We did it, Senpai!

304
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,692
Yup! You really <i>are</i> dependable!

305
00:18:37,767 --> 00:18:39,118
It's all over!

306
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,037
Please take it easy for now.

307
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,789
G-got it.

308
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,790
Thanks.

309
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,626
No, thank <i>you</i> for making it back alive!

310
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,588
Looks like we've won this battle.

311
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,573
Are you serious?!

312
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,885
They've begun to retreat.

313
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,511
We're not giving chase?

314
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,679
Are you crazy?

315
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,641
Compared to them, we've spent
far more energy and resources.

316
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,102
We should avoid unnecessary sacrifices
and prepare for the next attack.

317
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,314
There'll be another one?

318
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,941
Don't see why there won't be.

319
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,737
Usato! We need you over here!

320
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,197
Coming!

321
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,406
I got it.

322
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:19,600
...thanks.

323
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,414
We were only able to win this battle

324
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:29,543
because you were able
to revive the Heroes.

325
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,048
You would have saved
them even if I wasn't here.

326
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:35,508
They would have been saved regardless.

327
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,592
No.

328
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,512
They would have died.

329
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,807
<i>You</i> saved them.

330
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:45,393
Not Siglis. Not me.

331
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,393
Got it?

332
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:50,981
Without you, we wouldn't
have won so quickly.

333
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:54,318
There was a chance
we might have even lost.

334
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,240
You have done your job as
a member of the Rescue Squad.

335
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,161
Well done, Usato.

336
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,580
Huh? Why am I...?

337
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,625
Look at you.

338
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,587
You're crying like a kid!

339
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,423
Duh! I'm still 17!

340
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:03,012
The battle was really scary,

341
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,513
and so were the demons!

342
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,725
I saw many people die...

343
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,393
but...

344
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:11,312
but...

345
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,230
I'm so happy to have met you...

346
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,983
and to have been of help.

347
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,109
I really am.

348
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:28,412
Someone said the same thing to me once.

349
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:32,541
Now, they're just a part of my memory.

350
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,796
But you're here, right in front of me.

351
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Usato...

352
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,218
Thank you for making it back alive.

353
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,387
My pleasure!

354
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,475
Huh?

355
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,235
No more magic or stamina, huh?

356
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:04,114
You really hung in there.

357
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,617
Now, rest.

358
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:15,733
<i>The beginning was sudden and silent.</i>

359
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:23,488
<i>Then, everything before
me began to change.</i>

360
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:41,259
<i>Even the stones lying at my feet</i>

361
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:47,473
<i>seem to shine a little brighter.</i>

362
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:56,983
<i>That's because you're reflected in them.</i>

363
00:22:56,983 --> 00:23:02,363
<i>Like a young leaf that's just sprouted,</i>

364
00:23:02,363 --> 00:23:08,325
<i>you're brimming with a translucent light.</i>

365
00:23:09,787 --> 00:23:14,834
<i>Let the wind blow you onward.</i>

366
00:23:14,834 --> 00:23:20,506
<i>If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.</i>

that's awakened in your heart.</i>
