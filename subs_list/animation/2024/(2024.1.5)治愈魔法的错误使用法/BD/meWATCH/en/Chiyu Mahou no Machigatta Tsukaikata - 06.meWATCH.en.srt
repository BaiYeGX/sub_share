00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:03,420
Oh! Usato, Suzune!

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,464
Glad to see you both safe and sound.

3
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,799
I apologize for causing you undue worry.

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:10,177
No, we should be the ones to apologize.

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:12,304
That must have not been easy.

6
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,057
Usato, I apologize for getting
you mixed up in all this.

7
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,684
Oh, no, I'm fine.

8
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,770
I'm more than used to
being in situations like those.

9
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,438
You're "used to"?

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,024
<i>I-I shouldn't have said that!</i>

11
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,986
Yes, for you see...

12
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,989
back in my old world, I often
went trekking in the woods.

13
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,283
Oh, that's what you meant.

14
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,785
By the way, Usato...

15
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,539
How's your Rescue Squad training going?

16
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:39,498
Huh?

17
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:42,042
<i>That's a tough one to answer!</i>

18
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,714
I-it's been nothing <i>but</i> smooth sailing!

19
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,635
Smooth sailing, you say?

20
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,303
That's good to hear.

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,346
Y-yup!

22
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,642
<i>That expression!</i>

23
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,602
<i>It's as if I said exactly what
she wanted me to say!</i>

24
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:04,815
<i>Have I been conditioned by Rose
on a psychological level as well?</i>

25
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,566
<i>That's so annoying!</i>

26
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,487
We will rearrange Suzune's training.

27
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,156
Please, rest well today.

28
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,200
We will. Thank you.

29
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,661
The two of you are dismissed.

30
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,247
Rose, Siglis, could the
two of you remain behind?

31
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,540
Of course.

32
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,541
Very well.

Oh, no.

55
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:06,603
I was just wondering
what they're talking about.

56
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:10,399
That minister guy's face was rather grave.

57
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,402
Oh, Sergio-san? I guess you're right.

58
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:15,862
Are they going to fire us or something?

59
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,907
Nah, I don't think so.

60
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,409
Usato! Senpai!

61
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,745
Please wait up, Kazuki-sama!

62
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,457
It's Kazuki! Long time no see!

63
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:28,583
Celia-sama, too!

64
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,877
You're being far too casual!

65
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,213
You guys were attacked
by monsters and went missing!

66
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,507
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

67
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:38,134
Sorry, I didn't realize...

68
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,638
Kazuki-sama was all but ready
to dash out of the castle!

69
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,015
He was going to find
the two of you himself.

70
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:48,061
You sure are reckless,
aren't you, Kazuki-kun?

71
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,897
Reckless? You're one to talk...

72
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,441
You were even bitten
by that little monkey.

73
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,193
U-Usato-kun! That's not fair!

74
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,654
Usato... what little monkey?

75
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,864
Well, you see, Inu--

76
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,574
I-it's nothing! Nothing at all!

77
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,743
Right? Usato-kun?

78
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,623
Huh? That's what the captain said?

79
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,708
Yup.

80
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:11,293
That the two of you
will be just fine.

81
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,171
And that you're not
going to die that easily.

82
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,464
She sure calmed me down.

83
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,758
<i>I bet she was thinking,</i>

84
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,343
<i>"He's having it on Easy Mode
compared to my training.</i>

85
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,603
<i>there's no way he's going to die."</i>

86
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,266
Rose-san had complete faith in you.

87
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,518
I was in awe.

88
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,813
<i>To take her words at face value...</i>

89
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:35,525
<i>Kazuki... what a pure, sweet,
innocent boy you are.</i>

90
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,112
Never change, Kazuki.

91
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,782
Only Senpai and I need to be tainted.

92
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:43,908
All right...

93
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:46,369
I have no idea what you're
talking about, but okay.

94
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,706
He's calling me tainted right to my face!

95
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,333
What's that about?!

96
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,627
Tell me, what do you mean?!

97
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56,213
N-no, Senpai, that was
just a figure of speech!

98
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,007
See you later, Usato!

99
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,051
See you at practice tomorrow, Senpai!

100
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,928
Please have a good rest.

101
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:03,887
Will do!

102
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,931
Later, Kazuki-kun, Celia!

103
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:06,765
See ya!

104
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,019
The two of them are
really close, aren't they?

105
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,771
Senpai and Usato?

106
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,816
Yup. Recently, they've gotten even closer.

107
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,568
No, I meant close to you.

108
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,698
Kazuki-sama, you looked like
you were really enjoying yourself.

109
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:27,869
Oh, that's because we were
already friends before coming here.

110
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,123
Celia-san?

111
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,379
Could I be one of your friends, too?

112
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:42,384
Suzune-sama calls me Celia.

113
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:46,513
Would it be too much if...
I asked you to call me Celia, too?

114
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,643
I apologize, Kazuki-sama.

115
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:53,561
You don't have to force yourself...

116
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,938
N-no, not at all.

117
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,525
Very well. I will call you
Celia from now on.

118
00:05:58,984 --> 00:05:59,985
How's that?

119
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,529
Thank you!

120
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,199
Now then... let's get down to business.

121
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:11,204
We have interrogated the bandits
who attacked Usato's group.

122
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,080
Sergio.

123
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,039
Yes, Your Majesty.

124
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,376
When the bandits were crossing the plains,

125
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,296
they noticed far fewer
monsters than normal.

126
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:24,759
Right after, they were attacked by
a herd of Fall Boars in the forest.

127
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,346
If what they said is true,

128
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:32,017
then the monsters must be
fleeing the plains for the forest.

129
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:35,353
Fleeing from something terrible...

130
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,272
headed this way.

131
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,691
The Demon Lord's Army?

132
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,360
I believe so.

133
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,738
They're making their way here...

134
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,406
finally.

135
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:52,412
Unlike during our previous battle,
they won't underestimate us again.

136
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,458
They will use everything at their
disposal to capture our kingdom.

137
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,294
Indeed... they will.

138
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,464
Siglis, relay this message
to all the commanding officers.

139
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:05,300
Be ready to mobilize
the troops at any time.

140
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,552
Consider it done, Your Majesty.

141
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,095
I will head out at once.

142
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,307
Sergio, inform the other ministers.

143
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:13,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,605
I apologize for the wait, Rose.

145
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:20,523
I have something to request from you, too.

146
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:25,654
I wouldn't normally assign this mission
to the captain of the Rescue Squad, but...

147
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,948
Not a problem, Lloyd-sama.

148
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,369
You want me to see how far the
Demon Lord's Army has come, right?

149
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,537
Precisely.

150
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,664
I am sorry.

151
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,624
Don't be.

152
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,586
I'm well aware that I'm
the fastest in the kingdom.

153
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:43,129
If that is all...

154
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,673
One more thing.

155
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,138
Rose...

156
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,849
will you consider returning to
your post as battalion commander?

157
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,227
No, I will not.

158
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:01,856
I bear more guilt than you think.

159
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:07,278
You were the first healer to be
appointed as battalion commander.

160
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,323
Why do you criticize yourself so?

161
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,783
It's not self-loathing.

162
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,868
It's the truth.

163
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,414
You haven't forgiven yourself, have you?

164
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,250
No, I have not.

165
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,918
How could I forget?

166
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,213
I've accepted the deaths
of all my subordinates

167
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,217
and the fact that no amount
of healing will bring them back.

168
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,012
The scar that has been
carved into my right eye

169
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,015
will never let me forget them.

170
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,851
But that is not your burden to bear.

171
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,686
It <i>is</i> my burden to bear!

172
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,897
They died because
I was too full of myself.

173
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,192
That is when I realized.

174
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,986
That no matter how skilled you are...

175
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,071
that no matter how trustworthy you are...

176
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,948
it's all over when you're dead.

177
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,784
This scar is my punishment.

178
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,245
It will never let me forget my sins.

179
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,333
That is why I created the Rescue Squad.

180
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:06,087
Not to fight,
but to focus on saving lives.

181
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:08,715
Indeed...

182
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:13,553
The Rescue Squad saved a great
many men during the battle two years ago.

183
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,474
Have you not already achieved your goal?

184
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:22,145
No, there is another reason
the Rescue Squad exists.

185
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,813
...and that is?

186
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:25,815
I want to find...

187
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,734
a subordinate who will not die.

188
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,818
Wha...

189
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,614
That's not something humanly possible!

190
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,158
That's what all the training is for.

191
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:38,703
Healing magic, the determination
to push one's body beyond its limits,

192
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:41,498
and an iron will that will never
bend in the face of any opponent.

193
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,917
I've been searching all this time...

194
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,503
for someone who has all three.

195
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,670
...and that's Usato.

196
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:50,548
Usato has everything
I've been looking for.

197
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:55,303
Survival instincts, adaptability,
and the will to live.

198
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,097
At best, he's someone who hates to lose.

199
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:01,726
At worst, he's someone who's easily
influenced by those around him.

200
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,687
On top of that, no matter what I do,

201
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:08,191
he keeps standing up to me.

202
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:09,631
He will never give up.

203
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,486
It's as if...

204
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,404
That's right.

205
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:17,450
He's a cheeky brat who reminds me
of the guys who are no longer with us.

206
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:22,747
That is why I'm determined
to make him the ideal healer.

207
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,126
My apologies.

208
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,044
I spoke out of turn.

209
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,374
I will head to the border at once.

210
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,210
I am counting on you.

211
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,180
Oh? Alec, what's this?

212
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,057
This is for me, isn't it?

213
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:46,645
Big Sis left it there for ya
when yer were feedin' Blurin.

214
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,398
This doesn't bode well...

215
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,321
<i>No training tomorrow.</i>

216
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,533
<i>Instead, deliver the enclosed letter here.</i>

217
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,411
So, where did the captain go?

218
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,579
Who knows?

219
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,790
All she said was that she
ain't gonna be needin' dinner.

220
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,925
The bridge is almost complete!

221
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:16,718
Keep up the pace!

222
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,345
We are the Demon Lord's spear!

223
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,848
Work your bodies to the bone
in service of the Demon Lord!

224
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,225
Not again...

225
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,768
What is it, Black Knight?

226
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,312
Something you want to say?

227
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,565
You're being way too
enthusiastic about all this.

228
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,066
Frankly, it's annoying.

229
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,068
How dare you?!

230
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,363
That is no way to talk
to your superior officer!

231
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,324
Oh, I'm <i>so</i> sorry.

232
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:43,578
We were all pretty much
equal in the Second Army.

233
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:48,750
I don't care. As of now,
you're under <i>my</i> command.

234
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:51,044
You best obey my every order.

235
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,296
Sure, sure. Whatever you say.

236
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:55,381
Just call me when the bridge is ready.

237
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,135
You look like you're struggling.

238
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,595
What do you want, Hyriluk?

239
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,680
Come to laugh at me?

240
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,599
My, my, aren't you on edge today?

241
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,851
I'm just here to give you moral support.

242
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,771
The bridge construction...
looks to be coming along just fine.

243
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,273
Indeed. It will be finished
in a few more hours.

244
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,359
Then, it can finally begin.

245
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,570
Our invasion of the Llinger Kingdom!

246
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:18,696
Commander!

247
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:19,989
There's someone on the other side!

248
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,116
An enemy scout?

249
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,618
Almost certainly!

250
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,536
Leave them be.

251
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:29,958
By the time they've spread
the word, we'll already be...

252
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,048
What happened?!

253
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,386
I think a tree trunk came
flying from the other side...

254
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,804
A tree trunk?!

255
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:43,638
From that distance?!

256
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,943
Damn you, Rose!

257
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:00,154
<i>This was </i>supposed<i> to be
a reconnaissance mission.</i>

258
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:04,409
<i>Oh, well. I was at least able
to buy us a couple of days.</i>

259
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:09,205
<i>Hmm... am I going in the right direction?</i>

260
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:12,083
<i>I have to say, this
is a very detailed map.</i>

261
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,002
<i>Did Rose draw this?</i>

262
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,254
<i>Is she actually capable
of being this meticulous?</i>

263
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,463
Look at that guy!

264
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,674
Wait, he's a member of the
Rescue Squad, isn't he?

265
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:23,052
<i>Are people staring at me?</i>

266
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,471
<i>But I didn't even bring
Blurin along today...</i>

267
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,307
Why's he just walking normally?

268
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,516
I wonder why...

269
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,644
<i>I'm drawing more attention
by</i> not <i>doing anything weird?</i>

270
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,937
<i>What's up with that?</i>

271
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,856
Oh, it's you!

272
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,191
Oh, good afternoon!

273
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,153
The little blue guy not with you today?

274
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,529
How about some of his favorite fruits?

275
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,324
Just got a fresh batch in today!

276
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,075
Yes, please!

277
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,869
Oh, but I have somewhere to be.
I'll pick them up on the way back.

278
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,663
Not a problem! I'll be waiting!

279
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,251
Is this the place?

280
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,338
Excuse me!

281
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,423
I'll be right there!

282
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,633
Good afternoon!

283
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,093
How may I help...

284
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,553
A Rescue Squad member?

285
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,096
Oh, I know!

286
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,558
You're the one who
just joined, aren't you?!

287
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,643
Yes, I'm...

288
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,145
Wait! Don't say a thing.

289
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,731
Onii-chan told me your name!

290
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:19,192
What was it again?

291
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,903
It was something like Usagi...

292
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,363
No, that's not it.

293
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:24,280
Tanuki!

294
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,073
Squirrel!

295
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:25,948
Cat!

296
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,116
It's Usato...

297
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,327
That's it! Usato-kun!

298
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,913
Oh, and I'm Ururu Fleur.

299
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,373
I'm 18!

300
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,540
What about you?

301
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,853
I'm 17...

302
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:38,628
One year younger, huh?

303
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,545
Y-yeah.

304
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,799
E-er, you're Orga-san's
younger sister, right?

305
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
You're a healer, too?

306
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:45,716
Yup!

307
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:50,223
And you're standing in Fleur Clinic!
It's run by me and my brother.

308
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,766
Welcome!

309
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,392
I-I see...

310
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,144
...and where's Orga-san?

311
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,981
He's examining a patient.

312
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,525
Wanna see?

313
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,943
C-can I?

314
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,362
Of course! Just follow me.

315
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,534
W-why does it feel like
we're sneaking a peek?

316
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:13,704
Quiet! Onii-chan needs to concentrate!

317
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,747
Right...

318
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,466
<i>The color is so intense,
and the flow is so smooth!</i>

319
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,177
<i>Completely unlike mine!</i>

320
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,772
There, all done. How do you feel?

321
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,236
I don't feel sick anymore!

322
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,737
I'm all better, Mama!

323
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,824
Thank you so much, Sensei!

324
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:52,160
My pleasure!

325
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,080
Hey, Sensei, who are those guys?

326
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,459
Usato-kun!

327
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,254
I see. A letter from Rose-san?

328
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,173
Thank you for coming all this way.

329
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:10,219
No, no. I've been meaning
to pop by your clinic one day.

330
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,846
Hey, hey, Usato-kun!

331
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,265
How are the Rescue Squad guys doing?

332
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:15,808
You mean Tong and the others?

333
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,227
They're all still sporting bad-guy faces.

334
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:22,106
That means they're doing fine!

335
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,735
I really miss Alec's cooking!

336
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,736
Oh, that's right!

337
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,030
You're part of the Rescue Squad, too!

338
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,864
Yup!

339
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:33,910
Unlike you, I just couldn't
keep up with the training...

340
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,745
Why did you quit?

341
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,704
Well...

342
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,207
I might not be as good as Onii-chan,

343
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:42,210
but I'm also better at healing others.

344
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,295
But the biggest reason is that

345
00:16:44,295 --> 00:16:46,756
I didn't want to worry Onii-chan.

346
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:50,384
Guilty as charged!

347
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:53,678
But I <i>do</i> feel bad...

348
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,228
When we first joined, Rose-san
put everything into training us.

349
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:04,565
It was right after she
started the Rescue Squad.

350
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,527
We were really pumped about it, too.

351
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,321
But it didn't work out.

352
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,282
Not only could I not keep up,

353
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,452
but I also became
really afraid of Rose-san.

354
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:21,121
Back then, it was like she was desperate.

355
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,334
Desperate?

356
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,505
Oh, but she seems much happier now.

357
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,631
Right...

358
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:32,426
<i>She's just happy she got
herself a new punching bag.</i>

359
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,762
Sensei! Please come quickly!

360
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,389
What happened?

361
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,892
My friend fell off the
roof while fixing it!

362
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,019
Two others got injured as well.

363
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,437
Got it.

364
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,606
Usato-kun, mind coming with us?

365
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,525
O-of course not!

366
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,819
Excuse me! Please clear the way!

367
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,445
Over here, Sensei!

368
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,990
Orga-san! What's the plan?

369
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,412
S-sorry, I forgot...

370
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,497
It's fine, it's fine!

371
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:02,915
This happens all the time.

372
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,083
Don't worry about it.

373
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,797
We should treat them immediately.

374
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,549
Usato-kun, could I leave him to you?

375
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,634
O-of course!

376
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,475
<i>Other than myself,</i>

377
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,103
<i>I've only ever healed
Orga-san and Inukami-senpai...</i>

378
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,190
<i>Their injuries weren't critical either.</i>

379
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,776
<i>But if war breaks out...</i>

380
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,779
<i>I will have to treat injuries
even more severe than this</i>

381
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,448
<i>right in the middle of battle.</i>

382
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,869
<i>I knew that's what all
that training was for, but...</i>

383
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,996
Calm down, Usato-kun.

384
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:47,418
Who you're treating or where you're
treating them doesn't matter.

385
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,588
You have the power to heal them.

386
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,049
All you have to do is to believe...

387
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,508
that you can do it.

388
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:59,055
Rose-san had complete faith in you.

389
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,973
<i>That's right.</i>

390
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,392
<i>Even Rose believes in me.</i>

391
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,853
<i>I have to believe in myself.</i>

392
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,898
Thank you, Orga-san.

393
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:26,123
Good job, Usato-kun!

394
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,584
You really saved us there.

395
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,627
Did I really do a good job?

396
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,381
You did a perfect job!

397
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,884
That guy was amazed he couldn't
feel any pain at all, wasn't he?!

398
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,093
H-he was!

399
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:42,473
I'd appreciate it if you could drop by
to lend a hand when you're free.

400
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:45,518
It's tough with just the two of us.

401
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,145
No thanks to your lousy constitution!

402
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,815
You don't pull any punches, do you?

403
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:53,234
S-sure! I'll be back!

404
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,069
See ya!

405
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,155
Way to go, Onii-chan!

406
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,573
Oh, what's this about?

407
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,284
When you were giving Usato-kun advice?

408
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,828
You were so cool!

409
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,539
You think?

410
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,582
Ururu.

411
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,293
About that letter from Rose-san.

412
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,633
We have been summoned to go to war.

413
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,553
The Demon Lord's Army is close.

414
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,848
The same goes for you,

415
00:20:23,849 --> 00:20:27,976
but Usato-san doesn't have
any experience on the battlefield.

416
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,521
The only thing that he can rely on...

417
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:33,023
is an absolute confidence
in his own abilities.

418
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:39,196
I think Rose-san knows what she's doing.

419
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,074
But I'll do everything I can, too.

420
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,409
I see...

421
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:45,835
It's starting, isn't it?

422
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,538
War?

423
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,496
Yeah.

424
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,460
Everything will be all right.

425
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,132
I threw in a few extra!

426
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,676
Wow, thank you so much!

427
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,430
Hm... delicious!

428
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:06,557
Blurin will love these!

429
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,687
Is something wrong?

430
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,272
Are you lost?

431
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,358
You are the only one who could see it.

432
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,363
That is why this is a
future you can change.

433
00:21:57,858 --> 00:22:01,194
I have done you a great favor.

434
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,365
You now have a duty to repay me.

435
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:08,655
What?

436
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:15,724
<i>The beginning was sudden and silent.</i>

437
00:22:15,724 --> 00:22:23,479
<i>Then, everything before
me began to change.</i>

438
00:22:35,369 --> 00:22:41,250
<i>Even the stones lying at my feet</i>

439
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:47,464
<i>seem to shine a little brighter.</i>

440
00:22:47,464 --> 00:22:56,974
<i>That's because you're reflected in them.</i>

441
00:22:56,974 --> 00:23:02,354
<i>Like a young leaf that's just sprouted,</i>

442
00:23:02,354 --> 00:23:08,316
<i>you're brimming with a translucent light.</i>

443
00:23:09,778 --> 00:23:14,825
<i>Let the wind blow you onward.</i>

444
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:20,497
<i>If I'm with you, I can go anywhere.</i>

445
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:26,587
<i>Even if you're not special,
you can be anything.</i>

446
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:39,224
<i>Let me believe in the strength
that's awakened in your heart.</i>
