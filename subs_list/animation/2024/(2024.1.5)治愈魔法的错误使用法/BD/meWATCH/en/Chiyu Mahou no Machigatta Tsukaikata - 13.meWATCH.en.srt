00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,419
I've been waiting.

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,796
Now for you to pay me back.

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:07,591
Healer...

4
00:00:08,467 --> 00:00:09,927
please save...

5
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:11,887
my mom.

6
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,976
Who's this fox-eared girl, Usato-kun?!

7
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:20,562
She's adorable! Can I pet her?

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,148
You were the only one I could count on.

9
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:25,609
Me? What do you mean?

10
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:26,881
No reaction, huh?

11
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:29,988
You love teasing me, don't you?

12
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:30,740
Very well!

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,492
Please continue if you're
fine with turning me on!

14
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:35,244
Jeez, you're such a bother!

15
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,995
You're just like a needy child!

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,205
Erm...

17
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,667
Mind putting me down first?

18
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:42,918
Oh, I'm sorry.

19
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,463
I'm Amako.

20
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,216
As you can see, I'm a fox beastman.

00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,593

00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,751
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

What's this? You're slow for a demon!

00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,243

Don't lump me together

00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,791
How rude!

47
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,917

00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,213

I can't move.

00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,595
I don't care anymore.

52
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,722
That's it for me...

53
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,891
Stop slacking off!

54
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,144
Get running!

55
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,104
You're not even halfway done!

56
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:09,064
Y-yes, ma'am!

57
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,983
The others are all out training.

58
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,276
You can rest easy.

59
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,738
She's so cute!

60
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:17,447
I want to fluff up her hair!

61
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,952
Are you sure you're fine with her here?

62
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,079
It's all right.

63
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,374
The Hero will keep my secret.

64
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,209
Of course, I will!

65
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,086
You know she's a Hero?

66
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,546
I do.

67
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,589
I also know that you're Usato

68
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,384
and use some weird kind of healing magic.

69
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:41,513
I guess it <i>is</i> weird,
so I'll let that slide.

70
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,558
I have a ton to ask you.

71
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,894
Firstly, why did you show me that vision?

72
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,274
The one where Senpai and Kazuki
were killed by the Black Knight.

73
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,276
Huh? You saw something like that?

74
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,570
If I hadn't shown you that,

75
00:03:56,571 --> 00:03:57,988
the Heroes would have died

76
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,698
and this country would
have been destroyed.

77
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,327
So, that <i>was</i> a vision of the future.

78
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:06,580
That's right.

79
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,916
I can use magic to see into the future.

80
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,794
I first saw that vision about a year ago.

81
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:16,089
There are many people from
this country I'm indebted to.

82
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,383
More importantly,

83
00:04:17,383 --> 00:04:20,552
I couldn't afford to lose you
after finally finding you.

84
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,306
Were you looking for
a healer all this time?

85
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:25,307
I was.

86
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:28,435
That is why I left the Beastlands.

87
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,438
The Beastlands?

88
00:04:30,438 --> 00:04:32,564
Aren't they really far away from here?

89
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:35,066
I had no other choice.

90
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,194
I just had to save my mom.

91
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,280
She won't wake up no matter what.

92
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,491
That is why I've been
looking for a healer.

93
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:48,455
I left the Beastlands because
only humans can use healing magic.

94
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,209
But no matter where I looked,
no one could save my mom.

95
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:55,754
And that's when you found
Usato-kun in this country.

96
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,173
But what about Orga-san and Ururu-san?

97
00:04:58,173 --> 00:04:59,424
The ones from the clinic?

98
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,303
I'm sure they'd be
more than willing to help.

99
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,640
Those two can't fight.

100
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,224
I can't take them back with me.

101
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,059
I see...

102
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,435
Then, what about Rose-san?

103
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,271
I haven't talked to that scary person.

104
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,732
I had a vision of her
declining my request.

105
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:20,153
Right... I'd probably say
the same if I were her.

106
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:22,197
And that's why you chose me.

107
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:25,700
You'll come back with me.

108
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,993
I knew it at a glance.

109
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,120
That's who you are, after all.

110
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,789
That is why I showed you the future.

111
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,084
Usato, come to the Beastlands,

112
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,294
and save my mom!

113
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,632
That might be easier said than done.

114
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:45,095
Right now, Usato-kun is really
important to this country...

115
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,101
No, it might be possible.

116
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,897
Have you heard about
the mission to deliver letters?

117
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,649
I have, what about it?

118
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,192
Wait, you don't mean...?

119
00:05:59,193 --> 00:06:00,110
I do.

120
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,573
What if I was able to visit
the Beastlands while on that journey?

121
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:05,574
That's right...

122
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,992
That's a good idea!

123
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,536
I'll have to ask Lloyd-sama eventually,

124
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:12,163
but I'll run it by the captain first.

125
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,833
Could you wait here for me?

126
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,924
If she attempts to do anything
funny to you, just scream.

127
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,595
What do you take me for, Usato-kun?

128
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,764
That beastman girl is
a precognitive princess?

129
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,182
You'd better not be joking.

130
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,603
We have to inform Lloyd-sama immediately.

131
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,730
Is it <i>that</i> big of a deal?

132
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,523
It's the biggest of deals.

133
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,109
Precognitive princesses.

134
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:44,487
They warn fellow beastmen
about impending disasters.

135
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,241
If the beastmen find out that
we're harboring one of them,

136
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,868
they might attack us.

137
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:51,536
I see...

138
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,914
That being said...

139
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:57,793
your wish to go to the Beastlands

140
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:02,130
might be granted <i>because</i> of this.

141
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:03,882
Just wait and see.

142
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:04,633
I will.

143
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,428
Sorry for the wait.

144
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,434
So... it's going to take a while.

145
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,813
<i>Did she predict what I was going to say?</i>

146
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,482
You don't need words to
understand each other?

147
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,943
How frustrating! It's like I've lost!

148
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,778
Lost at what?

149
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,155
Don't worry,

150
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:28,823
Lloyd-sama will definitely
give it some thought.

151
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,242
Thanks. I'm going home.

152
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,037
Usato.

153
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,163
Yeah?

154
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,332
Thank you.

155
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,253
No, thank <i>you</i>.

156
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,215
<i>I was able to protect them because of you.</i>

157
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,467
<i>Both Kazuki and Senpai.</i>

158
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,427
What is it?

159
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,054
Nothing at all.

160
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,943
What's this? Too good fer my food?

161
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,987
Shut up. Don't talk to me.

162
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,446
You'd better eat up.

163
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,323
Usato!

164
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,034
Otherwise, you'll collapse
from hunger tomorrow.

165
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,413
This hell's not going to end, is it?

166
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:18,123
Not tomorrow, not the day after...

167
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,208
Just throw me back in jail.

168
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,254
Here, this is for you.

169
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,839
I bought it in the market.

170
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,717
It's a diary.

171
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,805
Write in it every day about
your training or your thoughts.

172
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,224
You'll feel better if you do.

173
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,122
<i>I've decided to use
the diary Usato got me.</i>

174
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,208
<i>On the second day of training,</i>

175
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,710
<i>I ran until I couldn't
move anymore.</i>

176
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,420
<i>And yet... </i>

177
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,297
Oh, what's this?

178
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:08,465
Get your ass in gear!

179
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,594
You gotta do better!

180
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,387
<i>Why are you people laughing?</i>

181
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,347
<i>There's something wrong with you lot!</i>

182
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,643
<i>Day Five. I ran with Usato today.</i>

183
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,315
<i>Strangely enough, Usato didn't
seem to ever run out of breath.</i>

184
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,318
<i>Usato's an inhuman human.</i>

185
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,403
<i>That's how I choose to see him.</i>

186
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,113
<i>Day 10.</i>

187
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:36,409
<i>Recently, I've been hearing
something coming from the forest.</i>

188
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,203
<i>I wonder what it is.</i>

189
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,998
<i>I decided to take a look
while skipping training.</i>

190
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,009
<i>No way he's still alive after that!</i>

191
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,809
Hey! I told you to dodge, didn't I?

192
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,603
All you've been able to
master is taking punches!

193
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,524
If you keep changing the
trajectory of your punches,

194
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:08,233
How the heck am I supposed to dodge?

195
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:10,819
Just use your damn eyes!

196
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,112
Like that's gonna happen!

197
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,031
<i>What's going on?</i>

198
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,242
You dare get angry at me?

199
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:18,743
You're one to talk!

200
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,914
Save the cheek for when
you can avoid my punches!

201
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,292
We're trying this again!

202
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,502
Don't need to tell me twice!

203
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,218
Where'd she go?

204
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,019
He avoided it!

205
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,437
All right! I did it!

206
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,857
Don't let your guard down!

207
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,694
A-are you okay?

208
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,323
I did it! I dodged it!

209
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,034
Have to say... good job.

210
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,077
You may return to your regular training.

211
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:02,704
Thank you very much, ma'am!

212
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,832
H-he really <i>is</i> inhuman...

213
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,501
Hey, little girl!

214
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,461
Continue training under Usato's orders.

215
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,257
You saw that?

216
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,177
The captain's a monster, isn't she?

217
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,972
You're a little bit of
a monster too, you know?

218
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,932
What was that?

219
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,017
Nothing.

220
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,980
It's a little bit late, but
could I ask you something?

221
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,941
What is it?

222
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:34,819
Your name.

223
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,197
It really <i>is</i> late.

224
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,489
My bad, my bad.

225
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,824
There never was a good time to ask.

226
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,244
My name, huh?

227
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,874
I-it's Felm.

228
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:51,252
Not many people have
called me that though...

229
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,545
Right. Got it.

230
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,380
Oh, Blurin!

231
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,010
You wanna exercise, too?

232
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,428
All right, let's run!

233
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,428
Here we go!

234
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,598
Wait...

235
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,808
That's it?

236
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,227
What's it?

237
00:12:10,813 --> 00:12:12,899
You asked for my name.

238
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,736
You're not going to use it?

239
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:16,694
Hey, Blurin!

240
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:17,970
Wait for me!

241
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,991
Damn it!

242
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,035
W-wait up!

243
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:24,953
You're going to exhaust
yourself at that pace!

244
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,872
Shut it! I ain't gonna lose to you!

245
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,749
What? She collapsed?

246
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:30,584
Yeah...

247
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:33,461
She ran full speed without
thinking about the consequences.

248
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,089
But I healed her up and put her to sleep.

249
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,131
She should be fine.

250
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:41,045
Jeez... give her some food later.

251
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:41,928
Got it.

252
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,098
What did ya do to the little lady?

253
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,016
I didn't do anything!

254
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,185
I just ran normally.

255
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,729
Your normal ain't normal.

256
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,399
Not normal for a human, at least.

257
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:56,985
Can it.

258
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,904
I'm far more human than the captain!

259
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,589
Come now, guys!

260
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,716
That's not a very nice thing to say.

261
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,718
Guess I went a little overboard myself.

262
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:24,595
So did we.

263
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,807
Punishment avoided!

264
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:28,599
Hey, Usato.

265
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,018
Yes, ma'am?!

266
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,939
I'm hungry...

267
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,901
Go see Lloyd-sama tomorrow morning.

268
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,946
And bring that fox beastman girl with you.

269
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,823
Does that mean...?

270
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:47,243
The details of your journey to
deliver letters have been confirmed.

271
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,122
They've also made a decision
regarding your request.

272
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,082
All right.

273
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,502
A journey to deliver letters?

274
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,699
I've never been inside the castle before.

275
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,084
So, you're Amako?

276
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,252
Yes, I am.

277
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,172
Well done making it all the way here,

278
00:14:40,172 --> 00:14:41,547
my dear Amako.

279
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,888
For saving this kingdom from destruction,

280
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,932
I offer you my deepest gratitude.

281
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:53,768
Erm... wait, what?

282
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:58,648
To the savior of our kingdom,
I would also like to offer my help.

283
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,191
Therefore, Usato...

284
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:01,734
Yes, Your Majesty?

285
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,863
I have factored your
request into my plans.

286
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,617
You will be visiting various countries,

287
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,451
with Mialark being the last.

288
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,328
Mialark?

289
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,124
It is a country of water,
located upon the great river

290
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:16,916
that runs through the continent.

291
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,503
The Beastlands are located
on the opposite shore.

292
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,629
That means...

293
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,549
Go visit the Beastlands with Amako.

294
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:26,717
I will!

295
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,428
Thank you very much!

296
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,348
Welcie will fill you in on the details.

297
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,518
Yup! Just leave it to me!

298
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,104
With that said,

299
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:39,814
you'll be visiting four countries.

300
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,108
The City of Magic, Luqvist.

301
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,901
The Country of Prayer, Samariarl

302
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,528
The Country of Water, Mialark

303
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,364
...and finally, the Beastlands.

304
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:52,785
Suzune-sama, Kazuki-sama, and I
will accompany you to Luqvist.

305
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:58,207
From there, it will be just you,
Amako-sama, and several knights.

306
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,293
Several knights?

307
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:02,293
How many will be accompanying us?

308
00:16:02,293 --> 00:16:06,632
Too many will raise suspicions.

309
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,634
...so about two?

310
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,804
Would you like us to recommend some men?

311
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:15,016
Me?

312
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:15,850
Indeed.

313
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,810
I would love for you to join us.

314
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,897
Would that be all right?

315
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,025
Usato-dono.

316
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,235
I'm clumsy.

317
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,862
I can only protect one thing at a time.

318
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,197
Right.

319
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,824
That is why I guard the gates.

320
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,785
As long as I am here,

321
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,495
no one will be able to get through.

322
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,414
No one inside will get hurt.

323
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,416
I guess that's a no...?

324
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,084
But...

325
00:16:41,084 --> 00:16:44,295
I'll leave them in my colleague's
care for the time being.

326
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,257
I, Aruku,

327
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:53,346
swear that I will protect both
you and Amako-dono with my life!

328
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,681
Thank you! Thank you so much!

329
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,309
That went nice and smooth!

330
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,062
What about your other companion?

331
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,563
Let's see...

332
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,482
what about him?

333
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,001
Just when I thought
you'd started behaving.

334
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,505
I can't believe you're now trying to run.

335
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,633
Looks like I gave you too much freedom.

336
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:36,597
You overheard our conversation
last night, didn't you?

337
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,684
For a moment, I thought you were trying

338
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:41,727
to relay the information
to the Demon Lord's Army.

339
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,231
But I found you not far
from the lodging house.

340
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:46,524
So, that's out the window.

341
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,944
Aren't you worried?

342
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,237
Worried?

343
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,154
About what?

344
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,825
About Usato.

345
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:57,034
He's going to go far away.

346
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,414
Him? Not at all.

347
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:06,460
He's a healer who's
nearly as good as I am.

348
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,296
He's not going to die that easy.

349
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,549
What's this?

350
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,884
Don't tell me you were worried about him?

351
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,430
You wanted to sneak away
to join him on his journey?

352
00:18:17,868 --> 00:18:20,224
Not at all! No way!

353
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,060
It's just that I was tired of all this.

354
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,260
That's why I...

355
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,314
Tired, huh?

356
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,275
I'll take you there right away.

357
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,901
There? Where?

358
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,112
Well, not right away.

359
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,864
For starters, get to running.

360
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,115
All the way back to the house!

361
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,744
To think you'd try to escape.

362
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,828
I'm impressed!

363
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,499
You're going away, aren't you?

364
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,336
Yup. We're leaving tomorrow.

365
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,714
What's up?

366
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:55,384
I know!
Going to miss me when I'm gone?

367
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:02,642
It's not fair that only you
get to escape this hell.

368
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,518
Oh, that's all?

369
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:06,812
You little...

370
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:08,315
Stop it, stop it!

371
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,692
Stop with the kicking, Felm!

372
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,949
Wonder what that was all about.

373
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:22,411
Leaving tomorrow, huh? That's sudden.

374
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,497
That's rich, coming from you.

375
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:27,625
You took me to the Darkness of Llinger
without any warning, remember?

376
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,753
Yeah, I remember.

377
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:33,631
But this journey's different.

378
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,342
Here's a piece of advice for you.

379
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,635
 What is it?

380
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:39,262
The reality is...

381
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:43,557
healing magic is often looked down upon.

382
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,854
If you ever come across someone
with that kind of mindset...

383
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,942
beat them the hell up!

384
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,611
Resorting to violence already?!

385
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,282
Giving shallow people who can
only judge things at face value

386
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:03,327
a good beating will set them straight.

387
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,710
This journey to deliver letters

388
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:13,462
will change you, for better or worse.

389
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,306
I expect great things from you, Usato.

390
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,981
She expects great things from me, huh?

391
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,485
That makes me so happy...

392
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,778
Damn it!

393
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,490
<i>I know this might sound cliché...</i>

394
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,368
<i>but after all's said and done,</i>

395
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,035
<i>I really trust her.</i>

396
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,458
<i>As a mentor, I respect her.</i>

397
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:55,490
<i>I will continue to live in this world.</i>

398
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,715
<i>Together with her...</i>

399
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,134
<i>and the people of this kingdom.</i>

400
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,893
Good luck, Usato-kun!

401
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,977
I'm sure there will be
tough times ahead but--

402
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:14,690
Eat well, sleep well, and don't fret
when things don't go well!

403
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,691
Right...

404
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,918
Usato...

405
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,421
Amako.

406
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:39,006
I'll be right here with you.

407
00:21:42,176 --> 00:21:43,928
Please take care.

408
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,429
Thanks, we will!

409
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,890
We will bring back good news!

410
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,266
Celia.

411
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,519
I know. I believe in you!

412
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:54,355
Open the gates!

413
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,817
Now, off we go!

414
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,111
<i>Unknown countries.</i>

415
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,239
<i>Unknown people.</i>

416
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:07,034
<i>I wonder what's going to happen.</i>

417
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:41,193
Just where are you taking me?

418
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,384
Hey! Quit dawdling!

419
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,802
Y-yes, ma'am!

420
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,307
Usato-kun.

421
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,108
<i>The beginning of a journey,</i>

422
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,609
<i>visiting new places.</i>

423
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,028
<i>A grand adventure brimming
with mystery and danger.</i>

424
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:28,282
<i>There I was, having gotten
used to living in this world.</i>

425
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:30,285
<i>Swaying in the horse-drawn carriage,</i>

426
00:23:30,285 --> 00:23:33,787
<i>filled with thoughts of
the journey that lay ahead.</i>

427
