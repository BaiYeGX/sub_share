1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,670
The Demon Lord's Army
will make its move soon.

2
00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:08,799
Does that mean that war will break out?

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,092
Yes.

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:15,474
You will heal the injured
on the front lines with me.

5
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:18,143
In other words, you're
part of the advance guard.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,063
A-advance guard? Me?

7
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:25,608
But what about Tong and the others?
And weren't there other healers, too?

8
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,861
Yeah, we have two more healers,
but they have different roles.

9
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,375
The right man for the job.

10
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:34,617
B-but... to do what you do?

11
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:37,537
Well, we <i>do</i> still have
a little bit of time.

12
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,957
Steel yourself by then.

13
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:47,047
Will I be able to do that?

14
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:06,274
(The Wrong Way to Use Healing Magic)

15
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,694
<i>The walls that tower over you</i>

16
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,532
<i>are just so tall and thick.</i>

17
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:18,036
<i>They're not there to overwhelm you.</i>

18
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,291
<i>They're there for you to overcome.</i>

19
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,670
<i>That's what I believe.</i>

20
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:29,160
<i>For thousands of nights</i>

21
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,549
<i>and tens of thousands of mornings,</i>

22
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,718
<i>I can keep trying</i>

23
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,803
<i>without losing my way.</i>

24
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:38,055
<i>As long as I can arrive</i>

25
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:40,558
<i>at the final chapter,</i>

26
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:44,895
<i>it's okay even if</i>

27
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:46,063
<i>I'm scarred.</i>

28
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,733
<i>Stand! Up! Again!</i>

29
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,568
<i>Over and over!</i>

30
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,321
<i>Don't! Look! Back!</i>

31
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:56,366
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

32
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,578
<i>Only towards the future.</i>

33
00:02:17,294 --> 00:02:20,974
(#4 Usato, Rescue Squad Member!)

34
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,394
How is the Llinger Kingdom
invasion coming along?

35
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,654
It is all going according to plan.

36
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:32,277
All our units are preparing for battle.

37
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,614
We will soon be able to advance.

38
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,281
Good.

39
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:39,492
I leave you in command.

40
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:43,371
It might have been a close battle, but
they <i>did</i> manage to repel us before.

41
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:46,707
I don't expect you to fight to the death,
but you <i>will</i> give it your all, won't you?

42
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,460
That is a foregone conclusion.

43
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,380
What a boring response, Amila.

44
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,465
Whatever. You're dismissed.

45
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:55,884
Understood.

46
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,642
Oh? Was the big-shot Third
Army commander nervous

47
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:07,812
during a private audience
with the Demon Lord?

48
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:12,691
You should be working instead
of teasing me, Monster Doctor.

49
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,027
Quit it with that weird nickname.

50
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:18,031
Hyriluk already has a fine name!

51
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,077
And thanks for your concern, but
my work is going swimmingly.

52
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:26,498
The newest demon-modified
monster prototype is complete!

53
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,291
Wanna see?

54
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,419
Whatd'ya think?

55
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,588
Potent venom, a giant body,
and razor-sharp fangs!

56
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:38,635
Introducing Demon-Modified
Monster Prototype 72, Baljinak!

57
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,805
It has the same name as Prototype 71...

58
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,809
Didn't it go missing during the
last invasion of the Llinger Kingdom?

59
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,937
It was beaten by some enemy
army commander called Siglis

60
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,731
and ran off somewhere.

61
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,818
Worry not! Prototype 72 is even stronger!

62
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,445
I hope so.

63
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:02,242
There's an even bigger threat than
Siglis lurking in the Llinger Kingdom.

64
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:07,455
Are you talking about the group
known as "The Kidnappers"?

65
00:04:07,456 --> 00:04:08,873
I've heard the rumors.

66
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,124
That's right.

67
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,960
They don't fight despite
they're on the battlefield.

68
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,464
All they do is carry the wounded
back to the rear as fast as they can.

69
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:19,967
So, they minimize casualties?

70
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,180
That's not all. Their boss is a healer.

71
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,349
She scurries about the front lines
and heals injuries on the spot.

72
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,186
She's also an excellent fighter.

73
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,007
Annoyingly so.

74
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:35,650
That woman and my master go way back.

75
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,754
One day, I will kill her
with my own hands.

76
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,737
I see.

77
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:43,032
But in the next invasion,
you're in command.

78
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,075
No fighting for you.

79
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,660
I'm well aware.

80
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,997
I'll leave the front lines to that one.

81
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,832
The immortal dark magic user.

82
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,585
The Black Knight or whatever.

83
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,259
Nothing beats being in a bed!

84
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,764
I've even missed Tong's snores!

85
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,929
Hey! You awake?

86
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:16,053
It's breakfast time!

87
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:18,817
Found these in the dining room.

88
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,213
I <i>think</i> these are fruits...

89
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,200
Man, that looks good!

90
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,202
I'll have one, too!

91
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:31,755
These taste better than they look!

92
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,545
You greedy little pig!

93
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:44,970
Traitor! I haven't forgiven you for
taking advantage of my innocence!

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,609
So cute...

95
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,139
No, no, no!

96
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,918
I won't be fooled again!
No matter how cute you are!

97
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,319
All right! All right!
You can have some too!

98
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,242
I know, I know. You're cute, too.

99
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,160
Here you go, Blurin.

100
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,622
Blurin?

101
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,248
Rose-san!

102
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:16,417
Is that his name?

103
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,002
That's right.

104
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:21,505
It's a contraction of "Blue Grizzly."

105
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,091
Pretty ingenious, if I do say so myself.

106
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,626
You agree, right? Blurin?

107
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:32,475
B-Blurin-san? That's my hand you've
got in your mouth... it kinda hurts.

108
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:37,271
Name aside, I've informed
Lloyd-sama about that bear.

109
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,357
He's now property of the Rescue Squad.

110
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,026
P-property?

111
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,402
Yes, property.

112
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:48,700
He can stay here, but he'll
have to pull his own weight.

113
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,666
What do you expect him to do?

114
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,339
Why am I carrying him?

115
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,799
Aren't we running together?

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,719
This is practice for the real thing.

117
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,600
Think of that bear as someone
who's in need of rescue.

118
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,144
Someone who's in need of rescue?

119
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,562
Someone who's been injured.

120
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,229
Quit yapping and start running!

121
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:22,525
Y-yes ma'am! Here we go, Blurin!

122
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,862
All said and done, it's just
more weight than usual.

123
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:30,324
This is easy! All I have to
do is to ration my magic.

124
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,736
Pick up the pace! That
guy's not gonna make it!

125
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:37,707
I can't help it! He's heavy!

126
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,419
Comin' through!

127
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,464
What the hell are you guys doing?!

128
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,162
Big Sis didn't tell ya?

129
00:07:47,163 --> 00:07:50,105
We're simulatin' battlefield conditions!

130
00:07:50,106 --> 00:07:51,512
Mind your own business!

131
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:54,223
The others are hidin', too!

132
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,424
Best watch yer back!

133
00:07:56,425 --> 00:07:57,434
Damn it!

134
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,354
(One Hour Later)

135
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,112
What's this?! It stinks!

136
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,780
My special stinky water!

137
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,157
Why make something like that?!

138
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,119
(Three Hours Later)

139
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:18,080
(Four Hours Later)

140
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,458
Wait, I feel kinda...
(Four Hours Later)

141
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,713
You, too?!

142
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,760
That's weird...

143
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,722
What's going on...?!

144
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,856
Thanks!

145
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,900
I should be able to last for
half a day, no problem!

146
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,863
That's what your stamina's
like on the battlefield.

147
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:58,370
The human body also gets fatigued
from anxiety, fear, and frustration.

148
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,790
That's why you ran out of energy
much faster than normal.

149
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,375
Then, what can I--

150
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,710
Get used to it.

151
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,840
Build up your mental fortitude
and your situational awareness.

152
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,717
Thank you.

153
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,969
Once you've replenished your magic,

154
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,891
go run through town and around the
castle perimeter in the afternoon.

155
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,476
While carrying Blurin?

156
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,644
Did you have to ask?

157
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,608
Hey, look at that.

158
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,276
A Blue Grizzly?!

159
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,195
That's crazy!

160
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,197
<i>See, I knew this would happen.</i>

161
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:35,908
<i>Blurin is still a monster,
albeit a well-behaved one.</i>

162
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,118
<i>People are obviously going to make a fuss.</i>

163
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,537
Wait, isn't that...?

164
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,790
Oh, he's one of <i>them</i>.

165
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,834
What a relief.

166
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,127
What is it, Blurin?

167
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:59,097
Welcome!

168
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,475
How about some fresh fruits?

169
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,938
Sorry, I don't have any money.

170
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,523
What's this one called?

171
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:13,112
These are perles, our local specialty.

172
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:17,874
I have one more question,
if you don't mind.

173
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,955
I'm carrying a monster on my back,
but why is no one freaking out?

174
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,416
You're a member of the
Rescue Squad, aren't you?

175
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,377
Anyone can tell from that outfit.

176
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,420
Yeah, but...

177
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,880
Speaking of the Rescue Squad,

178
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,009
we have some rugged men
running through here all the time.

179
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:38,054
It's going to take more
than that to frighten us.

180
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,435
<i>I guess that's what happens when
you get used to those tough guys.</i>

181
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,315
Thank you! I'll come and buy
some fruit next time.

182
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,861
Here, have this. As a token of friendship.

183
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,066
Really? Are you sure?

184
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,432
Isn't that nice, Blurin?

185
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:00,391
Come on! Where are your manners?!

186
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:03,287
Thanks once again!

187
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:04,789
See you!

188
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,377
Was that guy from the Rescue Squad?

189
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,170
Looks like it.

190
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,048
What about him, Amako?

191
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,217
No, it's nothing.

192
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:26,728
If we're going to the castle perimeter,
might as well say hi to Kazuki and senpai.

193
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,730
What do you think, Blurin?

194
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,150
Yeah, you said it. Let's go!

195
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,366
I wonder if I can bring
Blurin into the castle.

196
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,905
It's where the king is...

197
00:11:41,906 --> 00:11:43,660
so they might refuse us entry.

198
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,996
Nah, Blurin is so cute,

199
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:49,105
we might be able to get in if
we say he's a big stuffed animal.

200
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,796
Huh? Are you all right?

201
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,884
How's that?

202
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:02,179
Much better.
Sorry about all this.

203
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,180
It's nothing.

204
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,433
Actually... were you trying
to get my attention?

205
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,812
Yup. I wanted to say hello to my junior.

206
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,814
I never yelled,
but I couldn't help myself.

207
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,358
Junior?

208
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:17,111
Huh? Didn't the captain tell you?

209
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:23,241
I'm Orga Fleur, one of the
Rescue Squad healers.

210
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,492
It's a pleasure.

211
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,749
I heard we got ourselves a new member.

212
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,961
To think he was summoned
together with the heroes.

213
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,463
It's true!

214
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:40,635
I've been training so hard everyday,
I've almost forgotten it all myself.

215
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:46,682
Usato-kun, it's amazing you're able to
keep up with the captain's training.

216
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,601
My sister and I weren't able to do it.

217
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,104
Sister?

218
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:53,773
The other healer?

219
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,568
She's five years younger than I am.

220
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:01,322
We run a clinic here in the castle town.

221
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,309
Using healing magic, we treat the people.

222
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,830
Wait... but didn't you collapse just now?

223
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:11,331
Oh, that?

224
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:15,650
I'm not good at healing myself,

225
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:18,338
but I can heal others just fine.

226
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,092
There are all kinds of healers, huh?

227
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:26,388
There are, but we're all part of
the Rescue Squad just the same.

228
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,643
In times of crisis, we heed the
captain and heal the wounded.

229
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,352
Times of crisis...

230
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:37,984
You will heal the injured
on the front lines with me.

231
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,029
In other words, you're
part of the advance guard.

232
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:46,909
What are your roles on the battlefield?

233
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:53,749
Let's see... first, Tong and the others
retrieve the injured from the front lines.

234
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,127
Then, my sister and I treat them.

235
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,380
You could say that we're rear support.

236
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,006
To tell you the truth...

237
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,267
I'm going to be on the
front lines with Rose.

238
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,136
You serious?!

239
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,220
I am.

240
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,806
Do you think I'll be
able to pull that off?

241
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:10,975
Someone like me?

242
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:19,817
The ones in most danger on the
front lines are the heroes and knights.

243
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:27,949
If they get injured, all
that awaits them is death.

244
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,826
But with healers
on the front lines as well,

245
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:35,248
they can be saved.

246
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:39,670
It's dangerous. And it's tough.

247
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:44,050
It's not a job that she'll entrust
to someone halfheartedly.

248
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,718
Not the captain.

249
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,015
Now then... it's about time
I got back to the clinic.

250
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,600
Otherwise, my sister
is going to yell at me.

251
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,896
R-right. I'll continue with my training.

252
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,274
I'm glad I was able to
talk to you, Usato-kun.

253
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,693
Just one more thing?

254
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,319
What is it?

255
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,864
Don't hate Rose too much, okay?

256
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:10,742
She doesn't mince words.

257
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,984
And... she's rather blunt, so...

258
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:15,084
Don't worry.

259
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,620
I've never hated her.

260
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:20,794
Though, I <i>do</i> have a
few choice words for her.

261
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:21,920
See you later!

262
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,339
All right, until later.

263
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,053
So, you've finally found him. Rose-san.

264
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,556
There you are, onii-chan!

265
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,600
Wandering off by yourself?
Do you have a death wish?

266
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,146
Come on, I'm not <i>that</i> frail!

267
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,314
What's with that look?

268
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,874
More importantly, I met
someone really interesting.

269
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,987
Really? What kind of person?

270
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,699
You'll meet him, too. Eventually.

271
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:52,622
You'll like him. I'm sure of it.

272
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,932
Excuse me, I'd like to enter.

273
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,833
Can this kid enter, too?

274
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,456
Usato-dono of the Rescue Squad?

275
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:05,205
That Blue Grizzly can enter, no problem.

276
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:09,259
You can bring monsters
into the castle? Really?

277
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Yes, really.

278
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:14,181
Rose-sama has signed
off on it. Please, go ahead.

279
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,517
Thank you!

280
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,853
<i>They trust Rose way too much around here.</i>

281
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:21,396
Get in there!

282
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,689
Yes, sir!

283
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:25,151
You! You're leaving yourself wide open!

284
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,537
Well, if it isn't Usato-kun!

285
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,010
Over here!

286
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,712
What's that fuzzy blue thing?

287
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,424
This kid? He's a Blue Grizzly cub.

288
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:54,221
Get this. I had to survive in a
forest filled with monsters,

289
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,694
and it was there that...

290
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:59,184
Hey, are you listening, Inukami-senpai?

291
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,812
U-Usato-kun!

292
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:06,566
Can I pet him?

293
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:10,362
Sure. Go ahead, he won't bite.

294
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,948
Even if he <i>does</i> bite, I'll heal you.

295
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,458
That doesn't inspire confidence.

296
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:19,622
But I <i>am</i> a heroine,
so animals should...

297
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,922
H-he doesn't do well with new
people, so don't feel too bad.

298
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,786
I don't feel bad at all!

299
00:17:29,787 --> 00:17:32,786
The feeling of those paw pads took me
by surprise and got me all excited!

300
00:17:32,787 --> 00:17:34,678
I see...

301
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,432
Why don't you try calling his name?
Then, I'm sure he'll let you pet him.

302
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,601
By the way, his name is Blurin.

303
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,277
That's a pretty nice name!

304
00:17:44,278 --> 00:17:47,230
Let's be friends, Blurin!

305
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:53,655
M-maybe he thinks you're a bad person...

306
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,326
H-hey, Blurin! Let's leave it at that.

307
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:03,039
I guess this means
you're a bad person, too!

308
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,167
Looks like it.

309
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:09,964
Thinking about it, it certainly has
been a while since we last met.

310
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,008
It has, hasn't it?

311
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,427
Senpai, your hand!

312
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,444
Oh, this? It's nothing serious.

313
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:20,307
I just got a bit too serious
about sword fighting practice.

314
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:22,810
We need to treat that.

315
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,442
There, good as new.

316
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:31,943
That's amazing.

317
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:34,279
This is nothing.

318
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,118
Usato-kun, did you come
here today just to see me?

319
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,330
Yup! Both you and Kazuki.

320
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:46,301
Your honesty hurts.

321
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,418
Forget I said that.

322
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:50,920
Kazuki isn't here today.

323
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,050
He's probably left the kingdom by now.

324
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:58,345
To get some combat
experience fighting monsters.

325
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,971
He's with Siglis and the others.

326
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:05,639
Siglis-san. Is the Demon Lord's Army
really going to start invading soon?

327
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,803
It is.

328
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:11,693
Probably with a much stronger
formation than last time.

329
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,739
That is why we have both
you and Suzune-sama.

330
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,368
You heroes are sure to
boost our troops' morale.

331
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:23,162
We're sure to win!

332
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,582
We will indeed.

333
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,001
I'll give it my all, too.

334
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,046
Hung Wolves!

335
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,549
Kazuki-sama!

336
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,427
Roger!

337
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,019
I wonder if he'll be all right.

338
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,475
Well, it'll only be for a few days.

339
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:50,021
Once he comes back, it'll be my turn.

340
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,607
I can't wait.

341
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:55,072
You'll probably enjoy every minute of it.

342
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:57,112
I can just picture you now.

343
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,115
It wouldn't kill you to worry
about me a little, would it?

344
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,279
Oh, I'm so worried!

345
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,245
You didn't mean it!

346
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,837
All right, I'd better get going.

347
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,919
Good luck with your training.

348
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,964
Same to you!

349
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:16,966
See you!

350
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,263
<i>Usato-kun. You don't
tiptoe around me anymore.</i>

351
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,672
<i>Have you noticed?</i>

352
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,103
<i>Oh, well. It's not like
you're mean or anything.</i>

353
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,729
<i>Kazuki's training.</i>

354
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,358
<i>Senpai's doing her best.</i>

355
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,028
<i>All because the battle
is fast approaching.</i>

356
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:42,032
<i>If they're going to fight,
I want to do something, too.</i>

357
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,786
<i>I don't want to be the only
one wallowing in safety.</i>

358
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,624
<i>In my previous world, I could only
wish to do the things I couldn't.</i>

359
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,170
<i>That's not who I am anymore!</i>

360
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,056
Goodnight, Blurin.

361
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,694
Usato, it's you.

362
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,572
How's training?
Has your body gotten used to it?

363
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:25,283
Well... a little.

364
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,368
But I'd like to train
a little more just in case.

365
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,039
I see. Then continue.

366
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,956
I will.

367
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,179
Hey, Rose-san.

368
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:39,299
About what you told me yesterday...

369
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,217
About having to steel myself?

370
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:49,432
Yesterday, I almost died in
a fight with a snake monster.

371
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,353
Hearing about the Demon
Lord's Army right after that

372
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,647
got me pretty freaked out.

373
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,648
I thought...

374
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,194
that I'd rather not join
the war if I didn't have to.

375
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:04,615
But today, I felt something
more strongly than that.

376
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,369
I will not fight.

377
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:09,765
Okay.

378
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,121
I will not kill any enemies, either.

379
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,539
Okay.

380
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,960
But I <i>will</i> save Kazuki
and Inukami-senpai and...

381
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:20,009
everyone only I can save.

382
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,802
That's because I'm a member
of the Rescue Squad.

383
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,615
That's more than enough.

384
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,605
We pride ourselves on saving people.

385
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:41,568
Drag the self-sacrificing
back kicking and screaming.

386
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:45,489
Swoop in and save those
who are about to be killed.

387
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,660
Do everything you can to revive
those on the brink of death.

388
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:50,329
That is what we do.

389
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,245
Speak your ideals.

390
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:55,652
For that is what the
Rescue Squad is all about.

391
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,131
Yes, Captain!

392
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,965
At that moment...

393
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,426
for the very first time...

394
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,470
I felt like a true member
of the Rescue Squad.

395
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,449
Wake up.

396
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,785
We received a message
from Lloyd-sama yesterday.

397
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,996
You're wanted.

398
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,582
Why didn't you tell me yesterday?

399
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:42,003
He wants you to join
Hero Suzune's training.

400
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:44,173
Inukami-senpai's training?

401
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,008
Ready!
