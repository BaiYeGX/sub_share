1
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,603
{\an8}<i>I lost the instant teleportation stone.</i>

2
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:17,814
{\an8}<i>I don't have the time to look for it.</i>

3
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:20,024
{\an8}<i>I'll have to defeat them all,</i>

4
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:22,485
{\an8}<i>otherwise, I can't make it out alive.</i>

5
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:29,075
<i>My body is exhausted.</i>

6
00:00:29,576 --> 00:00:31,119
<i>I can't use Stealth or Murderous Intent.</i>

7
00:00:33,913 --> 00:00:34,873
<i>But even so,</i>

8
00:00:35,623 --> 00:00:36,875
<i>I cannot give up.</i>

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,878
<i>I must…</i>

10
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:41,463
<i>survive!</i>

11
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:51,681
<i>I've always been the weakest.</i>

12
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:54,267
<i>I understand the miserableness
better than anyone else.</i>

13
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,145
<i>But still, I couldn't help
but desire to climb to the top.</i>

14
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:13,995
That kid has a nickname,
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

15
00:01:16,372 --> 00:01:18,792
The weakest? Not the strongest?

16
00:01:20,668 --> 00:01:21,711
The weakest.

17
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:24,589
He was even injured
in an E-rank dungeon and hospitalized.

18
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:27,634
He's probably the weakest hunter.

19
00:01:29,886 --> 00:01:32,096
Sung. That's enough.

20
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,640
Don't push yourself anymore.

21
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:35,934
That's right, Jinwoo.

22
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:38,144
It's better to give up now.

23
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:43,483
It's your own fault.

24
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:50,532
Why do you always love to take risks?

25
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:54,035
As an E-rank hunter, you should be content

26
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:56,538
to have grown this much.

27
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,164
Shouldn't you?

28
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:00,291
Jinwoo.

29
00:03:33,718 --> 00:03:36,638
The third Jeju Island raid mission.

30
00:03:36,721 --> 00:03:40,433
At that time,
I was already unable to fight,

31
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:42,393
so I couldn't participate.

32
00:03:43,436 --> 00:03:45,396
You participated, right?

33
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,192
Yes. My mission was to relay orders
and be on the outer guard.

34
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:52,695
There were many casualties.

35
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:56,950
Those who returned alive
have indelible traumas.

36
00:03:58,534 --> 00:04:02,205
Any hunter would have such experiences.

37
00:04:03,414 --> 00:04:05,917
However, if we cannot overcome the trauma,

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,085
what awaits us

39
00:04:07,585 --> 00:04:09,128
is death.

40
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:13,091
By the way, is this person really me?

41
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:15,093
I seem completely different.

42
00:04:15,677 --> 00:04:17,679
Not only taller, but also stronger.

43
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:19,138
I seem very strong.

44
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:22,642
But the change is only on the outside.

45
00:04:22,725 --> 00:04:24,852
I am still weak inside.

46
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,063
I am about to lose my life again.

47
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:34,404
E-rank Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

48
00:04:34,904 --> 00:04:36,698
This is what you are.

49
00:04:37,824 --> 00:04:39,742
Reckless and unaware of your position.

50
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:41,452
Shut up.

51
00:04:55,258 --> 00:04:56,467
You have a long way to go.

52
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:59,345
You talked about your realization
to act cool.

53
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,888
That's why you ended up like this.

54
00:05:01,472 --> 00:05:04,350
You are the one who kills yourself.

55
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:08,438
<i>In the end… nothing changed?</i>

56
00:05:09,814 --> 00:05:10,857
<i>Just like that time.</i>

57
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:16,279
<i>What happened after that?</i>

58
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:19,407
<i>Eh?</i>

59
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:24,120
<i>This quest is over?</i>

60
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,789
Is this what
"Luck is also a strength" means?

61
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,419
It seems that
it doesn't want you to die here.

62
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,087
See you next time.

63
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:46,934
{\an8}This is

64
00:05:47,894 --> 00:05:49,270
{\an8}the Penalty Zone.

65
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:53,357
{\an8}I remember now.

66
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:56,027
{\an8}I haven't completed my daily quest today.

67
00:05:58,237 --> 00:05:59,906
No matter what…

68
00:06:02,784 --> 00:06:04,202
nice timing.

69
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:06,496
Thanks to this, I survived.

70
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,207
<i>It wishes me good luck?</i>

71
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,668
<i>It means that the quest is hard enough
to wish me good luck.</i>

72
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,714
<i>Or maybe it wants to cheer me on.</i>

73
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:18,508
<i>Whatever.</i>

74
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:19,467
Store.

75
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:24,013
<i>This is the first time
my fatigue level has exceeded 90.</i>

76
00:06:33,523 --> 00:06:34,982
{\an8}<i>In a critical state,</i>

77
00:06:35,066 --> 00:06:37,944
{\an8}<i>even potions can't restore HP?</i>

78
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:40,613
<i>I'll have to let it recover naturally</i>

79
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:43,282
<i>or automatically when I level up.</i>

80
00:06:44,826 --> 00:06:47,453
It seems I worried for nothing.

81
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:54,085
<i>"See you next time"?</i>

82
00:06:55,503 --> 00:06:56,712
<i>Sure.</i>

83
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,756
<i>If I can survive, let's meet again.</i>

84
00:06:59,632 --> 00:07:01,676
<i>If you can't kill me,</i>

85
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,970
<i>this pain</i>

86
00:07:04,053 --> 00:07:05,972
<i>will only make me stronger.</i>

87
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:23,781
I had a strange dream.

88
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,995
Brother is still not back?

89
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:32,665
Is he working this late?

90
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,335
Maybe he has a girlfriend?

91
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:38,504
That's impossible.

92
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:42,383
I told him there'd be
a parent-teacher meeting today.

93
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:44,969
He should come in time.

94
00:07:50,892 --> 00:07:53,769
It's great that I can recover
when leveling up.

95
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:57,440
There's over ten minutes left.

96
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,985
I'll use the time to prepare my equipment.

97
00:08:04,572 --> 00:08:05,406
Purchase.

98
00:08:10,953 --> 00:08:12,371
Knight Killer.

99
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:15,333
Increases damage
to armor-type monsters by 25%.

100
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,460
It's expensive but useful.

101
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:20,046
Next is this one.

102
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:22,798
The rune stone I obtained
when I killed Igris.

103
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:25,510
This should also be useful.

104
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:39,982
"Ruler's Hand."

105
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:43,069
A skill that doesn't consume mana?
Seems quite handy.

106
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,405
It can physically manipulate objects
without touching them.

107
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,367
<i>Like that move?</i>

108
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:58,501
I can't move objects that are too large.

109
00:09:00,711 --> 00:09:02,964
That's probably all the preparations
I can make.

110
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,135
The rest is up to luck.

111
00:09:16,227 --> 00:09:19,605
A few hours apart and your numbers
have increased a lot.

112
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:29,240
Approaching the Jeju Island
air defense zone.

113
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,575
Understood.

114
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:32,785
Sorry.

115
00:09:32,868 --> 00:09:35,413
This must be very uncomfortable for you.

116
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:37,415
No. I'm fine.

117
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,461
Although I wasn't a hunter yet
during the third Jeju Island raid,

118
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:45,798
I can understand your feelings.

119
00:09:45,881 --> 00:09:48,134
I'm grateful to hear that.

120
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:51,053
Mr. Choi. A faint mana reaction
has been detected at sea.

121
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:52,513
Please check the screen.

122
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:57,852
This is…

123
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,109
<i>This Knight Killer is quite useful.</i>

124
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:07,069
<i>Much better than fighting with bare hands.</i>

125
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:10,156
<i>But… What's with this strange feeling?</i>

126
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:12,491
<i>I've defeated so many,
yet there's no progress at all.</i>

127
00:10:12,575 --> 00:10:14,702
<i>There's no sign of leveling up.</i>

128
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:16,162
<i>Moreover,</i>

129
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:18,956
<i>what is that mage doing?</i>

130
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,834
<i>He's been chanting spells,
but not launching any attacks at me.</i>

131
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,336
<i>Only these knights are attacking.</i>

132
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,129
<i>What are they doing?</i>

133
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:28,799
<i>The gate. Is it summoning magic?</i>

134
00:10:28,883 --> 00:10:32,303
<i>These knights are summoned as weapons.</i>

135
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,181
<i>So even if I defeat them,
I won't earn any points.</i>

136
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:37,099
<i>My target should be</i>

137
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,476
<i>the mages</i>

138
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,644
<i>which means you!</i>

139
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:47,443
I was right.

140
00:10:48,361 --> 00:10:49,820
The target should be the mages.

141
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:51,906
Since I figured this out…

142
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:54,575
<i>Five left.</i>

143
00:10:59,121 --> 00:11:00,122
<i>Four left.</i>

144
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:19,850
How long do you plan to hide behind them?

145
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:26,941
<i>Three to go.</i>

146
00:11:34,448 --> 00:11:35,282
<i>A golem?</i>

147
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:54,760
<i>You are collecting the knights' power
to summon a powerful beast.</i>

148
00:11:55,886 --> 00:11:58,639
<i>However, the fewer the knights,
the easier it is to find you.</i>

149
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:17,575
The mage who summoned you disappeared.

150
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:20,536
So you should

151
00:12:21,704 --> 00:12:24,790
go to hell!

152
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:52,109
It's over.

153
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,403
What's next?

154
00:12:55,154 --> 00:12:57,198
The more points obtained,

155
00:12:57,281 --> 00:13:00,826
the higher the chance of changing
to a high-ranked job.

156
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:04,371
The system will analyze
the player's actions in the quest

157
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:06,165
and assign a corresponding job.

158
00:13:06,248 --> 00:13:07,416
Can't I choose for myself?

159
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,344
Eh? What does this mean?

160
00:13:33,651 --> 00:13:35,819
{\an8}"Shadow army"?

161
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:40,533
Wait a minute, what's this?

162
00:13:40,616 --> 00:13:43,369
This… is my job?

163
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,996
"Necromancer"?

164
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,414
Hold on…

165
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:50,209
My intelligence has hardly developed.

166
00:13:50,292 --> 00:13:51,585
How can this be?

167
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:56,799
<i>A necromancer is a magical profession
capable of summoning undead beasts</i>

168
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:58,342
<i>and controlling them in battle.</i>

169
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:02,846
<i>I am an assassin-type hunter
with a close-quarters combat style.</i>

170
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:05,474
<i>My improvements focused on strength,</i>

171
00:14:05,558 --> 00:14:06,809
<i>my skills too.</i>

172
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:09,853
<i>If I change my job to a necromancer,
a back-line profession,</i>

173
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:11,689
<i>all the abilities I've gained
will be useless.</i>

174
00:14:13,023 --> 00:14:14,650
Yes or no?

175
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,235
So I can reject it?

176
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:20,281
<i>Changing to a necromancer is too risky,
and the reward is uncertain.</i>

177
00:14:20,948 --> 00:14:21,782
No.

178
00:14:23,284 --> 00:14:24,702
<i>"Hidden class"?</i>

179
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,587
<i>Does this mean the profession
has special abilities?</i>

180
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:38,716
Necromancer.

181
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,926
If only I could experience
its abilities first.

182
00:14:44,805 --> 00:14:46,181
<i>Summoning magic.</i>

183
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:47,600
<i>That's right.</i>

184
00:14:47,683 --> 00:14:53,480
<i>The summoning magic used by these mages
resembles a necromancer's abilities.</i>

185
00:14:54,064 --> 00:14:58,777
<i>And all my battles here
are like a review of past battles.</i>

186
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,115
<i>The sound of "job change"
made me think I had a choice.</i>

187
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:04,742
<i>But it was all prearranged?</i>

188
00:15:05,284 --> 00:15:06,702
<i>Is the system playing tricks?</i>

189
00:15:07,912 --> 00:15:09,079
<i>But it's quite interesting.</i>

190
00:15:09,663 --> 00:15:12,124
<i>These mages had no combat ability,</i>

191
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,001
<i>but I do.</i>

192
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:18,172
{\an8}<i>No one says necromancers
can't fight on the front lines.</i>

193
00:15:18,255 --> 00:15:20,591
{\an8}<i>If the profession is part
of the ability stats,</i>

194
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:23,677
{\an8}<i>it will be strengthened
with leveling up like the skills.</i>

195
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:28,015
{\an8}<i>And the shadow army
may also grow stronger.</i>

196
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:29,600
<i>This means…</i>

197
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:32,353
<i>From now on,
it won't be just me leveling up.</i>

198
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,521
Well then.

199
00:15:40,903 --> 00:15:42,029
Please.

200
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:43,280
Thank you.

201
00:15:47,534 --> 00:15:49,244
It's almost dawn.

202
00:15:49,828 --> 00:15:53,165
Hunter Choi and the others should
be arriving on the island soon.

203
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,418
Sorry for keeping you up so late.

204
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:57,378
It's nothing.

205
00:15:57,878 --> 00:16:02,549
Now that you've stayed,
are you up for a chat?

206
00:17:00,983 --> 00:17:02,568
<i>"Shadow monarch"?</i>

207
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,820
<i>I got a second job change?</i>

208
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:06,989
<i>Did I get so many points?</i>

209
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,910
{\an8}<i>Acquired job skills
and ten ability points.</i>

210
00:17:11,994 --> 00:17:13,370
<i>I also received a title.</i>

211
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,248
<i>Since the reward has been delivered,</i>

212
00:17:16,331 --> 00:17:17,791
<i>does that mean this quest is over?</i>

213
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,586
<i>So… I've completed the job change?</i>

214
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:25,632
<i>I can hear them making sounds like screams</i>

215
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:29,053
<i>as if expressing their pain.</i>

216
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:31,430
<i>"Shadow Extraction."</i>

217
00:17:33,682 --> 00:17:35,476
A command word…

218
00:17:39,772 --> 00:17:40,814
Arise.

219
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,126
This is amazing.

220
00:18:02,044 --> 00:18:06,256
<i>"Exclusive skill Shadow Extraction…
and Shadow Storage"?</i>

221
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:09,802
<i>I can extract mana
and create shadow soldiers</i>

222
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:13,097
<i>and summon or absorb them anytime.</i>

223
00:18:13,931 --> 00:18:16,600
<i>So they are the shadow soldiers?</i>

224
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:22,314
<i>Their postmortem interval and strength
will affect the skill's failure rate.</i>

225
00:18:22,397 --> 00:18:23,982
<i>I should take note of that.</i>

226
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:27,027
<i>Besides knights, there are also mages.</i>

227
00:18:27,111 --> 00:18:29,196
<i>They even have their own levels.</i>

228
00:18:31,406 --> 00:18:34,701
<i>If I could extract A-rank
or S-rank shadows</i>

229
00:18:34,785 --> 00:18:38,539
<i>and their abilities stats
are the same as before their death…</i>

230
00:18:48,465 --> 00:18:49,424
Okay.

231
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:53,095
There is a limit to the number
of soldiers I can keep.

232
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,597
Eleven shadow soldiers,
extraction released.

233
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,184
Sorry for waking you up.

234
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:01,770
All right.

235
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:04,439
<i>Blood-Red Commander Igris.</i>

236
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:07,234
<i>If I could bring him under my command…</i>

237
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:09,695
Arise.

238
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:20,080
<i>What?</i>

239
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,419
Is this the situation mentioned earlier?

240
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:28,255
Two more times.

241
00:19:32,968 --> 00:19:33,802
Arise.

242
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,726
Damn.

243
00:19:41,351 --> 00:19:43,395
I don't have to explain.

244
00:19:43,478 --> 00:19:46,690
As hunters, without a second awakening,

245
00:19:46,773 --> 00:19:50,235
our abilities will stay
the same in our lifetime.

246
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,405
That's why we practice martial arts
and call upon companions.

247
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:56,366
Are you waiting for your king to return?

248
00:19:57,284 --> 00:19:59,494
The king who may not return at all.

249
00:20:00,662 --> 00:20:01,997
Commander Igris.

250
00:20:02,497 --> 00:20:03,790
You are a warrior.

251
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,044
Wielding your sword against enemies
must be your inner desire.

252
00:20:08,212 --> 00:20:11,673
Do you want to let your sword
rust in such a desolate place?

253
00:20:13,842 --> 00:20:16,428
If you need someone
to wield your sword for,

254
00:20:17,262 --> 00:20:18,263
fight for me.

255
00:20:19,348 --> 00:20:21,975
Don't guard that empty throne.

256
00:20:22,643 --> 00:20:24,645
Protect me, who stand before you.

257
00:20:25,812 --> 00:20:26,647
Arise.

258
00:20:39,826 --> 00:20:40,911
<i>But,</i>

259
00:20:41,745 --> 00:20:43,872
I too occasionally dream of…

260
00:20:56,343 --> 00:21:01,682
…the awakened that keeps
appearing in this world.

261
00:21:03,141 --> 00:21:04,309
Isn't that obvious?

262
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:06,645
Igris.

263
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,607
This is your name.

264
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:13,402
{\an8}<i>I hope that among them,</i>

265
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:20,409
{\an8}<i>there will be one who possesses
a power with the brilliance of hope.</i>

266
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:23,912
<i>Perhaps he is awakening
at this very moment.</i>

267
00:21:39,177 --> 00:21:40,554
Nice to meet you.

268
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:23,031
Mr. Choi. What is this?

269
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:24,324
I don't know either.

270
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:27,536
As far as I know,
such a thing shouldn't be here.

271
00:23:28,078 --> 00:23:30,455
However, it appears to be…

272
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,167
They have evolved.
