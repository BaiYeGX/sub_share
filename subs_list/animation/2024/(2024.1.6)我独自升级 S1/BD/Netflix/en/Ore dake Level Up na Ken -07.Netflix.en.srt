1
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:35,683
Excuse me, Chief Woo.

2
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:37,769
What is it?

3
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:39,479
Please take a look at this.

4
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:44,025
This is a report on the C-rank dungeon
in which six hunters died.

5
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:46,694
The survivors are a D-rank hunter
and an E-rank hunter.

6
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:48,363
They must have escaped.

7
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:49,864
It happens all the time.

8
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:51,950
No, they didn't escape,

9
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,993
they got away by killing
the boss in the dungeon.

10
00:01:54,994 --> 00:01:59,040
The D-rank hunter Yoo Jinho
had quite expensive equipment.

11
00:01:59,124 --> 00:02:00,375
It's not necessarily impossible--

12
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:01,751
What are you trying to say?

13
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:04,337
Investigate it yourself
if you think it's suspicious.

14
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,588
No…

15
00:02:05,672 --> 00:02:10,844
One of the survivors
is the survivor from the double dungeon,

16
00:02:10,927 --> 00:02:12,720
Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

17
00:02:13,304 --> 00:02:14,180
Sung Jinwoo?

18
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:23,523
And one of the six who died
is Hunter Hwang Dongsuk.

19
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:28,194
The brother of Hunter Hwang Dongsoo?

20
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:31,239
Then it is indeed concerning…

21
00:02:33,074 --> 00:02:34,117
I'm back.

22
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,451
Welcome home.

23
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:37,912
A gift?

24
00:02:37,996 --> 00:02:39,372
It's fried chicken.

25
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:40,582
Did something good happen?

26
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm not sure if it's a good thing.

27
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:47,922
I've saved up for Mom's medical bills
and our living expenses.

28
00:02:48,673 --> 00:02:51,467
My stingy brother
is actually spending money.

29
00:02:53,177 --> 00:02:54,178
Oh, right.

30
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:57,807
What happened last time?

31
00:02:58,808 --> 00:02:59,642
The raid mission.

32
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:01,477
They paid you a lot, right?

33
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:03,855
But you didn't seem to have any injuries.

34
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:06,399
Your companions must have been strong.

35
00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:12,196
Well, yeah.

36
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,074
You guys killed the enemies easily, right?

37
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,869
<i>Yes, easily.</i>

38
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:20,163
<i>Regardless of the difference in strength,</i>

39
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:25,293
<i>at that moment, I had no hesitation.</i>

40
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:29,422
<i>I even despised them.</i>

41
00:03:30,757 --> 00:03:33,801
<i>If it were the old me,
I would have tried to run away.</i>

42
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,013
<i>Has my bravery increased with my level?</i>

43
00:03:38,056 --> 00:03:40,266
<i>But my opponents weren't magic beasts.</i>

44
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,434
<i>They were people.</i>

45
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:43,978
Brother?

46
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:46,272
Are you okay?

47
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:50,318
I thought the clerk didn't give me
the change, but I was mistaken.

48
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:51,527
What?

49
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:53,905
Seriously, don't scare me.

50
00:03:59,035 --> 00:04:00,453
<i>Don't think about that now.</i>

51
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:03,164
<i>I must keep getting
stronger for my family.</i>

52
00:04:03,248 --> 00:04:04,082
<i>And I mustn't die.</i>

53
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,252
<i>If the same thing happens again,
I will do just the same.</i>

54
00:04:09,712 --> 00:04:10,755
<i>What is this?</i>

55
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:12,090
<i>"A harmful substance…"</i>

56
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,010
<i>It's detoxifying me?</i>

57
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:21,140
I'm full.

58
00:04:23,017 --> 00:04:23,977
You're done eating?

59
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,478
Then I'll eat it all up.

60
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:27,939
Then don't complain about getting fat.

61
00:04:39,534 --> 00:04:40,827
I can't get drunk at all.

62
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:44,914
The system's special ability
has broken down the alcohol.

63
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:46,958
Is it the effect of some skill?

64
00:04:49,335 --> 00:04:50,586
"Blessing…"

65
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:52,797
"Health and longevity…"

66
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:58,094
"Injuries and immunity…"

67
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:00,596
This is it.

68
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,849
The reward for the double dungeon mission.

69
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:05,601
So much has happened,
so I never bothered to check.

70
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,397
<i>Is this why my limbs could regenerate?</i>

71
00:05:10,648 --> 00:05:12,692
There are many things I'm unclear about.

72
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,615
Brother.

73
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,826
Someone named Yoo Jinho called for you.

74
00:05:24,954 --> 00:05:25,788
I'll be right there.

75
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:29,876
You've had too much to drink.
Alcohol is poison to the body.

76
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,502
I'm fine.

77
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:36,799
Even if I became a doctor,
I wouldn't treat you.

78
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:40,636
Sorry for suddenly calling you out.

79
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,722
I didn't expect to see you again.

80
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:44,390
I'm really happy.

81
00:05:44,474 --> 00:05:46,601
You saved me after all, Jinwoo.

82
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:50,396
Thanks for giving me the magic gem too.
You helped a lot.

83
00:05:51,647 --> 00:05:53,024
And,

84
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:54,901
you didn't reveal what happened.

85
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,739
Well, they tried
to kill us first, didn't they?

86
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:01,407
It was self-defense.

87
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,827
So, why did you want me?

88
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:08,498
I plan to build an attack team--

89
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:09,540
I refuse.

90
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:11,834
Huh? Well…

91
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,002
At least hear me out first.

92
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:16,047
I'm not interested
in hanging out with a rich guy.

93
00:06:17,131 --> 00:06:19,133
Twenty missions! No…

94
00:06:19,217 --> 00:06:21,094
Just 19 missions!

95
00:06:21,177 --> 00:06:22,887
Nineteen missions?

96
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,472
You want to be a guild master?

97
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:26,766
Please let me finish first.

98
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:27,683
Please.

99
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:34,398
Go on then.

100
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:37,568
Yes.

101
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:40,613
As you speculated,

102
00:06:40,696 --> 00:06:43,491
I want to obtain a guild master's license.

103
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:45,284
And one of the conditions

104
00:06:45,368 --> 00:06:48,287
is to participate
in 20 raid missions as a hunter.

105
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:50,289
The last mission was my first one.

106
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:53,793
To take over the company,
I've studied hard.

107
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,795
I'm confident about the written exam.

108
00:06:55,878 --> 00:06:56,712
But…

109
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:58,422
The real combat…

110
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,552
Aren't you the second young master
of Yoojin Construction?

111
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,097
{\an8}I'm also doing this for our company.

112
00:07:06,597 --> 00:07:09,517
{\an8}Actually, my father
wants to establish a guild.

113
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,811
Yoojin Construction
wants to establish a guild?

114
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:12,979
Yes.

115
00:07:14,522 --> 00:07:19,444
<i>Dungeons are certainly dangerous,
but they contain many rare treasures.</i>

116
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:22,697
<i>Magic gems and mana crystals
are just a part of it.</i>

117
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:26,659
<i>The bodies of high-rank beasts
can be used as materials for equipment.</i>

118
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:31,247
<i>One can say that everything
in the dungeon can be monetized.</i>

119
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,835
You plan to have your own hunters conquer
the dungeons and take all the spoils,

120
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,670
so as to establish
a self-sufficient system?

121
00:07:37,753 --> 00:07:39,505
That's right.

122
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:42,300
My father plans to hire
an S-rank hunter to be the guild master

123
00:07:42,383 --> 00:07:44,343
and my brother as the vice-guild master

124
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:46,095
to run the guild like a company.

125
00:07:46,179 --> 00:07:47,346
An S-rank hunter?

126
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,348
There are only seven of them nationally.

127
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:50,266
Yes.

128
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:54,520
<i>Moreover, Min Byung-gu,
the only one who hasn't joined a guild,</i>

129
00:07:54,604 --> 00:07:55,855
<i>has already retired.</i>

130
00:07:55,938 --> 00:07:58,566
Are you planning
to poach from other guilds?

131
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,820
I advise you not to do that.

132
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:05,490
The guilds that you poach from
will give you trouble.

133
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:08,743
My brother is not one of the Awakened,
so he can't be the guild master.

134
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:12,371
So you want to gain experience
and become the guild master

135
00:08:12,455 --> 00:08:13,915
to compete with your brother?

136
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:17,919
If you want to hide your power
and participate in missions,

137
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,337
you will need companions.

138
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,881
Rather than teaming up
with high-ranked hunters,

139
00:08:21,964 --> 00:08:24,550
completing the raid missions
with an E-rank hunter

140
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:26,302
would be more convincing to my father.

141
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:29,972
<i>He is at least B-rank…</i>

142
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,225
<i>No, it might even be higher.</i>

143
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:35,061
{\an8}<i>Teaming up with the wrong one
could be fatal.</i>

144
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:36,229
{\an8}<i>But if it's him…</i>

145
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:41,609
Take a look at this.

146
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,530
This building is planned
to be the guild's office.

147
00:08:45,613 --> 00:08:47,949
It's currently valued at 30 billion.

148
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:52,161
This is the reward I am offering you.

149
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:55,998
<i>Thirty billion for 19 C-rank missions.</i>

150
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,459
<i>Before, I would have accepted right away.</i>

151
00:08:58,543 --> 00:08:59,377
<i>But…</i>

152
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:03,381
<i>If I'm the only one in the world who can
level up, that's a different story.</i>

153
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:08,344
<i>If I keep developing like this,
someday I will be S-rank…</i>

154
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:11,514
<i>No, maybe even higher than that.</i>

155
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:15,810
<i>In that case, 30 billion seems trivial.</i>

156
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:18,563
<i>More importantly, teaming up with people</i>

157
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:22,858
<i>without understanding
the impact of leveling up</i>

158
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:24,235
<i>is too risky.</i>

159
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,861
Sorry.

160
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,242
Please, wait.

161
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:34,078
As long as you help me,

162
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:36,414
I will keep this secret for you
for a lifetime.

163
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:53,723
I want the information
on those two survivors.

164
00:09:53,806 --> 00:09:55,600
Bring me their documents immediately.

165
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,645
Excuse me.

166
00:10:00,688 --> 00:10:01,981
I have brought the documents.

167
00:10:02,064 --> 00:10:02,898
Mr. Hwang.

168
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:08,195
My brother was killed.

169
00:10:10,865 --> 00:10:12,241
This has not been confirmed yet--

170
00:10:12,325 --> 00:10:13,284
The documents?

171
00:10:14,952 --> 00:10:16,370
Yes, right here.

172
00:10:17,455 --> 00:10:18,581
Laura,

173
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:21,125
what would happen
if I killed someone in another country?

174
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,085
Are you serious?

175
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:33,262
In a country with an extradition treaty
regarding hunter crimes,

176
00:10:33,346 --> 00:10:35,264
you would be prosecuted
under that country's laws.

177
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:37,767
But if there's no extradition treaty,

178
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:40,353
you would be subject
to the laws of our own country.

179
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:42,688
So…

180
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,565
Depending on negotiations
with the government,

181
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:46,067
there might be leniency.

182
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:49,820
Adjust my schedule.

183
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:53,407
A sudden change of schedule
will affect the operation of the guild.

184
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:55,409
What's my schedule like?

185
00:10:55,993 --> 00:10:57,536
It's fully booked for now.

186
00:10:58,663 --> 00:11:01,165
Then clear it for later.

187
00:11:01,248 --> 00:11:02,333
I understand.

188
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,460
I will arrange it.

189
00:11:05,378 --> 00:11:07,588
{\an8}D-rank Hunter Yoo Jinho.

190
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:10,716
{\an8}E-rank Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

191
00:11:13,886 --> 00:11:17,556
Don't die before then.

192
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:25,314
It's rare to see you exercising.

193
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:29,110
Studying all the time
is harmful to health, right?

194
00:11:29,985 --> 00:11:31,612
Not because you had
too much fried chicken?

195
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:40,079
Hey.

196
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:42,373
If you had 30 billion, what would you do?

197
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:44,083
Why are you asking?

198
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,459
Just a random question.

199
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,047
Pay Mom's medical bills
and college tuition fees.

200
00:11:50,131 --> 00:11:51,132
And the rest?

201
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,009
Save it up.

202
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:56,387
I don't know. That's too much money.

203
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,223
That's true.

204
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:01,809
Just keep up at your own pace.

205
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:04,145
Wait, brother!

206
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,317
Even as an E-rank one,
he is still a hunter.

207
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:15,739
Yes…

208
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:17,867
No, don't check.

209
00:12:19,577 --> 00:12:20,953
Eleven kilometers?

210
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:24,540
Why are the numbers exceeding
the goal also recorded?

211
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,796
I see.

212
00:12:31,547 --> 00:12:33,507
Then let's see how far I can go.

213
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:39,180
Brother…

214
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:41,557
I finally caught up.

215
00:12:42,349 --> 00:12:43,851
I'll have another lap.

216
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,444
It stopped at twice the goal.

217
00:12:53,527 --> 00:12:54,737
Then the rest…

218
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:05,998
The daily quest became the secret quest.

219
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:07,833
Yes.

220
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:11,712
{\an8}I can choose different boxes.

221
00:13:12,379 --> 00:13:15,674
{\an8}Guess I'll choose Blessed Random Loot Box.

222
00:13:30,314 --> 00:13:31,398
A key again?

223
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:35,986
{\an8}"The Demon's Castle…"

224
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,821
{\an8}Acquisition difficulty of an S-rank?!

225
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:48,916
"Cures all illnesses with powerful magic."

226
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:51,293
"Elixir of Life."

227
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:05,015
<i>If that Elixir of Life
can really cure all illnesses…</i>

228
00:14:07,184 --> 00:14:08,310
<i>Then of course…</i>

229
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:20,698
<i>If the acquisition difficulty of the key
is proportional to the dungeon's,</i>

230
00:14:20,781 --> 00:14:22,491
<i>I am opening an S-rank dungeon.</i>

231
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:24,493
<i>If so,</i>

232
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:27,413
<i>what awaits me inside will be magic beasts</i>

233
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:30,416
<i>similar to those on Jeju Island
that even S-rank hunters can't handle.</i>

234
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:42,052
<i>With my current strength,</i>

235
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,847
<i>can I deal with beasts of that level?</i>

236
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:52,730
<i>It'd be a lie to say I'm not scared.</i>

237
00:14:54,148 --> 00:14:55,733
<i>If things don't go well,</i>

238
00:14:55,816 --> 00:14:58,777
<i>I will use this teleportation stone
I got from the Instance dungeon.</i>

239
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:08,621
<i>If I give up, everything is over.</i>

240
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:12,666
<i>I need to become stronger,
to level up even higher.</i>

241
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,168
<i>I must take back everything.</i>

242
00:15:16,253 --> 00:15:18,756
How could I die here?

243
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,529
I can hardly inflict any damage.

244
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:45,032
The gap is still so huge
after I use the title skills?

245
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:52,873
No use.

246
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:25,572
<i>A warning?</i>

247
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,450
<i>A third of my HP was gone in an instant.</i>

248
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,209
{\an8}<i>All abilities doubled?</i>

249
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:42,548
<i>So fast…</i>

250
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:48,387
<i>Only a half left?</i>

251
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,348
There's no other way.

252
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:52,474
Full Recovery!

253
00:16:58,105 --> 00:16:59,481
I stabbed it.

254
00:17:43,901 --> 00:17:45,778
<i>The warnings keep popping up.</i>

255
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:49,907
{\an8}<i>The system issues warnings
at critical moments to prevent my death</i>

256
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,242
{\an8}<i>because I am a player?</i>

257
00:17:53,077 --> 00:17:56,955
{\an8}<i>No matter how I look at it,
it can't be an ordinary second awakening.</i>

258
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:01,168
{\an8}I must hold on for at least
three minutes until its skill ends…

259
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,420
{\an8}No, this is too dangerous.

260
00:18:05,506 --> 00:18:06,799
Do I have to resort to this…

261
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:23,482
What can I do to survive?

262
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,902
<i>A few more hits and I'll be dead.</i>

263
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:28,904
<i>Is there any way…</i>

264
00:18:30,864 --> 00:18:31,865
{\an8}<i>The shop…</i>

265
00:18:31,949 --> 00:18:32,950
{\an8}<i>I completely forgot.</i>

266
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:36,787
<i>One bottle costs 300 gold coins…</i>

267
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:38,413
Three bottles.

268
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:46,588
One bottle only restores 100 points of HP?

269
00:18:47,089 --> 00:18:48,340
This is simply…

270
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,635
<i>Poison?</i>

271
00:18:52,344 --> 00:18:54,721
You've had too much to drink.
Alcohol is poison to the body.

272
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,181
I'm fine.

273
00:18:58,433 --> 00:18:59,643
<i>I have to do this.</i>

274
00:19:17,411 --> 00:19:18,370
Okay.

275
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,465
<i>It's not over yet!</i>

276
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:33,260
<i>I can still move!</i>

277
00:19:38,348 --> 00:19:39,808
<i>Its skill effect has ended!</i>

278
00:21:29,418 --> 00:21:30,711
<i>Is this the item I obtained?</i>

279
00:21:31,712 --> 00:21:32,921
Another key?

280
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:36,883
Is this to open the door
that Cerberus was guarding?

281
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:39,094
What is this?

282
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:47,185
"The pattern for the Elixir of Life"?

283
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:54,318
<i>This experience made me understand
my current strength.</i>

284
00:21:54,818 --> 00:21:57,654
<i>Entering the castle at my current level
would surely mean death.</i>

285
00:21:58,363 --> 00:21:59,197
<i>But…</i>

286
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:02,242
I will return in the near future.

287
00:22:03,201 --> 00:22:04,328
Definitely.
