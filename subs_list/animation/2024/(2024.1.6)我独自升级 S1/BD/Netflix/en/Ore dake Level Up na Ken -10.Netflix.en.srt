1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,887
Jinwoo, you've changed a lot.

2
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:10,932
Yet, I remain the same.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,393
So much has happened to me.

4
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:16,771
Everyone benefits differently
from their experiences.

5
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:19,482
That's true.

6
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:24,237
As a hunter, I seem to be too timid.

7
00:00:24,863 --> 00:00:26,948
Although I've tried to overcome it,

8
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:28,575
it's too hard.

9
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:33,580
Logically, I should be taking part
in A-rank or B-rank,

10
00:00:33,663 --> 00:00:36,249
or at least C-rank missions.

11
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,919
Yet, I've always chosen D-rank
or E-rank ones.

12
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:44,215
That's why I got to know you.

13
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,302
Looking back, it seems like
I was always treating you.

14
00:00:48,845 --> 00:00:51,306
<i>Honestly, when you kept
getting injured at the beginning,</i>

15
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:53,016
<i>I found you a bit annoying.</i>

16
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:57,562
<i>But Jinwoo, you have always survived.</i>

17
00:00:57,645 --> 00:01:00,315
<i>Your eyes are brimming with life,</i>

18
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:02,984
{\an8}and I'll never forget them.

19
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:07,072
{\an8}We agreed to have a meal together, right?

20
00:01:07,864 --> 00:01:10,033
Here. Take it back.

21
00:01:11,576 --> 00:01:12,577
Are you…

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,622
Actually, I've decided to retire.

23
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:19,542
I plan to go back to my hometown.

24
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:23,588
If you happen to come nearby,
please let me know.

25
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,089
I'll take you out to enjoy the view.

26
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:30,887
We'll have a meal together then.

27
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:31,888
Okay.

28
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:51,074
I don't think you at E-rank
can defeat Kang Taeshik at B-rank.

29
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,371
I don't want to suspect again
that you had a second awakening.

30
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,499
But I still want to tell you,

31
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:03,002
if you want to live longer,
be more careful.

32
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:04,879
What do you mean?

33
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:08,466
In the annihilation incident
of Hwang Dongsuk's team,

34
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:11,678
the only survivors were you
and a D-rank hunter.

35
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:15,473
Hwang Dongsuk's brother,
Hunter Hwang Dongsoo,

36
00:02:15,557 --> 00:02:18,184
{\an8}may have already set his sights on you.

37
00:02:19,727 --> 00:02:22,814
S-rank Hunter Hwang Dongsoo
has set his sights on me?

38
00:02:22,897 --> 00:02:24,065
Yes.

39
00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:26,317
What happened in the dungeon
isn't important.

40
00:02:27,068 --> 00:02:28,987
The fact is Hwang Dongsuk died

41
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,365
and you came back alive.

42
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,495
<i>He is an S-rank hunter.
The law cannot restrain him.</i>

43
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:42,083
<i>The existence of S-rank hunters is
both a miracle and a disaster.</i>

44
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:45,920
{\an8}The monster that even monsters fear

45
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:48,172
{\an8}will very likely come after you.

46
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:49,173
{\an8}That's it.

47
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:52,427
{\an8}If possible,

48
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,847
{\an8}I think you'd better leave
this country with your family.

49
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,186
<i>I have another reason to become stronger.</i>

50
00:03:03,229 --> 00:03:04,480
<i>I must become stronger.</i>

51
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,442
<i>Only then can I survive.</i>

52
00:04:40,702 --> 00:04:41,953
Um…

53
00:04:42,537 --> 00:04:43,788
Jinho.

54
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:45,331
Why are these people here?

55
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:48,501
Them?

56
00:04:48,584 --> 00:04:50,128
Isn't that obvious?

57
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:51,629
They are members of our team.

58
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:56,676
Those hunters who are unable
to work for some reason

59
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,179
and those living in poverty
are my priority targets.

60
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:02,765
The injured and drunkards.

61
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:04,892
That's more convenient for us.

62
00:05:04,976 --> 00:05:07,937
We need at least eight members
to enter a C-rank gate.

63
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:12,608
Hey, why is there a kid?

64
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:15,611
Awakened minors can also participate.

65
00:05:15,695 --> 00:05:17,572
It's not illegal.

66
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,073
Hey.

67
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:21,868
You're being quite rude.

68
00:05:21,951 --> 00:05:24,120
I am a real hunter.

69
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,124
But you're a high-schooler, right?
Were you ever on a raid mission?

70
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:30,835
Er… I haven't.

71
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:32,211
Are you an E-rank hunter?

72
00:05:33,379 --> 00:05:34,797
So what?

73
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:36,758
Never mind.

74
00:05:36,841 --> 00:05:38,968
You're just waiting outside anyway.

75
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:42,472
Only Jinho and I will enter the dungeon.

76
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:46,976
Um… Is it really just you two going in?

77
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:50,563
We get three million
just by waiting outside?

78
00:05:50,646 --> 00:05:51,647
Yes.

79
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:53,858
Three million for one raid mission.

80
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:56,402
You get money
without having to fight, isn't it nice?

81
00:05:58,112 --> 00:05:59,989
But this must be kept secret.

82
00:06:00,656 --> 00:06:02,450
If I find out you didn't,

83
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:06,204
you'll be charged ten times
the reward as per the contract.

84
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:10,541
<i>The stealth rune stone I got
after defeating Kang Taeshik.</i>

85
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,377
<i>I'll try it now.</i>

86
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,266
<i>Good. Looks like I've learned it.</i>

87
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,102
Sorry to keep you waiting.

88
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:33,731
What's with that kit?

89
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:37,360
This is an enhanced armor set
made in Italy.

90
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:41,197
After all, only the two of us
are going into the dungeon.

91
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,616
I have to make some preparations.

92
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:51,249
Take my advice and get it off.

93
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:52,917
Yes.

94
00:06:57,255 --> 00:06:58,506
Jinwoo.

95
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:00,466
Can you pull me up?

96
00:07:03,094 --> 00:07:04,345
Let's set off then.

97
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:07,265
I'm starting to feel a bit nervous.

98
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:10,184
You haven't taken
that thing off your head.

99
00:07:10,268 --> 00:07:12,228
At least let me wear a helmet.

100
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:15,189
All right.

101
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:16,524
Let's go.

102
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:17,483
Yes.

103
00:07:18,276 --> 00:07:19,944
They're really going in by themselves.

104
00:07:20,027 --> 00:07:21,487
Will they be okay?

105
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:22,864
We've already warned them.

106
00:07:22,947 --> 00:07:25,616
We've already got the money,
so just leave them alone.

107
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:30,830
{\an8}A D-rank hunter and an E-rank hunter
want to tackle a C-rank raid mission?

108
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,332
Two greenhorns.

109
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,376
It's not as easy as they think.

110
00:07:41,883 --> 00:07:44,010
Did Song-Yi skip class?

111
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,098
How long has it been?

112
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:51,017
About an hour.

113
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,061
Even a regular team
would take more than two hours.

114
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:54,979
It won't be that…

115
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:58,983
You managed to escape?

116
00:07:59,066 --> 00:08:00,359
Lucky for you.

117
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:02,695
No. They didn't escape.

118
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:05,907
The gate is closing.

119
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:07,742
No way.

120
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:09,619
Did they defeat the boss?

121
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:11,245
Where's the next gate?

122
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:13,414
It takes an hour to get there.

123
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:15,708
Understood, let's go.

124
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:20,087
Everyone, we are leaving.
We have three places to go today.

125
00:08:21,464 --> 00:08:23,883
You can earn nine million in just one day.

126
00:08:23,966 --> 00:08:24,884
Don't you want to go?

127
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,470
These two…

128
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:29,555
Who are they?

129
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:38,022
Jinwoo, I'm all done.

130
00:08:38,105 --> 00:08:38,981
Understood.

131
00:08:39,607 --> 00:08:41,150
I'll take care of it.

132
00:08:48,157 --> 00:08:49,283
I'm heading out.

133
00:08:49,367 --> 00:08:51,869
You're going to work today too?

134
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:53,996
Yeah, can you lock the door?

135
00:09:23,025 --> 00:09:25,027
<i>He even has such a skill.</i>

136
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:28,072
<i>He seems to have gotten even stronger.</i>

137
00:09:29,073 --> 00:09:30,199
<i>Skill, Stealth.</i>

138
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:34,412
<i>Although the process of obtaining this
was unpleasant, this skill is very useful.</i>

139
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,373
<i>Using Stealth in fights is very efficient.</i>

140
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,588
{\an8}<i>The skill level of Dash has increased?</i>

141
00:09:50,052 --> 00:09:51,637
<i>New skills.</i>

142
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,681
<i>Advanced Dagger Wielding and Fatal Strike.</i>

143
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:57,143
{\an8}<i>Great skills too.</i>

144
00:09:59,895 --> 00:10:01,480
You've worked hard, Jinwoo.

145
00:10:01,564 --> 00:10:03,649
I'm almost done collecting.

146
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,318
You take a rest first.

147
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,153
Thanks.

148
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:10,323
{\an8}<i>I have more interesting skills now.</i>

149
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,950
{\an8}<i>But no matter which skill,</i>

150
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:15,703
{\an8}<i>it's limited by its duration,
which means I don't have enough mana.</i>

151
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:18,831
<i>It seems I also need
to increase my intelligence.</i>

152
00:10:19,957 --> 00:10:20,791
<i>All right.</i>

153
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,753
<i>It's going well, but should I head
straight to the Demon's Castle?</i>

154
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:26,797
{\an8}<i>No.</i>

155
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:31,344
{\an8}<i>My current strength should be
above B-rank and below A-rank.</i>

156
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:34,347
<i>Am I capable of challenging that dungeon?</i>

157
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:41,729
"The player has reached
the required level."

158
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:46,025
{\an8}"A job-change quest"?

159
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:49,487
Please take a look at this,

160
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,446
Chief Ahn.

161
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:53,074
What's up, Kichul?

162
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:56,702
This is the bidding document
for a C-rank gate.

163
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,537
One hundred fifty million?!

164
00:10:59,038 --> 00:11:03,668
Someone spent 150 million
to conquer a C-rank gate?

165
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,044
Yes.

166
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:07,546
There has been a raid team

167
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:10,674
that bid double the market price
for every C-rank gate lately.

168
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:14,637
Their Captain is… "Yoo Jinho"?

169
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,305
I've never heard of this person.

170
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:19,725
He is the second son
of Yoojin Construction's chairman.

171
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,060
Yoojin Construction?

172
00:11:21,644 --> 00:11:23,646
He might cause his company to lose money.

173
00:11:24,271 --> 00:11:26,941
Even if it's a rich kid having fun,
he's gone too far.

174
00:11:29,276 --> 00:11:31,404
{\an8}"Sung Jinwoo, E-rank"?

175
00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:32,488
Yes.

176
00:11:32,571 --> 00:11:34,949
Their members are also
put together temporarily.

177
00:11:35,032 --> 00:11:36,617
I have no idea what they're trying to do.

178
00:11:38,953 --> 00:11:40,079
{\an8}<i>No.</i>

179
00:11:40,162 --> 00:11:44,500
{\an8}<i>The name Sung Jinwoo also appeared
in the double dungeon incident.</i>

180
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:46,127
{\an8}<i>There's something fishy.</i>

181
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,586
{\an8}<i>There definitely is.</i>

182
00:11:49,547 --> 00:11:51,298
-Hey, wait.
-I won.

183
00:11:51,382 --> 00:11:53,342
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

184
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:55,636
No, it's okay.

185
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:57,847
You came back earlier than expected.

186
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,225
Collecting mana crystals
took longer than I thought.

187
00:12:01,767 --> 00:12:02,935
All right, let's go.

188
00:12:03,561 --> 00:12:04,979
You must be tired too.

189
00:12:05,062 --> 00:12:06,439
Do you want me to drive?

190
00:12:07,398 --> 00:12:10,693
I'm getting restless from boredom.
At least let me do something.

191
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:11,902
I see.

192
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:13,028
What?

193
00:12:13,112 --> 00:12:15,531
-Nothing.
-We agreed for you to wait outside.

194
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:17,199
You don't need to do anything more.

195
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:20,661
What? Hunter Sung Jinwoo
is a second awakener?

196
00:12:20,744 --> 00:12:22,496
Yes, that's right.

197
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,831
Do you have any proof?

198
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:29,211
Hunter Sung has had three major incidents,
yet he came out alive every time.

199
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:31,547
<i>The first was the double dungeon incident.</i>

200
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:35,968
<i>The second was the annihilation incident
of the Hwang Dongsuk's team.</i>

201
00:12:36,051 --> 00:12:38,429
<i>The third was the incident
of prisoners being killed</i>

202
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:40,306
<i>by the Surveillance Team hunter.</i>

203
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:44,310
Nearly all participants
in these events died.

204
00:12:44,393 --> 00:12:45,644
Yet he survived.

205
00:12:46,187 --> 00:12:49,148
If he's not a second awakener,
there's no way to explain this.

206
00:12:49,231 --> 00:12:51,567
That… is true.

207
00:12:53,277 --> 00:12:55,988
By the way, Chief Ahn, where are we going?

208
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,032
Where else?

209
00:13:00,034 --> 00:13:02,328
To scout for new talent.

210
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,458
What's this?

211
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:10,085
It's like they're having a picnic.

212
00:13:11,712 --> 00:13:12,546
Mister,

213
00:13:13,214 --> 00:13:16,342
this area is currently off-limits.

214
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:18,344
Ah, sorry about that.

215
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:22,139
I was just curious because it looked like
hunters were gathering here.

216
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:23,807
That's a gate, right?

217
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:25,809
Are you sure it's okay to stand so close?

218
00:13:26,393 --> 00:13:28,354
Please don't treat me like a child.

219
00:13:28,437 --> 00:13:29,772
I am a hunter too.

220
00:13:29,855 --> 00:13:31,941
Eh? Then…

221
00:13:32,024 --> 00:13:33,984
Are you also with this team?

222
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:36,445
Yes.

223
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:38,822
But…

224
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,034
<i>Hunter Sung…</i>

225
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:45,204
<i>He went in without the rest of the team.</i>

226
00:13:45,287 --> 00:13:47,665
<i>If I'm not mistaken,
he must be a rare strong one.</i>

227
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:49,542
<i>No, a super strong one.</i>

228
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,335
I see.

229
00:13:51,418 --> 00:13:53,128
I apologize for disturbing you.

230
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:54,922
Please be careful.

231
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:56,924
Eh? Are we leaving, Chief?

232
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:00,761
The captain is coming out.

233
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,596
Everyone, prepare to leave.

234
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:08,018
Do you have any tasks
scheduled for tomorrow?

235
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:09,728
I'm busy tomorrow.

236
00:14:09,812 --> 00:14:11,105
Should we take a day off?

237
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:12,982
Ah… tomorrow?

238
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:16,068
I do have a gate reserved.

239
00:14:16,151 --> 00:14:17,695
Should I cancel it?

240
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:19,822
Don't cancel if you've reserved it.

241
00:14:19,905 --> 00:14:21,198
That'd be a waste of money.

242
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:23,909
I can keep it for two days.

243
00:14:25,744 --> 00:14:28,122
{\an8}Then keep it for now.

244
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:29,665
I understand.

245
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:31,834
Thank you for waiting.

246
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,419
All right, let's head to the next one.

247
00:15:07,369 --> 00:15:10,623
That dream again?

248
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:21,300
The day is approaching.

249
00:15:25,095 --> 00:15:26,597
Well, thank you, everyone.

250
00:15:32,561 --> 00:15:35,773
Excuse me for intruding, Hunter Sung.

251
00:15:36,607 --> 00:15:37,608
Nice to meet you.

252
00:15:37,691 --> 00:15:41,654
I'm Ahn Sangmin from White Tiger Guild's
second management division.

253
00:15:41,737 --> 00:15:44,365
May we have a chat with you?

254
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:48,827
I believe I don't need
to elaborate further.

255
00:15:48,911 --> 00:15:54,124
Our White Tiger Guild
is one of the best in the country.

256
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,252
So we are always looking
for outstanding talents.

257
00:15:58,128 --> 00:16:01,090
Let me get straight to the point.

258
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:04,426
We can offer you twice as much money
as Yoojin Construction can offer,

259
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,512
if you join our White Tiger Guild.

260
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:11,600
If you have any conditions,
I will do my best to satisfy them.

261
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,102
<i>How's that?</i>

262
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:15,688
<i>For someone who was
an E-rank hunter not long ago,</i>

263
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:17,147
<i>this must be a chance you can't refuse.</i>

264
00:16:17,731 --> 00:16:19,775
<i>I will make you say yes.</i>

265
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:24,238
How much is the market value
of White Tiger Guild's building?

266
00:16:24,822 --> 00:16:25,739
What?

267
00:16:25,823 --> 00:16:29,952
Well… it's probably worth
around 50 billion.

268
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:33,414
{\an8}So, do you plan to give me
the entire building?

269
00:16:34,623 --> 00:16:36,208
I don't quite understand.

270
00:16:40,254 --> 00:16:42,256
Thirty billion?!

271
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:45,217
Did you hear that?

272
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:49,096
The terms offered to me
by Yoojin Construction is a building

273
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,848
with a market value of 30 billion.

274
00:16:51,432 --> 00:16:53,225
You said you would pay me double.

275
00:16:53,308 --> 00:16:56,145
I thought you were going to give me
that 50-billion building.

276
00:16:56,687 --> 00:16:59,356
If you don't believe me,
I can prove it here.

277
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,651
But…

278
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:06,155
Such a large amount
is beyond my authority.

279
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:08,032
I need to discuss it with my superiors.

280
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,409
Then this is the end of the topic.

281
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:14,496
{\an8}<i>Was I too hasty?</i>

282
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,333
{\an8}<i>I should have investigated the terms
offered by Yoojin Construction first.</i>

283
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,127
Right, by the way,

284
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,755
how did you know about me?

285
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:24,923
Have you been

286
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,009
secretly investigating me?

287
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:29,803
Huh? Where is he?

288
00:17:36,518 --> 00:17:39,563
<i>Th-This is…</i><i>a Stealth skill.</i>

289
00:17:40,147 --> 00:17:42,858
<i>So he is a second awakener
with a Stealth skill.</i>

290
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:47,112
<i>No wonder Yoojin Construction
offered him such a large sum.</i>

291
00:17:47,738 --> 00:17:51,033
I-I apologize for investigating you
without permission.

292
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:53,702
But I meant no malice.

293
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:54,912
Don't look back.

294
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,248
{\an8}Because someone is
monopolizing the dungeons,

295
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:00,501
{\an8}it prevents us from training
our newcomers.

296
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:03,420
{\an8}According to company regulations,
they can't be deployed without training.

297
00:18:03,504 --> 00:18:06,381
To negotiate the deal regarding gates,

298
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:11,512
we found you when we investigated
the person who was buying up dungeons.

299
00:18:12,012 --> 00:18:15,849
Besides you, how many others
know about me?

300
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:21,063
Just me and one of my subordinates.

301
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:24,358
I don't want anyone to know about me.

302
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:26,860
If rumors about me spread,

303
00:18:26,944 --> 00:18:29,571
you will be the first person I suspect.

304
00:18:30,572 --> 00:18:34,535
I have an obligation
to report to the guild.

305
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:36,870
But I don't want to die.

306
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:39,665
I will also keep my subordinate silent.

307
00:18:39,748 --> 00:18:41,083
Thank you.

308
00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:45,712
It seems our monopoly of C-rank gates
has caused you some trouble.

309
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,800
I apologize, but this situation
will continue for a while.

310
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,927
That's going to be difficult.

311
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:55,222
In that case, we will be unable
to train newcomers.

312
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:57,349
Then, would you like
to make a deal with me?

313
00:18:58,183 --> 00:18:59,935
A deal?

314
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:03,897
I can sell you three C-rank gates
we have reserved.

315
00:19:04,606 --> 00:19:08,652
If you don't take it, you can't get access
to a C-rank dungeon for a while.

316
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:11,405
{\an8}<i>He is using hunger marketing
to lure me in.</i>

317
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:12,489
{\an8}<i>But…</i>

318
00:19:12,573 --> 00:19:13,824
{\an8}I understand.

319
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:15,117
{\an8}How much are they?

320
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:17,494
Three hundred million for each.

321
00:19:17,578 --> 00:19:19,204
Th-Three hundred million?!

322
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:25,335
The mana crystals and magic gems
in a C-rank dungeon

323
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:27,171
are worth at most 200 million.

324
00:19:27,254 --> 00:19:29,756
I hope the price can be lowered
to 200 million--

325
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,757
Okay.

326
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:34,553
Deal.

327
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:37,014
Then…

328
00:19:37,097 --> 00:19:39,308
You will give us three gates, right?

329
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,560
Yes, three C-rank gates.

330
00:19:41,643 --> 00:19:43,020
Six hundred million in total.

331
00:19:44,605 --> 00:19:46,190
Then it's settled.

332
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:49,943
Please transfer the money
into this account today.

333
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:53,322
And another thing, I have a gift for you.

334
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:55,324
Can you close your eyes
and open your mouth?

335
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:58,702
Don't worry. I won't hurt you.

336
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:10,422
<i>Really? My wound has healed!</i>

337
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:11,798
Goodbye.

338
00:20:14,927 --> 00:20:17,429
Since you have shown me these abilities,

339
00:20:17,512 --> 00:20:20,891
can I take it that
I have earned your trust?

340
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,978
On the condition that you keep my secret.

341
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:29,775
Chief.

342
00:20:30,651 --> 00:20:32,819
How did it go?

343
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:34,571
Hey, Kichul.

344
00:20:35,072 --> 00:20:38,992
{\an8}He might be stronger than we imagine.

345
00:20:43,997 --> 00:20:46,625
<i>Jinwoo, I've received the money.</i>

346
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:48,919
<i>Six hundred million
has been transferred to me.</i>

347
00:20:49,503 --> 00:20:53,590
<i>How did you sell the gates we
planned to cancel for such a high price?</i>

348
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:55,634
<i>Who did you sell them to?</i>

349
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,552
That's a trade secret.

350
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,847
What?

351
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:03,558
There are still C-rank gates left
in our area?

352
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:07,813
Yes, Yoojin Construction only bid
on those three gates.

353
00:21:07,896 --> 00:21:11,024
Current bidding prices
are all below 70 million.

354
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:12,526
We've been tricked.

355
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:16,780
<i>Not only did I fail to poach him,</i>

356
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:18,699
<i>I even got tricked.</i>

357
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:20,242
<i>What a disgrace.</i>

358
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:23,704
{\an8}<i>Is this how the strong are?</i>

359
00:21:25,247 --> 00:21:26,415
A message.

360
00:21:26,498 --> 00:21:27,666
Who sent it?

361
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,918
<i>This is Sung Jinwoo.</i>

362
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:33,213
<i>With this, we're even.
I'll forget the fact that you spied on me.</i>

363
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,759
I see. He tricked me.

364
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,804
I admit defeat this time.

365
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:43,181
He is not to be underestimated.

366
00:21:43,265 --> 00:21:45,517
Was it from Hunter Sung?

367
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,435
Yes.

368
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:49,021
Although he tricked me this time,

369
00:21:49,604 --> 00:21:52,524
I managed to get his phone number.

370
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:56,403
I'll compromise this time.

371
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:01,950
A job-change quest…

372
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:03,952
How exciting.
