1
00:00:02,716 --> 00:00:04,134
What on earth is that thing…

2
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:07,595
Let's run!

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,555
Wait!

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:09,681
We might get killed.

5
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:10,807
What do you suggest we do then?

6
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:12,183
Is there no other way out?

7
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:13,601
How would I know?

8
00:00:13,685 --> 00:00:14,853
Two people are already dead.

9
00:00:14,936 --> 00:00:16,229
Everyone, don't move!

10
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:18,398
If we move rashly,
the statue will attack again!

11
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:25,363
Joohee…

12
00:00:25,905 --> 00:00:27,073
That was close.

13
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:30,493
If you didn't notice
the statue's movement,

14
00:00:30,577 --> 00:00:32,037
we'd all be dead by now.

15
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,204
What?

16
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:35,623
You told us to get down
because you knew it, right?

17
00:00:35,707 --> 00:00:36,666
No.

18
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,668
I just sensed an imminent threat…

19
00:00:40,378 --> 00:00:41,296
Mr. Song!

20
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:42,255
Your arm…

21
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:45,175
I can still bear it.

22
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:46,843
Can you help me stop the bleeding?

23
00:00:49,888 --> 00:00:52,599
I should have asked Joohee to treat me.

24
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:54,517
But she's too weak-minded.

25
00:00:55,435 --> 00:00:57,437
That's why despite being a B-rank healer,

26
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,522
she can only participate
in simple missions.

27
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:03,985
I've also participated
in a couple of B-rank missions.

28
00:01:04,694 --> 00:01:06,821
But that thing might be an A-rank one,

29
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:09,032
or even an S-rank one.

30
00:01:10,617 --> 00:01:13,912
The Commandments of the Cartenon Temple
written on the stone are…

31
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:16,456
"First, worship the God."

32
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:18,625
"Second, praise the God."

33
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,877
"Third, believe the God."

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,880
"Those who do not obey will not
be able to leave this place alive."

35
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:25,590
Mr. Song.

36
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:27,091
The god mentioned

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,302
should be that, right?

38
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:33,097
<i>More than a decade ago,</i>

39
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,351
<i>gates that could connect
to a different dimension</i>

40
00:01:36,434 --> 00:01:38,394
<i>suddenly appeared in the world.</i>

41
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,065
<i>Abnormal phenomena kept occurring
around the world.</i>

42
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:48,947
<i>For example, the Awakened
are known as hunters.</i>

43
00:01:49,572 --> 00:01:55,203
<i>Hunters are responsible for killing magic
beasts in dungeons within the gates.</i>

44
00:01:55,703 --> 00:01:59,124
<i>And after hunters awaken,
their abilities will not change.</i>

45
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:03,711
<i>However, sometimes,
on the other side of the gate,</i>

46
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:10,844
<i>there are terrifying monsters
that bring despair.</i>

47
00:03:43,394 --> 00:03:45,146
-Did you see that?
-That film?

48
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:48,024
What were you doing?

49
00:03:48,107 --> 00:03:49,901
Class is about to start.

50
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:50,818
Something came up.

51
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:56,032
Jinah, your brother is a hunter, right?

52
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:57,575
Right.

53
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,203
But he's just an E-rank hunter.

54
00:04:00,286 --> 00:04:02,956
He always ends up being covered in wounds.

55
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,333
Last time he was covered in bandages.

56
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:08,670
But why do you ask me this?

57
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:09,754
No reason.

58
00:04:10,922 --> 00:04:13,216
If it were me,
I wouldn't have ended up like that.

59
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:16,427
We don't stand a chance.

60
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,138
Let's get out
once the situation settles down.

61
00:04:19,222 --> 00:04:21,140
-It might not be that easy--
-I can't die here!

62
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:25,186
I finally managed to sign a contract
with a large association.

63
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,814
I can't die in this kind of place.

64
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:29,774
What are you doing? Don't move!

65
00:04:29,857 --> 00:04:31,109
I can do it.

66
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:32,860
I'm very confident in my speed.

67
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,237
I'll finish it before it attacks.

68
00:04:45,957 --> 00:04:46,958
Damn it!

69
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:52,755
It can finish us off at any time.

70
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,551
As easy as crushing an ant.

71
00:04:57,135 --> 00:05:00,555
So why isn't it doing it now?

72
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:04,225
{\an8}<i>It has the ability to kill us,
but it isn't making a move.</i>

73
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:08,313
<i>It's different from those magic beasts
that attack blindly.</i>

74
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:12,025
Mr. Song.

75
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:13,901
What is the first commandment?

76
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:15,028
Commandment?

77
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:16,529
The first one is…

78
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:18,031
"Worship the God."

79
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:20,366
<i>God.</i>

80
00:05:22,285 --> 00:05:24,120
This dungeon has its own rules.

81
00:05:24,203 --> 00:05:25,705
W-What are you doing?

82
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:27,665
If I'm not wrong…

83
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:29,584
Hey, stop it…

84
00:05:33,004 --> 00:05:36,716
You don't look like you're seeking death.

85
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:54,358
Everyone!

86
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:56,152
Kneel to the statue!

87
00:05:56,235 --> 00:05:58,071
Huh? Kneel to it?

88
00:05:58,154 --> 00:05:59,614
What nonsense are you talking about?

89
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:01,532
Did you figure out something?

90
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:02,450
Yes.

91
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:06,746
As long as our heads are below
a certain height, it won't attack.

92
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:09,415
This is probably the meaning
of the first commandment.

93
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,005
Are you sure?

94
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:17,757
Yes, sort of…

95
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,218
If so…

96
00:06:26,015 --> 00:06:27,809
<i>Can we really survive</i>

97
00:06:27,892 --> 00:06:29,143
<i>by just doing this?</i>

98
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:38,027
<i>Its expression is terrifying.</i>

99
00:06:38,111 --> 00:06:39,987
<i>Its expression changed.</i>

100
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:44,826
It's not attacking us.

101
00:06:45,993 --> 00:06:47,578
Hey, if you move around…

102
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:52,250
Look,

103
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,835
it stopped attacking.

104
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,755
Is it over just like that?

105
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,048
Are we saved?

106
00:06:59,132 --> 00:06:59,966
We made it.

107
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,176
-We're saved.
-I can go back alive.

108
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:04,971
<i>No… It's not over yet.</i>

109
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:14,647
It's not over?

110
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,566
Sung, what's next?

111
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:18,276
Can you think of something?

112
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:20,361
I… I don't know.

113
00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:25,283
I think we can't violate
the commandments here.

114
00:07:25,867 --> 00:07:27,493
The second commandment
is "Praise the God."

115
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:28,744
This is the clue.

116
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:29,704
Praise?

117
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:31,330
How?

118
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,124
Leave it to me.

119
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,544
I am conducting research
on traditional folklore.

120
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:39,422
I know how to praise God.

121
00:07:42,216 --> 00:07:43,885
Lord.

122
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:45,970
The ruler who brings order to the world.

123
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:47,889
Any reaction?

124
00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:50,057
It seems to have slowed down…

125
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:53,186
Guide me to the path of truth.

126
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:54,979
<i>Wait. This is…</i>

127
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:58,941
I wish to follow the will of God.

128
00:07:59,942 --> 00:08:02,278
<i>These are not the words
to praise this god.</i>

129
00:08:02,904 --> 00:08:05,448
We will worship and honor you.

130
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:07,074
Lord.

131
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:09,285
The ruler who brings order to the world.

132
00:08:14,874 --> 00:08:16,584
-Damn it!
-Run!

133
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:26,385
It's dangerous to be together.

134
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:27,386
Scatter!

135
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,387
All right.

136
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:30,848
Joohee, run!

137
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:34,769
<i>How can I die in a place like this?</i>

138
00:08:35,353 --> 00:08:37,396
<i>My family is still waiting for me!</i>

139
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:40,900
I should be safe here, right?

140
00:08:41,609 --> 00:08:43,027
Hey, Park, behind you!

141
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:55,331
Park!

142
00:08:56,374 --> 00:08:59,001
<i>"Praise the God…"</i>

143
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:02,672
<i>What should we praise about it?</i>

144
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:03,965
<i>It's essentially a demon.</i>

145
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,175
<i>But…</i>

146
00:09:06,842 --> 00:09:09,011
<i>I can't just abandon her.</i>

147
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,723
<i>Is there any clue…</i>

148
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:14,308
<i>Spear.</i>

149
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:15,810
<i>Axe.</i>

150
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:18,646
My… my hand!

151
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:20,481
<i>Hammer.</i>

152
00:09:20,565 --> 00:09:21,691
<i>Sword.</i>

153
00:09:21,774 --> 00:09:22,650
<i>Musical instrument.</i>

154
00:09:23,568 --> 00:09:24,402
Musical instrument…

155
00:09:27,363 --> 00:09:31,075
Everyone, get under the statue
holding a musical instrument!

156
00:09:31,158 --> 00:09:32,034
Musical instrument?

157
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,959
It's playing?

158
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:43,754
The statue holding a musical instrument
won't attack us!

159
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:53,514
Damn it.

160
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:57,435
Start playing quickly! Come on!

161
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:00,980
<i>Two people can't stand here together?</i>

162
00:10:01,063 --> 00:10:02,565
Joohee, stay here!

163
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:04,317
Jinwoo!

164
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:14,910
<i>Over there.</i>

165
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:25,421
Not there!

166
00:10:29,634 --> 00:10:30,760
No!

167
00:10:30,843 --> 00:10:32,803
Jinwoo!

168
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:46,025
It's not over yet.

169
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:50,946
Not yet!

170
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,512
Is this the answer to "Praise the God"?

171
00:11:21,143 --> 00:11:22,061
Jinwoo!

172
00:11:22,645 --> 00:11:23,687
Are you okay?

173
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:26,273
Yes. I'm fine.

174
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:33,406
Jinwoo.

175
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:34,323
What is the matter?

176
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:40,287
Your foot…

177
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,793
It's enough, Joohee.

178
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:47,878
I'm okay now.

179
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:49,004
What are you talking about?

180
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:51,215
I'll definitely cure you.

181
00:11:54,927 --> 00:11:56,053
Joohee.

182
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:58,848
So tragic…

183
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:00,683
Indeed.

184
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:04,311
I'm very sorry that you lost your arm.

185
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:07,773
As the captain, you made a hasty decision.

186
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:09,150
This is karma.

187
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,067
How cruel.

188
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:11,068
It's because Mr. Kim--

189
00:12:11,152 --> 00:12:12,570
We took a vote.

190
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:14,655
You voted in favor, didn't you?

191
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:19,034
Indeed, it was me
who made the final decision.

192
00:12:19,702 --> 00:12:21,620
I must bear all the responsibility.

193
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,665
<i>Now is not the time to argue.</i>

194
00:12:24,748 --> 00:12:26,500
<i>There's still one commandment…</i>

195
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:30,087
What's happening this time?

196
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:31,338
An earthquake?

197
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,468
What is that?

198
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:37,219
An altar…

199
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:41,599
Doesn't it often appear in mythology?

200
00:12:41,682 --> 00:12:43,934
It's for offering tributes
or living sacrifices to the god.

201
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:47,188
The third commandment
is "Believe the God."

202
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:52,610
I might be ignorant,
but I know what this means.

203
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,737
Sung.

204
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,948
We need to offer a sacrifice, right?

205
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,039
My companion, who bragged about his wife
before departure, was cut in half.

206
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:06,749
There were others too.

207
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,668
Do you remember what you just said?

208
00:13:09,752 --> 00:13:11,962
Now it's your turn
to take responsibility, Captain.

209
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:14,548
-How can you, Mr. Kim--
-Sung, shut up!

210
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:17,092
I understand.

211
00:13:17,968 --> 00:13:19,887
Let me go alone.

212
00:13:21,847 --> 00:13:24,099
<i>It's not just his fault.</i>

213
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,393
<i>We all voted to come in here.</i>

214
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,191
What's happening now?

215
00:13:35,736 --> 00:13:36,570
Sung.

216
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:39,031
Is there something else I need to do?

217
00:13:39,615 --> 00:13:41,033
<i>What does this mean?</i>

218
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,577
<i>Doesn't it want a living sacrifice?</i>

219
00:13:44,912 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:46,664 --> 00:13:50,000
I'd like to check the altar.
Can you help me over there?

221
00:13:52,503 --> 00:13:54,672
Please take me near the altar.

222
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:56,549
But in this case…

223
00:13:56,632 --> 00:13:58,133
I don't think anything will happen.

224
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:07,560
Have you figured out anything?

225
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:08,894
No, not yet…

226
00:14:09,687 --> 00:14:12,731
If we wait here,
will someone come to rescue us?

227
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:15,651
Today is the seventh day
after the dungeon was created.

228
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:19,154
I think they will take action
before we are rescued.

229
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,286
<i>The gate will be fully open
after seven days.</i>

230
00:14:27,621 --> 00:14:29,456
<i>And that is Dungeon Break.</i>

231
00:14:30,499 --> 00:14:33,878
<i>Then, the magic beasts will pass through
the gate to the human world.</i>

232
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:39,425
<i>That's why we must defeat the Boss and
close the gate within the time limit.</i>

233
00:14:39,508 --> 00:14:41,385
<i>This is another purpose
of the raid mission.</i>

234
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:45,347
<i>If we fail here,</i>

235
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,976
<i>it will run out into the world.</i>

236
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:50,686
Hello.

237
00:14:50,769 --> 00:14:52,563
Miss Sung.

238
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:54,106
You come every day.

239
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:03,198
Mother, it's me again.

240
00:15:03,282 --> 00:15:05,910
Let me tell you, Song-Yi was late today.

241
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:07,870
She said something kept her,

242
00:15:07,953 --> 00:15:09,705
but she definitely overslept.

243
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:14,293
And the last nationwide exam…

244
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,215
Please come over here, you two.

245
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:24,136
This way, we should be able to light
the corresponding number of flames.

246
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:26,805
Only then will we know what will happen.

247
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:43,948
The door is open.

248
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:45,658
Can we go out now?

249
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:47,034
Could this be a trap…

250
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:53,582
What's that sound?

251
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,834
The… the statues are coming this way.

252
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:57,419
What should we do?

253
00:15:57,503 --> 00:15:59,713
Why are they walking towards us?

254
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:06,095
No!

255
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:08,180
Joohee, don't close your eyes.

256
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:09,848
Once we look away, they'll move closer.

257
00:16:10,724 --> 00:16:13,018
It's like the game
we used to play as kids.

258
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:15,354
Everyone must keep their eyes
fixed on the statues.

259
00:16:28,575 --> 00:16:29,493
No!

260
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:30,869
-Hey!
-Wait!

261
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:37,084
Sung, what is this?

262
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,962
The door closed a bit,
but she made it out.

263
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:41,422
<i>What's going on…</i>

264
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,925
<i>The blue flames will go out over time.</i>

265
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:48,137
<i>And once someone leaves the altar,
the orange flames will also go out.</i>

266
00:16:48,887 --> 00:16:50,806
<i>The first commandment is "worship."</i>

267
00:16:51,557 --> 00:16:53,017
<i>The second is "praise."</i>

268
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,019
<i>The third is "believe."</i>

269
00:16:56,812 --> 00:16:58,564
<i>That door must be a trap.</i>

270
00:16:58,647 --> 00:17:01,692
<i>It offers false optimism
to us who are in terror.</i>

271
00:17:01,775 --> 00:17:05,112
<i>Perhaps it tests
our faith in God in this way.</i>

272
00:17:05,195 --> 00:17:06,780
I-I'm sorry.

273
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:08,323
I can't hold on any longer.

274
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:11,744
-Jungho!
-Hey!

275
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:14,830
No!

276
00:17:20,085 --> 00:17:21,295
Everyone, don't move!

277
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:23,756
If anyone else leaves,
it will create a blind spot!

278
00:17:24,631 --> 00:17:26,300
Sung, what does this mean?

279
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:27,509
Explain it!

280
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:31,263
Just keep it this way, and don't move
your gaze away from the statue.

281
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,599
The blue flame is a timer.

282
00:17:33,682 --> 00:17:36,226
When it goes out completely,
everyone should be able to escape.

283
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:39,104
But, Sung…

284
00:17:39,188 --> 00:17:43,358
It's also possible that when the flame
goes out completely, we'll be locked up.

285
00:17:44,943 --> 00:17:46,195
To be honest,

286
00:17:46,278 --> 00:17:49,948
I never thought that you would be
so capable as the weakest one.

287
00:17:50,032 --> 00:17:52,659
We can survive until now

288
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:54,203
all thanks to you.

289
00:17:54,703 --> 00:17:55,954
Mr. Kim…

290
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:58,332
But you see,

291
00:17:58,415 --> 00:18:00,417
I have a family waiting for me.

292
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:02,711
{\an8}I don't want to die yet.

293
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:05,089
{\an8}I want to go home alive.

294
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:07,174
I can't hold on any longer.

295
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:09,009
I'm sorry.

296
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:15,808
<i>Why…</i>

297
00:18:17,768 --> 00:18:18,936
<i>I won't give up.</i>

298
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:20,437
<i>I must survive.</i>

299
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:24,233
<i>I have always survived this way.</i>

300
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:29,905
You two, leave quickly.

301
00:18:30,697 --> 00:18:32,407
Mr. Song…

302
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:36,995
I think as long as one person stays,
that door won't close.

303
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:40,082
Then I should let the young people
with promising futures leave first.

304
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:42,793
Joohee, take Sung with you.

305
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:44,002
Okay!

306
00:18:46,421 --> 00:18:49,216
Strange…

307
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:50,801
My leg…

308
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:52,427
I can't move it.

309
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:56,223
You've overexerted yourself
when treating Sung.

310
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:58,183
Mr. Song.

311
00:18:58,267 --> 00:18:59,393
Take Joohee and leave.

312
00:19:00,227 --> 00:19:01,979
What? I said I would stay--

313
00:19:02,062 --> 00:19:04,189
Then who will help Joohee out?!

314
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,191
There's no time, hurry up!

315
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:09,027
No… Jinwoo…

316
00:19:09,111 --> 00:19:10,070
Let me stay!

317
00:19:10,154 --> 00:19:12,865
I promised I would take you out
to eat, right?

318
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:15,325
Use this to buy something to eat.

319
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:17,161
After I get out,

320
00:19:17,244 --> 00:19:18,871
I'll come to you
for the rest of the money.

321
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:20,664
How can you still joke--

322
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,042
{\an8}I'm sorry.

323
00:19:24,126 --> 00:19:26,670
{\an8}We're really running out of time.

324
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:28,755
{\an8}-I'll leave her in your care.
-All right.

325
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:36,889
<i>Great.</i>

326
00:19:36,972 --> 00:19:38,640
<i>Luckily, I'm the only one
who's going to die.</i>

327
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:41,935
<i>If I had known,</i>

328
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:44,730
<i>I would have bought more insurance.</i>

329
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:53,322
At least one of you will have
to accompany me on the way.

330
00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:55,741
Come at me!

331
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:09,755
<i>I'm always the weakest.</i>

332
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,633
<i>People around me
always keep ridiculing me.</i>

333
00:20:13,175 --> 00:20:15,344
<i>But I've tried my best to make it through.</i>

334
00:20:19,723 --> 00:20:20,766
<i>And yet…</i>

335
00:20:22,351 --> 00:20:23,227
<i>Are you kidding me…</i>

336
00:20:24,102 --> 00:20:26,021
<i>Are you kidding me?!</i>

337
00:20:28,315 --> 00:20:30,859
<i>I wanted to become stronger too.</i>

338
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:33,820
<i>But I couldn't.</i>

339
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:40,410
<i>Despite that,</i>

340
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:43,247
<i>I've survived up to now in my own way.</i>

341
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:49,253
Are you--

342
00:20:49,836 --> 00:20:51,797
<i>You can't hold on anymore?</i>

343
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,049
{\an8}<i>We're all suffering!</i>

344
00:20:54,132 --> 00:20:56,635
{\an8}<i>You're just justifying yourself!</i>

345
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:02,224
<i>All the gratitude is just lip service.</i>

346
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:06,603
<i>It's always the selfish ones
who get all the benefits!</i>

347
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:09,064
<i>I have a family too.</i>

348
00:21:09,147 --> 00:21:11,108
<i>I want to return home alive too!</i>

349
00:21:18,657 --> 00:21:21,034
<i>"Luckily, I'm the only one
who's going to die"?</i>

350
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,627
<i>Stop it, hypocrite.</i>

351
00:21:34,214 --> 00:21:35,090
<i>Don't…</i>

352
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,801
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

353
00:21:44,224 --> 00:21:45,142
<i>If…</i>

354
00:21:46,351 --> 00:21:48,103
<i>If I could have another chance…</i>
