1
00:00:07,387 --> 00:00:09,723
Coming here to die? What idiots.

2
00:00:10,223 --> 00:00:11,766
Fighting with you is boring.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,309
Come together.

4
00:00:15,603 --> 00:00:17,772
I don't even know
which is the magic beast.

5
00:00:20,442 --> 00:00:22,610
Song is as strong as a monster too.

6
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:30,535
It's about done here.

7
00:00:31,077 --> 00:00:33,204
Sung, you've really gotten stronger.

8
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:35,874
Where did you get that great dagger?

9
00:00:37,709 --> 00:00:41,963
Jinwoo, I haven't had
a chance to heal you today.

10
00:00:42,046 --> 00:00:43,673
Ah… Is that so?

11
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:46,468
I hope you won't need it this time.

12
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:48,511
No, I'm counting on you.

13
00:00:49,012 --> 00:00:50,263
<i>Just as I thought.</i>

14
00:00:50,346 --> 00:00:51,639
<i>He has changed a lot.</i>

15
00:00:52,348 --> 00:00:54,225
<i>Not just his appearance,
but even his aura.</i>

16
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:56,644
<i>I can feel his ease and confidence.</i>

17
00:00:57,145 --> 00:00:59,439
Did you learn martial arts?

18
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:01,900
Let's keep going.

19
00:02:34,993 --> 00:02:36,161
{\an8}It's a fork in the road.

20
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:38,955
This one is even easier than expected.

21
00:02:39,038 --> 00:02:40,790
Should we split up into three groups?

22
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:43,376
Although it will increase the risk,

23
00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:45,461
we could end the mission sooner.

24
00:02:45,545 --> 00:02:46,880
Let's do that.

25
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,382
I'll take the right path
with those convicts.

26
00:02:49,883 --> 00:02:51,676
If you find the boss room,

27
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,303
please inform me immediately.

28
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:56,180
<i>It must be because
my perception has improved.</i>

29
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:57,557
<i>From here, I can tell…</i>

30
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,351
<i>The boss is ahead on this path.</i>

31
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:03,646
<i>I can't earn many points
from fighting goblins.</i>

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,648
Mr. Song.

33
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:07,483
Let's take the left path.

34
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:08,443
I got it.

35
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:10,528
Then we'll take the middle one.

36
00:03:10,612 --> 00:03:11,529
Yes.

37
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,751
I can handle goblins of this level.

38
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:27,879
I hope the mission will end well.

39
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,505
It should.

40
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:34,093
They brought the weakest hunter,
so the level of this dungeon must be low.

41
00:03:34,177 --> 00:03:38,181
We thought so too last time, didn't we?

42
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:41,768
I've decided.

43
00:03:42,477 --> 00:03:43,937
Once this mission is over,

44
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,314
I will go apologize to Sung.

45
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:49,817
You couldn't forget it either, right?

46
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,778
We ran away.

47
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,906
A man who prides himself
as a hunter ran away.

48
00:03:55,865 --> 00:03:58,076
{\an8}I did it for my family,

49
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,162
{\an8}but it doesn't change the fact
that I abandoned my companion.

50
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:04,415
{\an8}If we want to continue
claiming to be hunters,

51
00:04:04,499 --> 00:04:06,042
{\an8}we must learn to admit our mistakes.

52
00:04:08,086 --> 00:04:10,255
Will he forgive us?

53
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:12,173
He will never forgive us.

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,550
But I still have to apologize.

55
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:16,552
All right, let's go.

56
00:04:19,138 --> 00:04:20,473
Too weak.

57
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:22,892
Goblins are no match at all.

58
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,435
Finished them all?

59
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,145
It's a piece of cake.

60
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,022
I'm not even satisfied.

61
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,860
What if they were humans?

62
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:33,778
What?

63
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:35,530
Can you do the same?

64
00:04:36,698 --> 00:04:38,992
Humans aren't that different
from these magic beasts.

65
00:04:39,075 --> 00:04:41,119
Yeah, they're all the same.

66
00:04:42,578 --> 00:04:43,997
What do you want from me?

67
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:48,668
Three men violated my daughter.

68
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:51,504
She hanged herself.

69
00:04:51,587 --> 00:04:53,923
My wife ended up in a mental hospital
due to the trauma.

70
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:55,758
But those three guys

71
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:59,012
will be released in a few years
as if nothing had happened.

72
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:00,847
And they…

73
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,432
They still have their hunter licenses.

74
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,476
I've heard that hunters
can get sentence reductions

75
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,353
by participating in raid missions.

76
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:10,523
It's not fair at all!

77
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:13,443
My daughter will never return to me.

78
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:17,447
What is that?

79
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,407
Here's three billion.

80
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:22,702
Please…

81
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:25,288
{\an8}Kill them for me.

82
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:30,626
No outsider would know
what happened in the dungeon, right?

83
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:32,336
I beg you.

84
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,880
Please help me.

85
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:40,845
After leaving here,
I'll report to the Surveillance Team

86
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:43,389
that the three of you

87
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:46,309
encountered 100 goblins here.

88
00:05:47,477 --> 00:05:50,188
This path is really winding.

89
00:05:50,271 --> 00:05:52,106
Are we really going forward?

90
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,358
Did we choose the wrong path?

91
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:55,777
Phew.

92
00:05:58,446 --> 00:06:00,198
Help…

93
00:06:00,281 --> 00:06:02,283
{\an8}Don't expect a quick death.

94
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:06,037
{\an8}I'll torture you as much as possible
before ending your lives.

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,705
{\an8}That's what I was told to do.

96
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,540
What… what are you doing?

97
00:06:12,001 --> 00:06:13,586
The paths are connected?

98
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:14,962
That means

99
00:06:15,046 --> 00:06:17,924
the left path leads to the boss room.

100
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:19,759
That saves me the time to find it.

101
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:20,843
Help me--

102
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:24,806
Although this went
differently than planned…

103
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:32,647
<i>That Kang Taeshik.</i>

104
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,941
<i>He and his superior from the Surveillance
Team visited me at the hospital.</i>

105
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:38,152
<i>I hope he doesn't remember me.</i>

106
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:41,864
-Mr. Song.
-Okay.

107
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:49,705
What happened?

108
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,126
Jungho.

109
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:57,338
Mr. Kang…

110
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,645
Mr. Kim…

111
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:15,815
Joohee… treat them.

112
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:17,608
Go treat them!

113
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:19,485
Yes!

114
00:07:22,655 --> 00:07:24,907
Mr. Kim, pull yourself together.

115
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:28,119
<i>These wounds were not caused
by magic beasts.</i>

116
00:07:28,744 --> 00:07:29,996
<i>They are caused by sharp blades.</i>

117
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,082
<i>Moreover, the enemy avoided
lethal injuries to create more wounds.</i>

118
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,835
It's no use.

119
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:38,045
I can't survive.

120
00:07:38,713 --> 00:07:40,339
What nonsense is that?

121
00:07:41,007 --> 00:07:42,633
You need to be alive.

122
00:07:42,717 --> 00:07:44,051
Don't you have a family?

123
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:46,095
You must…

124
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:49,348
You must live no matter what!

125
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:51,976
Only then can I hate you.

126
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:54,270
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:54,353 --> 00:07:56,439
I am truly sorry.

128
00:07:56,522 --> 00:08:00,568
I didn't want to apologize like this.

129
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:05,114
I wanted to bow my head
and apologize to you.

130
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:06,699
Sung.

131
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:09,076
I am really sorry.

132
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:12,121
Believe me.

133
00:08:20,713 --> 00:08:21,797
Kim.

134
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,476
You're quite agile.

135
00:08:35,603 --> 00:08:38,773
I wanted to take care of the healer first.

136
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:42,610
{\an8}I didn't expect that move to be blocked.

137
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:44,445
Mr. Kang.

138
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:46,030
Did you do this?

139
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:47,323
What if I did?

140
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:50,243
{\an8}Aren't you from the Hunter's Association?

141
00:08:50,785 --> 00:08:51,911
{\an8}How could you do this--

142
00:08:51,994 --> 00:08:53,788
{\an8}I've thought of a good story.

143
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:58,793
I was going to claim
that you were killed by goblins

144
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:00,503
but I want to make a change.

145
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:03,714
{\an8}These criminals attempted to escape.

146
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:05,675
{\an8}They killed you first,

147
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:10,096
{\an8}and ambushed me from behind
when I fought the boss.

148
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:13,224
However, with their strength,
they couldn't harm me.

149
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:15,685
In the end, only I survived.

150
00:09:15,768 --> 00:09:17,520
Perfect, isn't it?

151
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:19,146
You scum.

152
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:21,983
You can't defeat him.

153
00:09:22,066 --> 00:09:23,317
Let me do it.

154
00:09:24,443 --> 00:09:25,778
Kim, lend me your sword.

155
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,740
It's been a long time
since I've crossed swords with someone.

156
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:32,243
<i>He is B-rank, higher than me.</i>

157
00:09:32,326 --> 00:09:33,202
<i>But…</i>

158
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:37,248
Joohee, can you cast
a physical enhancement spell on me?

159
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:38,541
Y-Yes.

160
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:41,877
<i>Assassins usually have low defense,
and that's their weakness.</i>

161
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:44,046
<i>I must target that.</i>

162
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,717
Even if an old mage
had his strength enhanced,

163
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,302
it would only backfire.

164
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:51,679
Right now, I am a swordsman.

165
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:55,933
You are a mage.

166
00:09:56,017 --> 00:09:58,561
{\an8}What's the point of picking up a sword?

167
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:03,899
{\an8}There might be a point.

168
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,027
You have good skills.

169
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:10,031
Although enhanced, your movements
are very skilled in themselves.

170
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,284
<i>Although just for a moment,
Mr. Song caught up to his speed.</i>

171
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:16,120
<i>If he could be a bit faster…</i>

172
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:17,955
Your attack is fast and accurate.

173
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,541
You have the ability to attack
with a sword instead of magic.

174
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:24,045
But that's all there is to it.

175
00:10:28,424 --> 00:10:30,092
That healer is annoying.

176
00:10:30,176 --> 00:10:31,886
{\an8}I should get rid of you first.

177
00:10:36,849 --> 00:10:39,435
Turning your back on a swordsman?

178
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:42,521
Seems like you're no ordinary old man.

179
00:10:42,605 --> 00:10:45,399
After all, I am the master
of an S-rank hunter.

180
00:10:45,983 --> 00:10:48,027
In terms of swordsmanship,
I won't lose to you.

181
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:49,570
That being said,

182
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:51,989
the power you've been granted
is ultimately limited.

183
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,991
A mage

184
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:57,703
can never keep up with an assassin.

185
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,292
Mr. Song.

186
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:06,837
No.

187
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:09,799
The healer has exhausted her power.

188
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,554
It's over.

189
00:11:22,728 --> 00:11:23,646
<i>Did it work?</i>

190
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,067
You posed as a swordsman
to lower my guard against the magic.

191
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:31,862
You unleashed a magical attack just before
I was going to make my final strike.

192
00:11:31,946 --> 00:11:34,198
{\an8}The tactic wasn't bad.

193
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:36,158
{\an8}You cunning old fox.

194
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:37,743
<i>Is it over?</i>

195
00:11:38,786 --> 00:11:39,620
Die.

196
00:11:45,876 --> 00:11:47,378
You again.

197
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:48,879
Who are you?

198
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:51,340
I'm Sung Jinwoo,

199
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:53,008
{\an8}an E-rank hunter.

200
00:11:54,552 --> 00:11:55,386
E-rank?

201
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:57,888
How is that possible?

202
00:11:57,972 --> 00:11:59,890
Sung.

203
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:01,100
What was that just now?

204
00:12:01,183 --> 00:12:03,394
If you are a power-type E-rank hunter,

205
00:12:03,477 --> 00:12:06,105
that strength would make sense.

206
00:12:06,188 --> 00:12:10,025
But you reacted fast enough
to block my attacks twice.

207
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,110
Are you an assassin-type?

208
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:13,487
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

209
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:15,781
You've been hiding your true power, right?

210
00:12:16,282 --> 00:12:18,659
You seem to know each other.

211
00:12:18,742 --> 00:12:20,494
Then you can't be a False Ranker.

212
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:23,038
After all, you wouldn't leave
any witnesses alive.

213
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:26,208
In that case, there's only one answer.

214
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:28,210
{\an8}You're a second awakener.

215
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:29,462
{\an8}Sung is…

216
00:12:29,545 --> 00:12:30,629
{\an8}A second awakener?

217
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:34,758
If that's the case, did it happen
after the double dungeon incident?

218
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:36,260
<i>Double dungeon?</i>

219
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,680
<i>Is he… that lousy E-rank hunter?</i>

220
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:43,934
<i>His appearance and impression
are completely different.</i>

221
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:46,645
<i>And his measured value was only ten.</i>

222
00:12:47,313 --> 00:12:49,190
<i>Did the second awakening
happen after that?</i>

223
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:52,610
<i>If so, how did he survive
the double dungeon?</i>

224
00:12:53,194 --> 00:12:54,320
Well, regardless,

225
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,323
it seems you have
little experience as a hunter.

226
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,534
Let me teach you a thing or two.

227
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:02,620
Why do you do this?

228
00:13:02,703 --> 00:13:04,705
You mean these prisoners?

229
00:13:05,372 --> 00:13:08,042
I was entrusted
by the family of the victim.

230
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:12,213
They basically killed someone
without any remorse.

231
00:13:12,296 --> 00:13:14,089
I'm doing justice.

232
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:16,425
No, I mean Mr. Kim and Mr. Kang.

233
00:13:17,343 --> 00:13:18,552
Why did you kill them?

234
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,971
Was it to silence them?

235
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:22,598
Then you could have made it quick.

236
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:27,228
Yet you avoided inflicting fatal wounds,
as if to torture them.

237
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:30,564
It's for the victim? Cut it out.

238
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,025
That is not your true nature.

239
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:36,820
Yes.

240
00:13:36,904 --> 00:13:38,948
These things are trivial for me.

241
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,325
But you seem to have misunderstood.

242
00:13:42,034 --> 00:13:46,413
I am a B-rank hunter
that many large guilds fight for.

243
00:13:47,248 --> 00:13:51,210
Why do you think I joined Hunter's
Association that pays a meager salary?

244
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:55,172
{\an8}Because compared to killing magic beasts,

245
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:58,300
{\an8}I enjoy killing people more.

246
00:14:01,637 --> 00:14:04,390
Even with a second awakening,
an E-rank hunter can't be very strong.

247
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,935
You're too slow.

248
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:08,894
You're quite fast.

249
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,108
How can he have such skills?

250
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:18,279
He's no longer the Sung I knew.

251
00:14:21,282 --> 00:14:22,908
{\an8}<i>-Our speeds are comparable.
-Our speeds are comparable.</i>

252
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:25,077
<i>Even if we have the same skills</i>

253
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,620
<i>and the same strength,</i>

254
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,998
<i>your experience
against high-level opponents</i>

255
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:30,249
<i>is far too little compared to mine.</i>

256
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:33,419
{\an8}<i>These differences
will lead to your defeat.</i>

257
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,970
You are a tough one.

258
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:44,805
-Excuse me.
-What?

259
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:47,808
Could you please tone down
your killing intent?

260
00:14:48,684 --> 00:14:49,894
Look.

261
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:51,979
The system has responded to you.

262
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,357
Now I have to thank this system.

263
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:59,528
It has given me another reason
why I must kill you.

264
00:14:59,612 --> 00:15:00,696
{\an8}System?

265
00:15:01,322 --> 00:15:02,615
{\an8}<i>What's up with him?</i>

266
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:05,576
<i>I'm the one with the upper hand.</i>

267
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,626
<i>He got even faster.</i>

268
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:15,419
<i>It's poison.</i>

269
00:15:15,502 --> 00:15:17,212
Is this a special effect of your dagger?

270
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,595
Then let me show you
something interesting too.

271
00:15:26,805 --> 00:15:27,640
<i>He disappeared.</i>

272
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:30,559
I had completely concealed my presence.

273
00:15:30,643 --> 00:15:32,353
Your senses are sharp.

274
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:34,271
Skill, Invisibility.

275
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:37,399
It hides one's shape, sound,
and scent, among others.

276
00:15:37,483 --> 00:15:41,737
Even among assassins,
only a very few can acquire this skill.

277
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,531
Of course, those who know
that I can use this skill

278
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:46,367
are nonexistent.

279
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,284
After all,

280
00:15:49,912 --> 00:15:51,830
there hasn't been one

281
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:54,667
who has seen me use this skill
and lived to tell about it.

282
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:57,169
I have sealed your speed.

283
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,463
-Jinwoo.
-Stay put.

284
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:03,008
After I kill him, it's your turn.

285
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:06,011
<i>If this goes on, Sung will…</i>

286
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:09,932
With your foot injured,
can you still dodge my attacks?

287
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:11,558
Hey.

288
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:13,185
Have you said enough?

289
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:14,770
Full Recovery.

290
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:18,941
<i>He recovered instantly.</i>

291
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:21,902
<i>A fighter capable of using healing magic.</i>

292
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:23,278
<i>I've never heard of such a thing.</i>

293
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:25,447
<i>How many times can he use it?</i>

294
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:26,991
<i>I cannot predict it at all.</i>

295
00:16:27,074 --> 00:16:28,492
<i>He's a dangerous one.</i>

296
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:31,036
<i>I've lost another emotion.</i>

297
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:33,789
With scum like you,

298
00:16:33,872 --> 00:16:35,791
it's a waste of time
to get angry, I guess.

299
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:38,252
I see.

300
00:16:38,335 --> 00:16:40,963
{\an8}You've done it, right?

301
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:45,050
You're like me after all.

302
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:46,844
<i>I see.</i>

303
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:51,557
<i>He probably had to make
many difficult choices in a short time.</i>

304
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,768
<i>It isn't just his appearance that changed.</i>

305
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:56,145
Awakening.

306
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:59,523
This power beyond common sense
has changed the rules of the world.

307
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,651
This is a lawless land
belonging only to hunters.

308
00:17:02,735 --> 00:17:04,528
There is no law here.

309
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,947
The strong will win.

310
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:13,746
<i>Can he be</i>

311
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,749
<i>gauging my position
through my killing intent?</i>

312
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,752
<i>But even so,
he still can't pinpoint my exact location.</i>

313
00:17:24,673 --> 00:17:25,924
<i>What… what's happening?</i>

314
00:17:28,177 --> 00:17:29,011
<i>Wait.</i>

315
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:30,471
<i>No way.</i>

316
00:17:34,224 --> 00:17:35,225
How…

317
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:37,519
is it possible?

318
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:46,612
You asked me why I killed, right?

319
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:49,907
It's pointless to apply
ordinary people's views

320
00:17:50,449 --> 00:17:53,452
to hunters who frequently
consort with death.

321
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:55,913
You're the same.

322
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,417
We've both become killing machines.

323
00:18:01,043 --> 00:18:03,879
{\an8}So, I lost and will die.

324
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:06,507
{\an8}It's the logical rule.

325
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:09,051
Who are you?

326
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:13,055
Being an assassin, you're capable
of using healing magic and debuff magic.

327
00:18:13,138 --> 00:18:14,473
I've never heard of that.

328
00:18:14,556 --> 00:18:16,058
Well,

329
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:18,644
I would like to know too.

330
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:25,275
Since you've killed me,

331
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,154
you can no longer hide your identity.

332
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:33,200
What if I were the kind of hunter
who grows constantly in battle?

333
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,122
Your shadow

334
00:18:38,622 --> 00:18:40,666
is already connected to the darkness.

335
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,087
Your power will become
as unfathomable as it.

336
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:48,215
However, you must be careful.

337
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,510
<i>When you stare into the abyss,</i>

338
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:56,598
<i>the abyss stares back at you.</i>

339
00:19:02,938 --> 00:19:04,106
<i>Indeed.</i>

340
00:19:04,189 --> 00:19:06,817
<i>My strength has grown rapidly.</i>

341
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:09,153
<i>But I feel</i>

342
00:19:09,987 --> 00:19:11,530
<i>that as my strength grows,</i>

343
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:14,783
<i>a part of me is gradually falling apart.</i>

344
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,493
Jinwoo.

345
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:18,245
Thank you.

346
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:20,455
You saved us.

347
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:23,167
Without you, we would have died.

348
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,084
It's nothing.

349
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:26,336
Please go ahead and leave.

350
00:19:27,421 --> 00:19:28,755
I need to close up the dungeon.

351
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:29,673
What?

352
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:30,966
You're going alone?

353
00:19:31,675 --> 00:19:33,969
No, we'll do as you say.

354
00:19:34,595 --> 00:19:38,182
It's a pity that we can't
bury Kim and Kang.

355
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:39,641
I'll wait for you outside.

356
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:52,571
{\an8}Chief Woo.

357
00:19:52,654 --> 00:19:54,990
I've heard the report.
Where are the survivors?

358
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:55,908
Over there.

359
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,701
{\an8}<i>Speaking of which,</i>

360
00:19:57,784 --> 00:20:01,455
{\an8}<i>I didn't expect Kang Taeshik
to be involved in murders.</i>

361
00:20:02,581 --> 00:20:04,791
<i>Although I did suspect him,</i>

362
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:07,586
<i>as his superior, I was too careless.</i>

363
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,047
It's these three.

364
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,342
<i>I remember</i>

365
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:15,219
<i>he was that E-rank hunter back then.</i>

366
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:17,179
{\an8}<i>He looks like a different person.</i>

367
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,765
Long time no see.

368
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,642
Um, you're from the Surveillance Team.

369
00:20:21,725 --> 00:20:22,976
Woo Jinchul.

370
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,146
This time, my subordinate
has caused huge trouble.

371
00:20:27,064 --> 00:20:28,148
But first,

372
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:30,859
let me get straight to the point.

373
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,321
Which of you killed Kang Taeshik?

374
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:37,407
<i>It seems I can no longer hide.</i>

375
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:39,243
<i>It's a pity.</i>

376
00:20:39,326 --> 00:20:42,329
<i>My collaboration with Jinho
might have to come to an end.</i>

377
00:20:43,121 --> 00:20:44,289
It was me.

378
00:20:44,915 --> 00:20:47,167
I killed Mr. Kang.

379
00:20:47,793 --> 00:20:49,795
Excuse me, I remember your rank is…

380
00:20:49,878 --> 00:20:51,004
I'm a C-rank hunter.

381
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:54,508
How could a C-rank hunter
manage to kill a B-rank hunter?

382
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:56,760
Because we have her.

383
00:20:58,553 --> 00:20:59,846
I see.

384
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:02,432
So you managed to defeat him
with the healer's assistance.

385
00:21:03,642 --> 00:21:06,144
<i>Kang Taeshik was among
the top of the B-rank hunters.</i>

386
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:09,648
<i>I don't think a C-rank mage could
kill him, no matter how hard he tried.</i>

387
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:12,484
I understand.

388
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:15,654
We need to complete the report.

389
00:21:15,737 --> 00:21:16,947
Please come with me.

390
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:20,784
{\an8}<i>Now is not the time to be smug
about having killed Kang Taeshik.</i>

391
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,120
<i>I couldn't see it at that time.</i>

392
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:24,663
<i>This person is an A-rank hunter.</i>

393
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:27,040
<i>He's not someone I can handle right now.</i>

394
00:21:28,709 --> 00:21:31,253
Was I meddling too much?

395
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:36,174
You must have your reasons
for hiding your strength.

396
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:41,638
All right. Consider it my way
of repaying you for saving my life.

397
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:47,519
<i>Three hours later,</i>

398
00:21:47,602 --> 00:21:51,273
<i>the man who commissioned Kang Taeshik
to kill the prisoners turned himself in.</i>

399
00:21:51,356 --> 00:21:53,734
<i>The whole case was concluded
as legitimate self-defense.</i>

400
00:21:56,361 --> 00:21:57,404
That was exhausting.

401
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,614
Jinwoo.

402
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:02,242
Do you

403
00:22:03,577 --> 00:22:04,911
remember this?
