1
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:09,264
Dongsuk.

2
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:11,516
Why do we make it so complicated?

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,643
We can just kill them there.

4
00:00:14,644 --> 00:00:16,396
Are you an idiot?

5
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:20,150
If we do it there and wake up that spider,
how will we take the mana crystals?

6
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,570
I don't care what his nickname is.

7
00:00:23,653 --> 00:00:26,281
An E-rank hunter and a D-rank hunter
without combat experience

8
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:28,074
will never defeat that boss.

9
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:31,411
We wait for that spider
to eat them and fall asleep again.

10
00:00:31,494 --> 00:00:33,329
Then we can take the mana crystals out.

11
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:36,124
Do we blast it open again
with flash magic?

12
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:38,668
That'll wake up the spider again.

13
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:42,672
<i>There's a small path above the cave.</i>

14
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:44,716
<i>We go down from there.</i>

15
00:00:45,216 --> 00:00:46,968
I see.

16
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:48,720
You are a genius, Dongsuk.

17
00:00:48,803 --> 00:00:50,513
But will it fall asleep?

18
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:53,433
If it doesn't, we'll have to take it down.

19
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:55,852
<i>That guy's name is Yoo Jinho, right?</i>

20
00:00:55,935 --> 00:00:57,854
<i>Did you see his equipment?</i>

21
00:00:57,937 --> 00:01:00,356
<i>Just the sword and shield alone
are worth hundreds of millions.</i>

22
00:01:00,857 --> 00:01:04,861
<i>If we can't take the mana crystals,
we'll take his belongings instead.</i>

23
00:01:05,487 --> 00:01:08,156
Let me see which wealthy family he's from.

24
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:11,242
At least we should attend the funeral.

25
00:01:11,326 --> 00:01:12,619
By the way,

26
00:01:12,702 --> 00:01:18,083
the noise we made when sealing the road
must have infuriated that boss a lot.

27
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,043
Kyuhwan.

28
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:22,921
Do you think you can kill
that beast by yourself?

29
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:25,757
How could I possibly do that?

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,759
Honestly, me neither.

31
00:01:27,842 --> 00:01:30,136
Bosses in dungeons
cannot be underestimated.

32
00:01:32,263 --> 00:01:34,849
In other words, those two

33
00:01:34,933 --> 00:01:38,478
<i>can't possibly leave there alive.</i>

34
00:01:39,103 --> 00:01:40,480
Please wait.

35
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:43,233
At least a B-rank hunter
can defeat a C-rank boss alone.

36
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:46,069
Or a top-tier C-rank hunter.

37
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:48,113
Jinwoo, you can't do it…

38
00:01:49,405 --> 00:01:51,199
Let's find a way to get out.

39
00:01:52,158 --> 00:01:53,868
{\an8}<i>Jinho is right.</i>

40
00:01:53,952 --> 00:01:57,205
{\an8}<i>Even though I've had a second awakening
and leveled up,</i>

41
00:01:57,288 --> 00:01:58,915
{\an8}<i>I am still very weak now.</i>

42
00:01:59,999 --> 00:02:03,670
<i>The Venom-Fanged Kasaka
in the instance dungeon</i>

43
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:04,921
<i>should be D-rank.</i>

44
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:08,758
<i>That Boss Golem
is probably D-rank or lower.</i>

45
00:02:10,468 --> 00:02:14,639
<i>This boss is worlds apart from those.</i>

46
00:02:16,224 --> 00:02:17,308
<i>But why?</i>

47
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,979
<i>I can't feel any pressure
that would frustrate me.</i>

48
00:02:22,147 --> 00:02:26,609
<i>I've become strong enough
to no longer fear a C-rank boss.</i>

49
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:30,280
<i>My current level is 18.</i>

50
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,534
<i>Against a C-rank boss…</i>

51
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,204
<i>I have a chance of fighting it.</i>

52
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,837
<i>Hunters are called hunters for a reason…</i>

53
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:49,507
<i>The real hunt begins now.</i>

54
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:30,441
You've worked hard.

55
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:35,613
Government officials, media,
and energy-related groups…

56
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:39,409
Having meetings with them
for days in a row is truly exhausting.

57
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:43,788
I've never been good
at beating around the bush.

58
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:50,753
I heard you have no plans coming up.

59
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:54,716
If possible, could I ask you
for a sparring match?

60
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:57,927
Perhaps it could change your mood.

61
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:03,474
I am already a withered veteran…

62
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:08,146
but how can I refuse
when a young person seeks my guidance?

63
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:19,407
<i>Its hide is very hard.</i>

64
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,620
<i>Its attack is surprisingly powerful.</i>

65
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:26,831
<i>If I took one hit, I would be dead.</i>

66
00:05:33,254 --> 00:05:34,589
That kind of move…

67
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:36,382
He is definitely not an E-rank hunter.

68
00:05:37,592 --> 00:05:38,634
Who is he?

69
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:41,888
Is he…

70
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,431
a False Ranker?

71
00:05:44,057 --> 00:05:45,767
<i>I've heard about them.</i>

72
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,313
<i>Very few hunters can control their magic
power to deliberately get a lower rating.</i>

73
00:05:50,396 --> 00:05:53,024
<i>They are called False Rankers.</i>

74
00:05:53,524 --> 00:05:55,610
<i>And they are usually</i>

75
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:58,488
<i>psychopaths who take pleasure in killing.</i>

76
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:04,202
Why did I come here?

77
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:06,412
D-Dad…

78
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:13,294
<i>Damn it.</i>

79
00:06:13,377 --> 00:06:15,463
<i>Its hide is too hard,
I can't harm it at all.</i>

80
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:18,674
<i>My fatigue…</i>

81
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:20,593
<i>If it keeps increasing,
it will slow me down.</i>

82
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,554
<i>I need to get rid of it
before that happens.</i>

83
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:25,515
<i>Paralysis and drain.</i>

84
00:06:26,224 --> 00:06:28,976
<i>This dagger's special abilities
are key to victory.</i>

85
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,437
<i>It'll take effect if I hit its weak spot.</i>

86
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:32,647
<i>That's the spot!</i>

87
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:39,487
Acid.

88
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,405
It had this trick too.

89
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,075
<i>Tough hide and the strong acid…</i>

90
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:46,619
<i>It's tougher to deal with than I expected.</i>

91
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,831
{\an8}<i>If this continues,
I have no chance of winning.</i>

92
00:06:50,915 --> 00:06:53,334
<i>I have to close the distance between us.</i>

93
00:06:54,502 --> 00:06:56,087
<i>The new skill Dash.</i>

94
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,423
<i>Use this move to get to it.</i>

95
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:15,022
<i>If it doesn't work once,</i>

96
00:07:15,106 --> 00:07:16,732
<i>then I'll try again!</i>

97
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:20,403
<i>He's so fast.</i>

98
00:07:20,903 --> 00:07:23,072
<i>But can his vitality hold up?</i>

99
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:25,324
<i>What on earth is he planning?</i>

100
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:29,412
<i>Faster.</i>

101
00:07:31,247 --> 00:07:32,540
<i>Even faster.</i>

102
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:36,627
{\an8}<i>Almost there…</i>

103
00:07:42,008 --> 00:07:42,884
Jinwoo!

104
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:02,236
Jinwoo!

105
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:52,286
<i>Thankfully I didn't claim
the rewards for the daily quest.</i>

106
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:55,498
<i>Otherwise, I can't even imagine
the consequences.</i>

107
00:08:57,959 --> 00:08:59,669
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

108
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:02,255
<i>He defeated the boss all by himself.</i>

109
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:04,840
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

110
00:09:05,424 --> 00:09:08,052
<i>He's a False Ranker.</i>

111
00:09:08,886 --> 00:09:11,556
How much is this worth?

112
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:14,934
Well… Sir.

113
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,980
Do you need me to help you
with the magic gem?

114
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:21,649
I can carry the luggage too.

115
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,570
Have some water, sir.

116
00:09:25,653 --> 00:09:26,612
Thank…

117
00:09:27,822 --> 00:09:29,407
<i>Why is he suddenly calling me that?</i>

118
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,576
Please take a rest, sir.

119
00:09:31,659 --> 00:09:34,036
I'll mine the mana crystals.

120
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:38,291
<i>What's with this kid?</i>

121
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:42,420
They are still alive.

122
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:04,150
Are you okay?

123
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:05,276
Yes.

124
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:07,153
Thank you for your guidance.

125
00:10:07,236 --> 00:10:10,406
I've relaxed a lot.

126
00:10:11,032 --> 00:10:12,366
Thank you.

127
00:10:12,992 --> 00:10:14,285
You're amazing, President.

128
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:16,662
There's no sign
of a decline in your skills.

129
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:20,333
No, I'm no longer as good as I used to be.

130
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,253
Jinchul, your moves have improved.

131
00:10:24,337 --> 00:10:26,172
It seems you've done a lot of training.

132
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:31,677
Training can't increase hunters' rank,
but it can improve their skills.

133
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,389
{\an8}Don't take pride in the hunter's strength.

134
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:38,267
{\an8}Having physical and mental training
is indeed important.

135
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:41,937
{\an8}Especially if you're going
to a dangerous place like a dungeon.

136
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,649
{\an8}After all, in such places,

137
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:48,736
<i>you see the worst of people.</i>

138
00:10:50,112 --> 00:10:51,364
Is the boss dead?

139
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:53,574
This spider is all bark and no bite.

140
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:54,742
What a crap.

141
00:10:54,825 --> 00:10:58,454
With his equipment,
defeating a C-rank boss isn't impossible.

142
00:10:58,537 --> 00:11:02,458
Even so, it's embarrassing
to lose to a D-rank hunter.

143
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,960
Dongsuk, what should we do?

144
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,671
What else?

145
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:08,381
Yoo Jinho.

146
00:11:09,006 --> 00:11:11,217
I looked you up
because of your expensive equipment.

147
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,718
You are no ordinary person.

148
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,389
The president of Yoojin Construction,
Yoo Myunghan.

149
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:17,848
He's your dad, right?

150
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:20,976
So what?

151
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,645
I'll give you a chance.

152
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:25,272
Kill Sung Jinwoo.

153
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:26,190
What?

154
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,901
You know what we do, right?

155
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:31,112
We kill those useless ones
who just come to fill numbers

156
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:34,198
to take the spoils for ourselves.

157
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:35,408
Yoo Jinho.

158
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,618
I want you to be our accomplice.

159
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:39,620
If you do, I'll spare you.

160
00:11:39,703 --> 00:11:40,955
How can I…

161
00:11:41,038 --> 00:11:45,126
{\an8}<i>That young master killed a C-rank boss
on his own with that equipment.</i>

162
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:47,878
{\an8}<i>It'll be troublesome
if that equipment has special effects.</i>

163
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:51,799
{\an8}If you refuse, you can die together.

164
00:11:53,217 --> 00:11:54,176
What's wrong?

165
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,262
What's there to hesitate about?

166
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:58,681
No one will know what happened here.

167
00:11:59,181 --> 00:12:02,643
Are you afraid of that E-rank trash?

168
00:12:22,037 --> 00:12:23,497
What?

169
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:25,624
Are you taking his side?

170
00:12:29,003 --> 00:12:31,172
Dongsuk, what do we do now?

171
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:32,923
You start with the weaker one.

172
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:34,967
Have you two

173
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,096
ever killed people?

174
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:45,352
<i>Urgent quest?</i>

175
00:12:46,061 --> 00:12:47,480
<i>What's going on?</i>

176
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,649
Pay attention here.

177
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:51,609
Take this!

178
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:00,284
Jinwoo!

179
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:07,291
Heejin.

180
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:12,755
Long time no see.

181
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:15,841
What's going on
at the White Tiger Guild lately?

182
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:19,011
Nothing much. It's the same as usual.

183
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:21,138
How about your Hunters Guild, Gina?

184
00:13:21,222 --> 00:13:23,807
The same as usual too.

185
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:29,355
By the way, you went to Hunter Cha's
A-rank dungeon training, right?

186
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:30,689
How did it go?

187
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:32,399
It was awesome.

188
00:13:32,483 --> 00:13:33,859
It ended in an instant.

189
00:13:34,443 --> 00:13:37,530
<i>Those A-rank magic beasts
we struggled with…</i>

190
00:13:42,493 --> 00:13:44,203
<i>were instantly taken down by her.</i>

191
00:13:45,538 --> 00:13:48,165
<i>She defeated enemies effortlessly.</i>

192
00:13:48,249 --> 00:13:50,417
<i>Needless to say, we were surprised.</i>

193
00:13:50,501 --> 00:13:53,003
<i>Kihoon was quite shocked.</i>

194
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:57,091
Because his goal was
to become the next Captain.

195
00:13:57,174 --> 00:13:59,343
He's such a hard worker.

196
00:13:59,426 --> 00:14:01,512
What about your Kim Chul?

197
00:14:01,595 --> 00:14:04,515
Doesn't he have the same goal?
He also wants to be the Captain.

198
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:07,184
He's not a bad guy, but…

199
00:14:07,268 --> 00:14:09,812
That says it all.

200
00:14:10,437 --> 00:14:13,816
But after all, we are pretty lucky

201
00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:18,404
as we are able to join large guilds
like Hunters Guild and White Tiger Guild.

202
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:19,738
That's true.

203
00:14:19,822 --> 00:14:20,781
Right.

204
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:25,119
After all, there are ominous rumors
in some places.

205
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:27,121
Ominous rumors?

206
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:30,833
The teams with an abnormally
high casualty rate.

207
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:31,917
Something like that.

208
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,715
Yoo Jinho, he's dead.

209
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:41,302
How could you do that?

210
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,098
<i>How could I forget?</i>

211
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:49,935
<i>This is a place that believes
in the survival of the fittest,</i>

212
00:14:50,644 --> 00:14:54,064
<i>a place full of violence and deceit.</i>

213
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:59,570
<i>How could I…</i>

214
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:05,034
<i>How could I…</i>

215
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,078
<i>I see.</i>

216
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:09,538
<i>I've become numb,</i>

217
00:15:10,539 --> 00:15:14,209
<i>careless, arrogant, and deluded.</i>

218
00:15:17,171 --> 00:15:18,380
<i>Enemies.</i>

219
00:15:18,964 --> 00:15:22,134
<i>The system is forcing me to kill people.</i>

220
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:26,013
<i>Does that mean it doesn't want me to die?</i>

221
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:30,100
<i>This is neither coincidence nor kindness.</i>

222
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,188
<i>The system needs me.</i>

223
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:40,611
<i>I must be strong.</i>

224
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:43,614
Thank goodness.

225
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:46,784
Hey, he's still alive.

226
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:50,079
I see.

227
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:54,583
The system is using me.

228
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,211
And I am using the system too.

229
00:15:58,003 --> 00:16:00,589
Hey, Kyuhwan, don't hold back.

230
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:03,842
How could I forget?

231
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:06,762
The weak will have everything
taken from them.

232
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:08,597
This place is just like that.

233
00:16:08,681 --> 00:16:10,391
You understand it very well.

234
00:16:10,474 --> 00:16:13,018
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

235
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:14,812
That means…

236
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:18,065
You're also mentally prepared, right?

237
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:21,235
Huh? What are you saying?

238
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:23,320
I'm asking

239
00:16:24,863 --> 00:16:28,784
whether you're also prepared to be hunted.

240
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:32,955
Dongsuk, let me do it.

241
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:34,623
Buddy.

242
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:37,418
It seems like you don't quite
understand the situation.

243
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:39,920
Mentally prepared to be hunted?

244
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:43,507
What can a boastful E-rank hunter do?

245
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,634
The Weakest Hunter of All…

246
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,606
The first one.

247
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,816
J-Juntae.

248
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:01,942
No way.

249
00:17:02,026 --> 00:17:03,819
When did he have a weapon in his hand?

250
00:17:03,902 --> 00:17:05,904
Where did he hide it?

251
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:08,907
<i>Even if he was careless,
Juntae was still a D-rank hunter.</i>

252
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:11,243
<i>How could an E-rank hunter
manage to kill him?</i>

253
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:16,498
<i>I killed someone…</i>

254
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:18,000
<i>I killed…</i>

255
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,712
<i>I am following the system's instructions,</i>

256
00:17:22,504 --> 00:17:26,425
<i>but the fact is…</i><i>I killed someone.</i>

257
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:29,887
<i>But if I don't, I will be the one to die.</i>

258
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,723
<i>There's no turning back now.</i>

259
00:17:34,516 --> 00:17:37,519
{\an8}<i>Since only the strong can survive…</i>

260
00:17:38,353 --> 00:17:39,730
Go to hell!

261
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:42,232
-Die!
-Die!

262
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:52,993
How can an E-rank hunter have such skills?

263
00:17:53,702 --> 00:17:55,120
You little…

264
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:01,168
Kyuhwan!

265
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:02,211
Yes.

266
00:18:09,635 --> 00:18:10,719
Take this!

267
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:20,145
So strong.

268
00:18:21,105 --> 00:18:25,109
I think he's even stronger
than he was when fighting the boss.

269
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:28,112
You wiped out
my team members in an instant.

270
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:30,823
You've been hiding your ability.

271
00:18:30,906 --> 00:18:33,367
You defeated the boss too, didn't you?

272
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:38,330
{\an8}But even if I'm also a C-rank hunter,
I'm not the same as them.

273
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,249
Enhancement!

274
00:18:44,795 --> 00:18:46,839
<i>Even if he is as strong as a demon,</i>

275
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:50,968
<i>he must be exhausted
after fighting the boss and five hunters.</i>

276
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:55,264
<i>He relies on his speed
and the special abilities of that dagger.</i>

277
00:18:55,347 --> 00:18:58,976
<i>But my enhanced body is as hard as steel.</i>

278
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,227
<i>Your dagger</i>

279
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:01,687
{\an8}<i>won't work on me.</i>

280
00:19:03,313 --> 00:19:05,816
Take this!

281
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:09,444
Captain Hwang, you're indeed strong.

282
00:19:11,113 --> 00:19:13,615
But let me tell you something.

283
00:19:18,495 --> 00:19:19,997
That is…

284
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,999
I am always leveling up.

285
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,794
<i>What… happened?</i>

286
00:19:25,878 --> 00:19:28,797
<i>He… knocked me to the ground.</i>

287
00:19:29,506 --> 00:19:33,093
<i>This guy is in no way an E-rank hunter.</i>

288
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:36,221
Wait! Don't kill me.

289
00:19:36,305 --> 00:19:37,181
Please spare me.

290
00:19:37,264 --> 00:19:38,849
Money… I'll give you money.

291
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:40,934
All the mana crystals and magic gems here.

292
00:19:41,018 --> 00:19:42,644
You keep all of them.

293
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,980
Is it not enough?

294
00:19:45,063 --> 00:19:45,898
I understand.

295
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:48,150
I'll double the money for you. I'll pay--

296
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:49,193
Three times…

297
00:19:50,277 --> 00:19:52,821
You tried to kill me three times…

298
00:19:53,947 --> 00:19:55,616
{\an8}and you're begging me to spare your life?

299
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:57,409
S-Stop!

300
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:59,703
Do you think you can get away with this?

301
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:03,415
No one will know
what happened in the dungeon.

302
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:05,167
You said it.

303
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,961
{\an8}You bastard!

304
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,963
{\an8}Do you know who my brother is--

305
00:20:25,687 --> 00:20:27,689
After the boss dies,
the dungeon will begin to close.

306
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:28,774
Let's get out quickly.

307
00:20:35,906 --> 00:20:38,909
{\an8}All C-rank hunters have perished.

308
00:20:38,992 --> 00:20:44,456
{\an8}The survivors are a D-rank hunter
and an E-rank hunter?

309
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:46,250
That's right.

310
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,292
Well…

311
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:49,503
You.

312
00:20:49,586 --> 00:20:50,754
Yes.

313
00:20:50,837 --> 00:20:52,256
That sword in your hand

314
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:54,383
is the Claymore Kallion
from the Maya Company, right?

315
00:20:54,466 --> 00:20:56,385
It just hit the market.

316
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:57,719
Yeah.

317
00:20:58,303 --> 00:21:00,389
<i>I didn't know there'd be rewards too.</i>

318
00:21:01,014 --> 00:21:03,392
<i>"Skill: Murderous Intent."</i>

319
00:21:04,434 --> 00:21:07,854
<i>All abilities will be halved?</i>

320
00:21:07,938 --> 00:21:11,024
I see. If you are using that equipment,
I can understand.

321
00:21:11,775 --> 00:21:17,447
You defeated the boss alone
and this E-rank hunter hid away, right?

322
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:23,829
Thank you for your help today.

323
00:21:23,912 --> 00:21:25,664
The investigation ends here.

324
00:21:27,124 --> 00:21:28,250
Well…

325
00:21:29,001 --> 00:21:32,879
Th-Thank you, sir.

326
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:34,965
Yeah.

327
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:43,390
Is something wrong?

328
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:44,975
No.

329
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,272
I was just thinking
thankfully I had her take an umbrella.
