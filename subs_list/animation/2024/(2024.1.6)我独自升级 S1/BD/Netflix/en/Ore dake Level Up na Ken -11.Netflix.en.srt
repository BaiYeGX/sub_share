1
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:11,224
I'm quite far from the city.
This should suffice.

2
00:00:11,933 --> 00:00:13,893
After all, nobody knows what might happen.

3
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:16,563
<i>Job-change quest.</i>

4
00:00:17,647 --> 00:00:20,984
<i>This quest appeared
when I reached level 40.</i>

5
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:25,905
<i>There have been two dungeons
that are opened with keys.</i>

6
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:29,117
<i>Aside from penalties and urgent quests,</i>

7
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:32,620
<i>this is the first time
the system directly intervenes.</i>

8
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:36,958
<i>And this quest
is different from the others.</i>

9
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,753
<i>I can choose whether to accept
and when to start.</i>

10
00:00:40,503 --> 00:00:42,672
<i>Does it suggest it's that challenging?</i>

11
00:00:43,923 --> 00:00:45,383
<i>Generally speaking,</i>

12
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:48,428
<i>this quest should reward me
with professional skills.</i>

13
00:00:50,805 --> 00:00:52,599
<i>I can become stronger.</i>

14
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:56,936
Yes.

15
00:01:09,824 --> 00:01:11,868
{\an8}Damn, I haven't completed
the daily quest yet.

16
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:14,621
{\an8}Fine, I'll do it when I get back.

17
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:16,873
All right.

18
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:20,460
I finally feel like the game has started.

19
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:23,963
I wonder what awaits me inside.

20
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:26,132
How exciting.

21
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:20,496
Sorry, I'm late.

22
00:03:21,247 --> 00:03:23,583
No, you are right on time, Jinsung.

23
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:26,753
Long time no see, Jinho.

24
00:03:27,253 --> 00:03:28,129
Brother.

25
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:35,011
This dungeon is more ordinary
than I imagined.

26
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:41,476
I can't use potions
and Full Recovery here?

27
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:44,812
{\an8}I can't leave until I complete it.

28
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,440
{\an8}I have to be cautious.

29
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:00,411
An armor-type monster?

30
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:19,430
<i>My attack has no effect?</i>

31
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:35,947
It's useless?

32
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:41,035
Enemies with a hard shell…

33
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,377
I've faced them before!

34
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,389
I wasted a Fatal Strike.

35
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:04,767
Here, neither my injury
nor my mana will recover.

36
00:05:06,185 --> 00:05:07,020
However…

37
00:05:08,313 --> 00:05:11,774
{\an8}Of course you guys don't care, do you?

38
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:16,779
What's the matter, Jinho?

39
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,699
You're not eating.

40
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:21,159
Ah, nothing.

41
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:23,578
Jinsung.

42
00:05:23,661 --> 00:05:25,663
How's the progress with the guild?

43
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:30,877
I've heard that S-rank hunters
have refused to join.

44
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:35,840
Indeed, Min Byung-gu and Cha Hae-In
both declined our invitation.

45
00:05:35,923 --> 00:05:37,133
But it doesn't affect our plan.

46
00:05:38,051 --> 00:05:42,513
We are negotiating with hunters
from Europe and the Middle East.

47
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,476
They will join us
if we offer enough money.

48
00:05:46,559 --> 00:05:48,895
After all, there's the precedent
set by Hunter Hwang Dongsoo.

49
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:49,812
That's true.

50
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,774
<i>Abroad… I see.</i>

51
00:05:55,568 --> 00:05:56,402
Jinho.

52
00:05:58,196 --> 00:06:01,115
I know you are up to something.

53
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:04,577
You've been bidding high prices
for numerous C-rank raid missions

54
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,038
to try to make your achievements.

55
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,999
It doesn't matter if it's for fun,
but remember…

56
00:06:11,584 --> 00:06:13,211
don't get in my way.

57
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,301
<i>Brother doesn't know how strong Jinwoo is.</i>

58
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:22,720
<i>With Jinwoo's strength,</i>

59
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:23,805
<i>I can…</i>

60
00:06:32,605 --> 00:06:34,857
I'm getting tired from fighting non-stop.

61
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,776
Now I can take a break--

62
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:40,696
Stealth?

63
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:43,783
They even know how to use Stealth?

64
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:49,455
Next is a mage.

65
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,457
And he's using flash magic.

66
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,793
Stealth and flash magic.

67
00:06:53,876 --> 00:06:55,002
What's with this place?

68
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:56,838
That hard shell like Kasaka's…

69
00:06:57,421 --> 00:07:00,216
<i>It's like a review of my past battles.</i>

70
00:07:03,344 --> 00:07:05,471
This quest is harder than I thought.

71
00:07:07,515 --> 00:07:10,518
<i>I must use different abilities to deal
with different types of monsters.</i>

72
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,188
<i>I should use strength for knights,
perception for assassins,</i>

73
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:15,440
<i>and agility for archers.</i>

74
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,819
<i>Without strength, I can't damage knights.</i>

75
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,575
<i>If my perception is too low,
I can't detect assassins.</i>

76
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:28,828
<i>But the bigger problem</i>

77
00:07:28,911 --> 00:07:29,996
<i>is the mage.</i>

78
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,166
<i>They should be dealt with intelligence.</i>

79
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:35,251
<i>Sadly, I haven't invested much
in intelligence.</i>

80
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,587
<i>As a result, my mana is insufficient.</i>

81
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,464
<i>Although I want to conserve my skills…</i>

82
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:45,261
{\an8}<i>my fatigue is accumulating.</i>

83
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:47,263
<i>I need to finish this quickly.</i>

84
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,987
So, is everyone here?

85
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:06,115
Finally.

86
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,919
Even a thing like this is valuable.

87
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:20,087
Fortunately, I could get some
from monsters.

88
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,593
High-rank knight's chestplate?

89
00:08:26,177 --> 00:08:28,763
Right, I've never tried on the equipment.

90
00:08:34,393 --> 00:08:36,646
They can turn invisible?

91
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:38,731
Great. The equipment
doesn't change my appearance.

92
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:42,902
Nor do they hinder my movements.

93
00:08:43,986 --> 00:08:46,614
It's hard to feel that
since I can't use Full Recovery now,

94
00:08:47,114 --> 00:08:48,324
but I've leveled up.

95
00:08:49,325 --> 00:08:51,244
I obtained some items and gold coins

96
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:53,496
and my fatigue has also recovered.

97
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:57,458
It should be about time I move on.

98
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,634
Okay.

99
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:11,138
{\an8}How strong will my opponent
behind this door be?

100
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:19,313
{\an8}<i>Since I can't leave without defeating him,
I have to go forward.</i>

101
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:28,948
<i>This terrifying aura.</i>

102
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,051
Is this the king's hall?

103
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:00,229
<i>My eyes, ears, fingertips…</i>

104
00:10:01,022 --> 00:10:02,523
<i>and my whole body remember this,</i>

105
00:10:03,482 --> 00:10:07,069
<i>the same aura I felt
in the double dungeon.</i>

106
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:15,161
<i>The source of this astonishing aura</i>

107
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:17,079
<i>is him?</i>

108
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:20,875
<i>"Knight Commander, Igris the Bloodred."</i>

109
00:10:22,084 --> 00:10:23,419
<i>His name is in crimson.</i>

110
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:27,340
<i>He's obviously on a different level
from the other beasts.</i>

111
00:10:29,258 --> 00:10:31,636
<i>A knight who defends the empty throne.</i>

112
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:39,435
<i>He's coming.</i>

113
00:10:48,194 --> 00:10:51,280
<i>He chops pillars
as easily as snapping a twig.</i>

114
00:11:00,164 --> 00:11:01,999
<i>Being strong is an understatement.</i>

115
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:15,805
{\an8}<i>He wears such cumbersome armor,
yet he moves so fast.</i>

116
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:18,015
<i>He's incredibly strong.</i>

117
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:31,028
{\an8}<i> I can't cut through.</i>

118
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,252
<i>I can reach his speed,</i>

119
00:11:46,794 --> 00:11:48,421
<i>but he's extremely destructive.</i>

120
00:11:50,172 --> 00:11:52,049
<i>My dagger can't penetrate his armor.</i>

121
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,511
<i>Can I really defeat him?</i>

122
00:11:57,138 --> 00:11:59,181
<i>A strong enemy beyond my imagination.</i>

123
00:12:00,099 --> 00:12:00,933
<i>However…</i>

124
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,520
I don't think I can defeat you unarmed,

125
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:08,065
but this is the only way
to cause internal damage

126
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:09,900
through the armor.

127
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,410
Is this what they call chivalry?

128
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:22,455
You underestimate me?

129
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:28,294
Come in.

130
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,047
President, are you not going home yet?

131
00:12:32,548 --> 00:12:34,216
I don't want to go back yet.

132
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:37,803
So I stayed to handle some other work.

133
00:12:37,887 --> 00:12:38,971
Same for me.

134
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:42,099
I've completed extra work too.

135
00:12:44,477 --> 00:12:45,603
It's finally starting.

136
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:49,857
Speaking of the devil.

137
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,277
It's me. Are you setting off now?

138
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,195
<i>Yes.</i>

139
00:12:54,278 --> 00:12:56,489
I want to thank you first

140
00:12:56,572 --> 00:13:00,618
for agreeing to this operation.

141
00:13:01,118 --> 00:13:02,661
<i>You don't need to thank me.</i>

142
00:13:03,245 --> 00:13:06,499
{\an8}This is the result of you repeatedly
mentioning the Jeju Island incident

143
00:13:06,582 --> 00:13:09,752
{\an8}on TV interviews and magazine features.

144
00:13:10,336 --> 00:13:12,838
That's how the public
remembered the tragedy,

145
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,965
and their attitude was changed.

146
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:19,637
I am simply adding
a bit of momentum to the tide.

147
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:22,890
<i>Won't they criticize you
for looking for trouble?</i>

148
00:13:23,474 --> 00:13:25,351
I'm well-prepared for that.

149
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,436
But you must be careful.

150
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,355
Jeju Island is a dangerous area.

151
00:13:29,855 --> 00:13:31,690
<i>I know that very well.</i>

152
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:34,318
Our mission this time is reconnaissance.

153
00:13:34,902 --> 00:13:38,739
We'll launch a minor attack
to probe the enemy's strength and size.

154
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:41,492
<i>I admire your effort.</i>

155
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:44,245
The third Jeju Island raid mission,

156
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,206
for me,

157
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:50,793
{\an8}is still not over.

158
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:01,053
<i>He's fast.</i>

159
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:26,287
<i>I was on the defensive,</i>

160
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,622
<i>but I think I still lost
500 points of vitality.</i>

161
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:31,584
<i>It was the right decision to wear armor.</i>

162
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:35,880
<i>If he had hit me directly,
I could have been killed on the spot.</i>

163
00:14:37,047 --> 00:14:39,133
<i>He has such strength even without a sword.</i>

164
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,968
<i>He's too strong.</i>

165
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,807
<i>If I can't match his strength,</i>

166
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:48,434
<i>I'll increase my speed.</i>

167
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:06,911
<i>I can't catch up.</i>

168
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:16,003
<i>The passive skill
has increased my defense.</i>

169
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:34,623
That should do it.

170
00:17:29,386 --> 00:17:30,262
I…

171
00:17:31,889 --> 00:17:32,848
I haven't

172
00:17:33,766 --> 00:17:37,019
lost yet!

173
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:00,125
<i>That dagger cannot be transferred.</i>

174
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:02,252
<i>It will go back into the inventory,</i>

175
00:18:02,336 --> 00:18:03,378
<i>and come back to me!</i>

176
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:07,925
<i>I stabbed too shallow.</i>

177
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,134
<i>I need to stab deeper.</i>

178
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:40,999
I won… right?

179
00:18:46,088 --> 00:18:48,090
That was really close.

180
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:52,719
<i>I was lucky to defeat him.</i>

181
00:18:53,345 --> 00:18:56,390
<i>In terms of skill, strength,
and experience,</i>

182
00:18:56,974 --> 00:18:59,726
<i>I am not his match in any aspect.</i>

183
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:02,229
If I had made a mistake,
I would have died.

184
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:05,691
Four rewards?

185
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,735
A pouch carrying 1,500,000 gold coins.

186
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:12,656
The same helmet as Igris'.

187
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:14,158
It's an S-rank item!

188
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:17,244
The Demon Castle's Key is also S-rank,

189
00:19:17,327 --> 00:19:20,205
but this is my first S-rank gear.

190
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:23,876
It reduces physical damage by 15%

191
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,712
and increases vitality and strength
by another 20 points.

192
00:19:26,795 --> 00:19:27,838
That's awesome.

193
00:19:28,714 --> 00:19:31,300
And the stone Ruler's Hand.

194
00:19:31,884 --> 00:19:33,010
What kind of skill is this?

195
00:19:34,136 --> 00:19:35,470
Never mind. I'll find out later.

196
00:19:37,598 --> 00:19:38,640
Aside from those…

197
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,851
Instant teleportation stone?

198
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,604
It can't go back into the inventory.

199
00:19:44,271 --> 00:19:46,982
Why does it appear now?

200
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:49,985
Is it because

201
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:52,321
this job-change quest

202
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:55,073
is still not over?

203
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,709
The longer I hold out, the more points?

204
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,586
What's a high-class job?

205
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:12,507
"Good luck"?

206
00:20:14,051 --> 00:20:15,302
An infinite number of enemies?

207
00:20:20,891 --> 00:20:22,935
<i>If they are of Igris' level,</i>

208
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:25,062
<i>I might not last even a few seconds.</i>

209
00:20:26,063 --> 00:20:29,107
<i>But my current ability is
more than enough for these ones.</i>

210
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:32,486
<i>But, there are too many.</i>

211
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:49,586
<i>Damn it.</i>

212
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,046
<i>No matter how many I kill,</i>

213
00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:53,215
<i>they keep coming out of the gate.</i>

214
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:57,678
<i>The key to this quest
is how long I can hold out.</i>

215
00:20:58,178 --> 00:20:59,012
<i>In that case…</i>

216
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:03,600
<i>Activating Stealth takes 200 mana.</i>

217
00:21:04,226 --> 00:21:06,270
<i>Afterwards, it costs one mana per second.</i>

218
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,273
{\an8}<i>I have 190 mana left.</i>

219
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:12,484
<i>I must buy as much time as possible.</i>

220
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:18,407
<i>My Stealth has been detected?</i>

221
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,334
<i>I didn't expect that.</i>

222
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:31,920
<i>Both Stealth and Murderous Intent
are now useless.</i>

223
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:39,678
<i>How long has it been?</i>

224
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:42,389
<i>Only five minutes?</i>

225
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:44,266
<i>I have no chance.</i>

226
00:21:44,349 --> 00:21:46,310
<i>I'll have to use the teleportation stone.</i>
