1
00:00:03,925 --> 00:00:05,051
Did you see it?

2
00:00:05,135 --> 00:00:05,969
I did.

3
00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:07,262
That E-rank hunter, right?

4
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:11,516
He's getting in shape, right?

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,477
His looks are average, but he is cute.

6
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:19,858
The type that surprises you
when he undresses?

7
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:21,818
Since when did we have someone like that?

8
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,403
I completely missed it.

9
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,783
He was unremarkable at first.

10
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:32,328
But he has been in shape
since he started working out.

11
00:00:32,412 --> 00:00:33,413
Really?

12
00:00:33,496 --> 00:00:35,749
Can people gain muscles so quickly?

13
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:38,084
Excuse me.

14
00:00:38,626 --> 00:00:39,669
Mr. Sung Jinwoo.

15
00:00:43,965 --> 00:00:44,883
Sorry.

16
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:47,469
No, I should apologize.

17
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:52,515
<i>His muscles are so firm.</i>

18
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:58,188
<i>Did he have such a good physique before?</i>

19
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:00,648
What do you want to tell me?

20
00:01:00,732 --> 00:01:02,275
Ah, right.

21
00:01:02,358 --> 00:01:04,444
Today is your day of discharge.

22
00:01:04,527 --> 00:01:05,779
Do you have any discomfort?

23
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:07,947
No, thanks to you, I've fully recovered.

24
00:01:08,031 --> 00:01:09,157
I see.

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,660
Then, please complete the procedures
at the counter later.

26
00:01:12,744 --> 00:01:13,578
Okay.

27
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:14,662
Thank you for everything.

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,917
-Well…
-Yes?

29
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:22,670
Could you give me your contact?

30
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:24,506
Contact?

31
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:25,590
Yes.

32
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:27,467
If you don't mind.

33
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:31,179
<i>Will they inform me of the examination
results after my discharge?</i>

34
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:32,180
I understand.

35
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:10,028
<i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

36
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:12,280
<i>This is our special guest for today.</i>

37
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:14,532
<i>Hello, I'm Baek Yoonho.</i>

38
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:19,662
Hunter Baek is one
of the seven S-rank hunters

39
00:03:19,746 --> 00:03:22,123
and has had impressive achievements.

40
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:26,711
What kind of life do you lead
when you're not on missions?

41
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:29,631
Well, it's mainly training.

42
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:31,633
Daily training is indispensable.

43
00:03:31,716 --> 00:03:34,928
If I don't simulate actual combat,

44
00:03:35,011 --> 00:03:36,387
my skills would get rusty.

45
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:37,722
Every day?

46
00:03:37,805 --> 00:03:39,432
Is it not tiring?

47
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:43,019
I was a firefighter before.

48
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:45,730
I'm used to regular training.

49
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:49,817
A small mistake of mine
could endanger my companions' lives.

50
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:52,445
<i>That always makes me tense up.</i>

51
00:03:52,528 --> 00:03:53,655
<i>I see.</i>

52
00:03:55,323 --> 00:03:56,950
It's so late?

53
00:03:59,661 --> 00:04:01,287
Brother.

54
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:03,206
Jinah, morning.

55
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:04,290
You're up?

56
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:06,459
I've been up for a while.

57
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:08,378
Be careful on the road.

58
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:12,882
The meal I made yesterday
is in the fridge…

59
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:16,219
Brother, have you been working out?

60
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,680
Uh… a little.

61
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:21,224
Have you gotten taller too?

62
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:22,642
Is it because of working out?

63
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:26,354
Men can grow after
they've reached adulthood, huh?

64
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,359
I'm heading out.

65
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:33,611
Hey,

66
00:04:34,404 --> 00:04:36,114
you forgot the umbrella.

67
00:04:36,197 --> 00:04:38,574
The weather is nice.
I'm not taking the heavy umbrella.

68
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:40,326
It's not heavy.

69
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,537
I said no.

70
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,622
Better safe than sorry.

71
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:45,540
Go.

72
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:48,376
Geez, I'm leaving.

73
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:49,460
Be careful.

74
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:55,842
I'll run later.

75
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:59,512
The muscle I've gained
must be due to the ability stats.

76
00:05:00,305 --> 00:05:03,975
If I keep training,
I might become a bodybuilder.

77
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:08,896
I still have some points left.

78
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,399
Which one should I choose?

79
00:05:12,108 --> 00:05:14,319
I need strength to increase damage.

80
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:17,155
But it's pointless
if I can't hit the target.

81
00:05:17,238 --> 00:05:18,990
Then I need to improve agility.

82
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:21,659
I'll boost both strength and agility.

83
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:23,661
It's also good to enhance vitality.

84
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:25,413
Perception is useful too.

85
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:26,831
As for intelligence…

86
00:05:26,914 --> 00:05:30,084
It feels related to magic. Do I need it?

87
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:32,879
Okay, I've decided.

88
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:35,631
That should do it.

89
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:40,136
Hello, this is Sung Jinwoo.

90
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:41,679
<i>You finally answered the phone.</i>

91
00:05:41,763 --> 00:05:44,432
{\an8}Sorry, I was hospitalized.

92
00:05:44,515 --> 00:05:46,392
{\an8}I need to pay the rent, right?

93
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:47,310
{\an8}<i>Yes.</i>

94
00:05:47,393 --> 00:05:49,896
{\an8}<i>I still haven't received
the rent for this month.</i>

95
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,106
<i>If you're tight on money,
I can collect it later.</i>

96
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,776
Ah, no, I'll transfer it in a bit.

97
00:05:54,859 --> 00:05:56,486
<i>I see. Appreciate it.</i>

98
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,863
<i>Take care.</i>

99
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:00,865
Okay, thank you.

100
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:06,829
<i>I don't know if the phenomenon on me
is a second awakening.</i>

101
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:11,375
<i>But now I can kill goblins in an instant.</i>

102
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,294
<i>I should be able to earn the rent easily.</i>

103
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,173
That being said,

104
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,717
it's not so easy to find work.

105
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,846
I need to enter higher-level gates
to make money.

106
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,972
However,

107
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:28,643
an E-rank hunter like me
has no chance of getting in.

108
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,521
Should I go for a re-evaluation?

109
00:06:31,604 --> 00:06:34,565
If my hunter rank is higher,
I could enter the high-level gates.

110
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:37,193
The more attention I get,
the more money I might make.

111
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:39,904
<i>But it would attract too much attention.</i>

112
00:06:40,404 --> 00:06:42,240
<i>People with second awakening are rare.</i>

113
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,203
<i>Not to mention hunters who grow stronger
as their level increases.</i>

114
00:06:48,287 --> 00:06:51,082
<i>That would attract a lot
of unnecessary attention.</i>

115
00:06:51,165 --> 00:06:53,126
<i>The media are annoying.</i>

116
00:06:53,209 --> 00:06:55,253
<i>I might even become a target.</i>

117
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:57,296
<i>Better not.</i>

118
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,966
<i>At least I should be able
to protect myself first.</i>

119
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:01,092
<i>Also,</i>

120
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,511
<i>it's better to keep it down
before I know what this power is.</i>

121
00:07:16,482 --> 00:07:17,400
Confirm.

122
00:07:19,318 --> 00:07:20,236
Hello there.

123
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:24,782
I'm Hwang Dongsuk.

124
00:07:24,866 --> 00:07:26,075
I'm Sung Jinwoo.

125
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,827
-An E-rank, right?
-Yes.

126
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,787
Ah, I know him.

127
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:31,539
He's super famous.

128
00:07:32,123 --> 00:07:35,793
I remember his nickname is
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

129
00:07:36,544 --> 00:07:38,754
-What the heck?
-Hey, stop this.

130
00:07:38,838 --> 00:07:41,048
Sorry, my members are rude.

131
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:43,885
No, it's true that I am an E-rank hunter.

132
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:45,428
Can I join?

133
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:47,054
No problem.

134
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:49,974
I just need you to make up the numbers.

135
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:53,436
I said it over the phone,
but let me confirm it again.

136
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,648
At least eight people are required
to enter this C-rank dungeon.

137
00:07:57,732 --> 00:08:00,443
And half of them must be C-rank.

138
00:08:00,526 --> 00:08:04,405
You're not counted as combat power,
so you will not share the spoils.

139
00:08:05,072 --> 00:08:08,409
However, we will pay your commission fee
of 2 million in cash.

140
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,831
<i>Four C-rank hunters
and two D-rank or lower ones?</i>

141
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:15,666
I understand.

142
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,460
What should I do?

143
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:19,295
You'll carry the luggage.

144
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:22,715
Inside are bento meals
as well as spare clothes and equipment.

145
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:24,258
There's also a first aid kit.

146
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:27,220
You're not bringing a healer in?

147
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:31,182
It's difficult for private teams
like us to recruit healers.

148
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:32,558
You should know that.

149
00:08:32,642 --> 00:08:35,520
We have always managed like this.

150
00:08:35,603 --> 00:08:36,938
Right.

151
00:08:37,021 --> 00:08:39,941
<i>A team with only tankers and fighters?</i>

152
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:41,651
<i>That's reckless.</i>

153
00:08:42,276 --> 00:08:45,071
<i>And the fact that there's no healer
is quite concerning.</i>

154
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:47,949
Well then, please sign the contract.

155
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:54,330
<i>"The other party won't be held accountable
for any incidents in the dungeon."</i>

156
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:55,414
Done.

157
00:08:55,498 --> 00:08:56,332
Thank you.

158
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:01,712
We're the same.

159
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:05,299
My name is Yoo Jinho,
21 years old, a D-rank hunter.

160
00:09:05,383 --> 00:09:07,635
I was also brought in to make up numbers.

161
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:08,761
Okay.

162
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:10,763
<i>D-rank with such gears?</i>

163
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:12,640
<i>His family must be rich.</i>

164
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:15,851
Is this your first time
in a C-rank dungeon?

165
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:18,854
Don't worry. I will protect you.

166
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:24,860
Let's go then.

167
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:27,029
Aren't the bags heavy?

168
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:28,030
Are you okay?

169
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:30,366
Yes, I'm fine.

170
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,953
I'm younger than you.
You don't have to speak so formally.

171
00:09:35,454 --> 00:09:36,789
All right.

172
00:09:36,872 --> 00:09:37,873
Have you heard?

173
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:40,293
The president who took on this project

174
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:43,879
escaped abroad
with 900 billion funds two months ago.

175
00:09:43,963 --> 00:09:46,757
The employees and investors
are all complaining.

176
00:09:46,841 --> 00:09:47,925
I see.

177
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,220
Ah… Did I talk too much again?

178
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:54,473
I'm not used to paying attention
to people's reactions.

179
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,436
This is it.

180
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,856
Wow, what a large entrance.

181
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:04,400
Such size is really rare.

182
00:10:05,276 --> 00:10:08,279
Dongsuk, is this really a C-rank gate?

183
00:10:08,362 --> 00:10:09,655
Isn't it too big?

184
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:14,118
The investigators confirmed twice
before giving a C-rank evaluation.

185
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,369
Then it must be C-rank.

186
00:10:15,453 --> 00:10:17,330
This gate is huge.

187
00:10:17,413 --> 00:10:19,081
Is it okay to enter?

188
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,500
The size of the gate isn't very important.

189
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:24,337
What matters is the flux
of magic power emanating from the inside.

190
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:28,758
The Association will measure
that value and classify it.

191
00:10:28,841 --> 00:10:33,179
Normally, B-rank and above dungeons
are handled by large guilds.

192
00:10:33,262 --> 00:10:35,556
Those below C-rank aren't as dangerous.

193
00:10:36,223 --> 00:10:38,434
You know a lot about this, Jinwoo.

194
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:40,519
I have been a hunter for some time.

195
00:10:41,604 --> 00:10:44,732
<i>But still, this is my first time
in a C-rank dungeon.</i>

196
00:10:45,316 --> 00:10:47,234
{\an8}Please follow me.

197
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:48,527
Yes.

198
00:10:48,611 --> 00:10:50,488
Jinwoo, let's go.

199
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:53,366
Hmm… got it.

200
00:10:57,828 --> 00:10:59,955
Kyuhwan, some light.

201
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,040
Yes.

202
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,837
What's going on here?

203
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:08,339
Not a single magic beast.

204
00:11:08,422 --> 00:11:10,174
And it's pitch black.

205
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:13,094
There are luminescent stones
in dungeons normally.

206
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:14,845
<i>A pitch-black dungeon</i>

207
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:17,681
<i>reminds me of the Cartenon Temple.</i>

208
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:19,725
Jinwoo,

209
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,769
what are luminescent stones?

210
00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:22,978
Well,

211
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:27,900
luminescent stones are glowing rocks
that are common in cave-like dungeons.

212
00:11:28,526 --> 00:11:31,070
They are usually found
on the walls or the floor,

213
00:11:31,153 --> 00:11:33,364
emitting a faint light to illuminate
the insides of the cave.

214
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:37,701
So, the magic gems
obtained from magic beasts,

215
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:40,621
the mana crystals collected in dungeons,

216
00:11:40,704 --> 00:11:44,208
and the luminescent stones
that light up the caves.

217
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:46,335
{\an8}They are quite confusing.

218
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,920
{\an8}You will get used to it soon.

219
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:53,968
By the way, there's nothing here.

220
00:11:54,635 --> 00:11:55,594
Jinwoo.

221
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:57,680
Can there be a dungeon
without magic beasts?

222
00:12:00,891 --> 00:12:02,560
This sound…

223
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:05,771
There are magic beasts here.
They just haven't shown up.

224
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:06,730
{\an8}Get ready!

225
00:12:06,814 --> 00:12:07,690
-Yes!
-Yes!

226
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,526
<i>Moving as a group in the dark,</i>

227
00:12:10,609 --> 00:12:12,778
<i>and swarming towards any light source.</i>

228
00:12:13,737 --> 00:12:15,406
Insect-type magic beasts!

229
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:17,992
-Insects.
-Damn it. Insects, of all things.

230
00:12:18,075 --> 00:12:19,994
Dongsuk, do you see anything?

231
00:12:20,077 --> 00:12:21,328
No, I can't see a thing.

232
00:12:21,412 --> 00:12:23,247
Is this an ant nest?

233
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,790
Then we're in trouble.

234
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,375
{\an8}The sounds are getting closer.

235
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:27,835
Where will they emerge from?

236
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:29,295
There are too many holes here.

237
00:12:30,379 --> 00:12:31,464
Above!

238
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:36,802
{\an8}Kyuhwan!

239
00:12:39,054 --> 00:12:41,265
-I'll draw their attention.
-Yes!

240
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:44,018
Jinwoo, please don't leave my side.

241
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,939
Look over here, bugs!

242
00:12:51,942 --> 00:12:54,069
Amazing, all the bugs
are heading towards Hwang.

243
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:55,738
<i>It's a taunting skill.</i>

244
00:12:55,821 --> 00:12:57,364
<i>C-rank hunters are indeed better.</i>

245
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,202
Jinsuk, eleven o'clock direction.

246
00:13:01,285 --> 00:13:02,119
Understood.

247
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,830
-I'll also…
-Step back.

248
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:05,789
Start the countdown.

249
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:10,878
Five, four, three, two, one.

250
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:11,962
{\an8}Zero!

251
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:13,297
This is my trump card.

252
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,965
Take this!

253
00:13:16,467 --> 00:13:18,469
Good, take them down.

254
00:13:18,552 --> 00:13:19,887
I've been waiting.

255
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,639
{\an8}<i>Good teamwork.</i>

256
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:24,850
{\an8}<i>They must've been
working together for long.</i>

257
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:28,729
<i>But maybe because
they don't have a healer,</i>

258
00:13:28,812 --> 00:13:29,772
<i>the way they fight is rough.</i>

259
00:13:31,273 --> 00:13:32,274
<i>As for Jinho…</i>

260
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,736
<i>His equipment compensates
for the lack of strength.</i>

261
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:40,366
<i>Everyone is doing well,</i>

262
00:13:42,117 --> 00:13:42,952
<i>but I feel…</i>

263
00:13:47,122 --> 00:13:48,249
<i>a bit unsettled.</i>

264
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,125
All right.

265
00:13:50,626 --> 00:13:51,835
This should be the last one.

266
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,753
Jinsuk.

267
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,298
Yes, no more enemies.

268
00:13:56,382 --> 00:13:57,216
All taken care of.

269
00:13:57,716 --> 00:13:59,093
Good, it's over.

270
00:13:59,176 --> 00:14:01,887
Take all the magic gems
and split them into seven parts.

271
00:14:01,971 --> 00:14:03,389
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

272
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:06,225
I love this moment the most.

273
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:07,351
Me too.

274
00:14:07,935 --> 00:14:10,062
Thanks for your help.

275
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:12,481
It would have been dangerous
if we had discovered them later.

276
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:13,482
It's okay.

277
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:16,026
How did you know they were above?

278
00:14:17,152 --> 00:14:17,987
{\an8}It's intuition.

279
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:21,115
Your intuition is surely sharp.

280
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:22,408
Dongsuk.

281
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,285
Come take a look at this.

282
00:14:24,368 --> 00:14:25,661
Look at their wounds.

283
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:27,997
These aren't sword wounds.

284
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,208
No, they don't look like burns
caused by magic either.

285
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:36,171
Many of them were
bitten to death like this.

286
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:39,091
Did the magic beasts fight
each other over territory?

287
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:43,637
So there must be a stronger
magic beast around here.

288
00:14:44,513 --> 00:14:45,806
<i>Is that so?</i>

289
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,642
<i>A high-rank beast
that preys on these insects.</i>

290
00:14:50,352 --> 00:14:53,689
Did you see the way
I slayed the magic beasts?

291
00:14:54,273 --> 00:14:55,107
Yeah.

292
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:56,942
Jinho.

293
00:14:57,026 --> 00:14:59,361
Your sword and shield
are expensive, right?

294
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:00,988
Eh? Yeah.

295
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:02,448
This is my first mission,

296
00:15:02,531 --> 00:15:04,491
so my father bought me high-quality gear.

297
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:06,327
I see.

298
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,953
I don't know for sure yet,

299
00:15:08,621 --> 00:15:09,997
but it's better to be cautious.

300
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:22,468
What was that sound? An explosion?

301
00:15:22,551 --> 00:15:24,762
Stay calm, it happens all the time here.

302
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:26,138
Look.

303
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:29,642
The guild master is in training.

304
00:15:35,272 --> 00:15:36,607
{\an8}Amazing.

305
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,609
{\an8}He pierced through
that huge boulder in one strike.

306
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,238
This isn't even a warm-up.

307
00:15:44,073 --> 00:15:46,408
Hey, clean this up.

308
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:50,996
We've been walking for quite a while.

309
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:54,833
-The size of the dungeon--
-Is unrelated to its level, right?

310
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:57,461
It's related to the flux of magic power.

311
00:15:57,544 --> 00:16:01,465
Although the dungeon is big,
it's quite empty, right?

312
00:16:01,548 --> 00:16:02,383
Yes.

313
00:16:02,883 --> 00:16:06,512
But transporting luggage becomes
quite laborious in such a big dungeon.

314
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:08,764
Jinwoo, can you still manage?

315
00:16:08,847 --> 00:16:10,975
It's not that heavy.

316
00:16:11,058 --> 00:16:15,104
It's good to earn money
without having to fight.

317
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:18,190
<i>A good deal.</i>

318
00:16:18,273 --> 00:16:19,191
<i>No.</i>

319
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:20,317
<i>Too good, actually.</i>

320
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:23,028
<i>I have a feeling there's something fishy.</i>

321
00:16:25,072 --> 00:16:28,367
<i>A battle-hardened team
yet without a healer.</i>

322
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:31,245
{\an8}<i>And they even needed
to make up the number.</i>

323
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:33,414
These magic beasts are also half-dead.

324
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:36,166
Nice.

325
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:39,545
It really is strange.

326
00:16:39,628 --> 00:16:43,424
We haven't encountered a single
uninjured magic beast during the walk.

327
00:16:43,507 --> 00:16:46,677
All we've seen are either corpses
or those barely alive.

328
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,679
The boss should be somewhere.

329
00:16:48,762 --> 00:16:50,889
If there's no boss, the gate won't open.

330
00:16:51,849 --> 00:16:53,058
Wait.

331
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,852
Kyuhwan, light it up.

332
00:16:54,935 --> 00:16:55,769
Okay.

333
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:03,152
I think the boss room should be ahead.

334
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:04,069
Let's go.

335
00:17:16,415 --> 00:17:17,791
This is…

336
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,751
Unbelievable.

337
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:20,627
Mana crystals!

338
00:17:20,711 --> 00:17:22,880
There's quite a lot.

339
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:25,007
They're not as valuable as the magic gems,

340
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,133
but the amount…

341
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:28,761
They are worth about a billion.

342
00:17:29,261 --> 00:17:30,262
Dongsuk.

343
00:17:30,345 --> 00:17:33,015
Your brother will be green with envy.

344
00:17:33,098 --> 00:17:34,099
Hey.

345
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:36,935
Don't bring up his brother.

346
00:17:37,895 --> 00:17:40,230
<i>Dongsoo, I've told you.</i>

347
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,650
<i>You're not always right.</i>

348
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:47,196
<i>I'm no longer the guy
who always listens to his younger brother.</i>

349
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:51,909
<i>I will use these as capital
to expand my team.</i>

350
00:17:52,409 --> 00:17:53,577
We're so lucky.

351
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,205
If we split them between seven,
everyone will get over 100 million.

352
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:57,664
How are we going to move these out?

353
00:17:57,748 --> 00:17:58,665
Jinwoo.

354
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:00,876
Please let me see your contract.

355
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,836
I know the law very well.

356
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,754
Okay.

357
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:06,965
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

358
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:10,719
This is the contract
you signed with Jinwoo.

359
00:18:10,803 --> 00:18:13,305
It only mentions
the ownership of the spoils.

360
00:18:13,388 --> 00:18:17,309
But mana crystals don't count as spoils.

361
00:18:17,392 --> 00:18:20,896
So it should be divided
into eight parts, right?

362
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:22,272
Of course.

363
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:23,732
We must do it fairly.

364
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:25,234
I'm clear on that.

365
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:26,777
However,

366
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,279
we need to deal with that guy first.

367
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:31,490
The dungeon boss.

368
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:32,950
I think you understand this.

369
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:35,202
After defeating the boss,
the gate will close.

370
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:39,957
So we must move all the mana crystals out
before defeating that spider.

371
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:43,377
Luckily, it's sleeping.

372
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,963
Now might be a great opportunity to mine.

373
00:18:46,588 --> 00:18:48,048
Lee Chul-jin, where are our tools?

374
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:52,928
I didn't know there'd be so many.

375
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:56,056
I left the tools in the car.

376
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,976
Haven't I always told you
to keep the tools with you?

377
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:00,811
I'm really sorry.

378
00:19:00,894 --> 00:19:02,271
Sorry.

379
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:04,773
Can you two stay here?

380
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:06,275
We need to get the tools.

381
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:10,112
Just the two of us in the boss room?

382
00:19:10,195 --> 00:19:11,655
Don't worry.

383
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:14,491
It should be full and sound asleep.

384
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:17,619
It should be fine for now
as long as you don't provoke it.

385
00:19:17,703 --> 00:19:18,662
But…

386
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:21,039
Yoo, it's your first mission, right?

387
00:19:21,582 --> 00:19:25,085
Mr. Sung, this is also your first time
in a C-rank dungeon, isn't it?

388
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:26,962
Just trust me, guys.

389
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:28,755
Okay?

390
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:31,508
I need to tell my members something.

391
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,594
I'll come back after a smoke.

392
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:35,179
<i>According to the rules,</i>

393
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:38,891
<i>at least eight people are needed
to conquer a C-rank dungeon.</i>

394
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:42,936
<i>Excluding Jinho and me,
this team originally had six people.</i>

395
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,480
<i>We have always managed like this.</i>

396
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:48,317
{\an8}<i>He said "always," which means</i>

397
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,777
{\an8}<i>they often conquer C-rank dungeons.</i>

398
00:19:51,862 --> 00:19:55,490
<i>They should have regulars
to make up the numbers.</i>

399
00:19:56,491 --> 00:19:57,910
Kyuhwan.

400
00:19:57,993 --> 00:20:00,871
Block the entrance to the boss room.

401
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,711
The entrance is… What is this?

402
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:11,632
Did they betray us?

403
00:20:11,715 --> 00:20:14,092
{\an8}<i>As expected. They are…</i>

404
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,679
Sometimes you just come
across such scumbags.

405
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,267
{\an8}This work is inherently dangerous,
and accidents are par for the course.

406
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:27,773
{\an8}But even if an accident happens,
it won't be made public.

407
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:30,067
{\an8}The same goes for crimes.

408
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:33,487
There are no surveillance cameras
in the dungeons.

409
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,573
If everyone is dead,
there's no evidence left.

410
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:40,661
{\an8}They use the weak
as bait to lure the enemy

411
00:20:40,744 --> 00:20:42,204
{\an8}or abandon them in there.

412
00:20:42,746 --> 00:20:43,789
{\an8}In simple terms,

413
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:45,999
{\an8}it's like a gecko dropping
its tail to survive.

414
00:20:47,209 --> 00:20:51,338
They plan to kill us
over a few mana crystals.

415
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:57,636
I talked too much about the contract.

416
00:20:58,804 --> 00:20:59,846
<i>No.</i>

417
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,098
<i>Either way,</i>

418
00:21:02,224 --> 00:21:05,352
<i>they would have killed us immediately
if we acted rashly.</i>

419
00:21:06,395 --> 00:21:07,604
<i>More importantly…</i>

420
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,068
Jinwoo, please step back.

421
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:14,569
I will figure out a way.

422
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:17,864
<i>We should be able to get out from there.</i>

423
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:19,533
<i>This must be their plan.</i>

424
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,374
<i>A C-rank boss.</i>

425
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,876
<i>And an E-rank hunter.</i>

426
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:33,046
<i>The difference in strength is too great.</i>

427
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:39,886
<i>But…</i>

428
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:42,055
<i>Is it?</i>

429
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:45,767
<i>I take back what I said.</i>

430
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:47,477
Jinho, stay put.

431
00:21:48,228 --> 00:21:49,563
I'll handle this guy.

432
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,898
What did you just say?

433
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:00,365
I'll take it down.
