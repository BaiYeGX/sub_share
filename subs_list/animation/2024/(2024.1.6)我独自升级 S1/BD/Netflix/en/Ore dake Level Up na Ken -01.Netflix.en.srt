1
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:13,143
Captain, we should support them too.

2
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,437
{\an8}You know it's futile, don't you?

3
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:20,400
{\an8}Our conventional weapons
can't harm those things.

4
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:26,489
{\an8}We can only leave it to those hunters.

5
00:00:43,256 --> 00:00:44,716
{\an8}Engage individually!

6
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:47,802
{\an8}If this place is breached,
our lines will collapse!

7
00:00:49,304 --> 00:00:50,138
Don't retreat!

8
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:05,445
{\an8}No. I can't.

9
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:08,156
{\an8}This isn't an opponent we can handle.

10
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:10,700
{\an8}<i>Damn it.</i>

11
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:13,495
{\an8}<i>I'm about to lose consciousness…</i>

12
00:01:24,088 --> 00:01:25,465
<i>Is it healing magic?</i>

13
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:29,093
<i>Incredible.</i>

14
00:01:29,177 --> 00:01:30,512
<i>My wound healed in an instant.</i>

15
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:33,139
Look… Look out!

16
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:34,599
Byung-gu, get down!

17
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:37,977
Yoonho!

18
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:38,895
Leave it to me.

19
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,617
S-rank hunters.

20
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,619
S-rank hunters are here.

21
00:01:54,702 --> 00:01:57,080
You're too far ahead, Byung-gu.

22
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:58,456
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,333
I wanted to save more people.

24
00:02:00,416 --> 00:02:04,295
Moreover, I believe
that you two will protect me.

25
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:15,431
It doesn't look like the boss.

26
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:17,934
It must be the leader of these monsters.

27
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:20,520
Byung-gu, take care of the wounded.

28
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,022
Leave it to me, Yoonho.

29
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:25,150
Let's go, Eunseok!

30
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,067
Understood.

31
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,548
Take this!

32
00:02:56,764 --> 00:02:58,016
You brute.

33
00:02:58,099 --> 00:02:58,933
What?

34
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:04,355
It doesn't seem to be the leader either.

35
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,316
{\an8}Interesting.

36
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:22,165
Looks like they made it in time.

37
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,628
Well then,

38
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:28,212
let's begin.

39
00:03:29,172 --> 00:03:31,132
Mr. Choi, we're ready.

40
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,050
All right.

41
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,815
Let's attack now!

42
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:55,823
{\an8}<i>More than a decade ago,</i>

43
00:03:55,907 --> 00:03:58,243
{\an8}<i>gates that could connect
to a different dimension</i>

44
00:03:58,326 --> 00:04:00,787
{\an8}<i>suddenly appeared in the world.</i>

45
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:07,001
{\an8}<i>Various monsters and magic beasts
reside within the gates.</i>

46
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:09,337
{\an8}<i>Conventional weapons can't fight them.</i>

47
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,049
{\an8}<i>Only those with awakened
special abilities are able to fight them.</i>

48
00:04:13,633 --> 00:04:15,134
{\an8}<i>They are called hunters.</i>

49
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:18,888
{\an8}<i>Based on their magical powers,</i>

50
00:04:18,972 --> 00:04:25,979
{\an8}<i>hunters are classified into
S, A, B, C, D, and E ranks.</i>

51
00:04:27,522 --> 00:04:32,068
{\an8}<i>However, once awakened,
no matter how hard they try,</i>

52
00:04:33,027 --> 00:04:35,863
{\an8}<i>their abilities will
no longer be developed.</i>

53
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:01,556
Good luck with today's raid mission.

54
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:02,557
Thank you.

55
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:05,435
Hey, Kim.

56
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:07,729
-Long time no see.
-What?

57
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:10,189
Park? What brings you here?

58
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:13,192
I thought you quit being a hunter.

59
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:16,654
My wife is pregnant with our second child.

60
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:18,072
I see.

61
00:05:18,156 --> 00:05:21,117
We can make a lot of money
if the raid mission is successful.

62
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,536
But I'm very worried.

63
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:26,456
I don't know if I can keep up
with you all after my hiatus.

64
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:28,333
I'm not very strong as well.

65
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,752
Is that Sung?

66
00:05:30,835 --> 00:05:32,712
Good morning, Sung.

67
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:34,630
It must be tough in cold weather.

68
00:05:36,883 --> 00:05:38,509
Nice to see you today.

69
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:40,470
Hey, Sung.

70
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,638
Have you been eating properly?

71
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,683
Yes. I have been eating properly.

72
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:48,644
Who is he? Is he strong?

73
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:50,480
Why is everyone greeting him?

74
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:52,982
It's actually the opposite.

75
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:55,401
He joined us after you left.

76
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:59,947
{\an8}That kid has a nickname,
The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind.

77
00:06:00,031 --> 00:06:02,450
{\an8}The weakest? Not the strongest?

78
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:03,367
{\an8}The weakest.

79
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:06,245
{\an8}He was even injured
in an E-rank dungeon and hospitalized.

80
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:09,373
He's probably the weakest hunter.

81
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:11,751
Really? He's that weak?

82
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:16,047
So, calling that kid here
means this mission is easy.

83
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,590
I see.

84
00:06:17,673 --> 00:06:18,966
Don't let him hear this.

85
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,344
Let's end this topic.

86
00:06:22,053 --> 00:06:24,222
<i>I heard everything.</i>

87
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:25,765
<i>But,</i>

88
00:06:25,848 --> 00:06:28,893
<i>what he said is true. I can't deny it.</i>

89
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:31,395
Jinwoo, why are you injured again?

90
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:33,397
Joohee.

91
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:35,149
We're going on a mission together again.

92
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:38,861
More importantly,
what happened to your face?

93
00:06:38,945 --> 00:06:41,697
Well… Just the usual.

94
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:45,284
Be more careful.

95
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:48,788
I heard you ended up in the hospital.

96
00:06:48,871 --> 00:06:51,249
I was the only one that got injured
in the E-rank dungeon.

97
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:53,543
There was no healer in your team?

98
00:06:54,127 --> 00:06:58,756
The others are all high-ranked hunters,
so they didn't need a healer.

99
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,341
How could they?

100
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:02,760
There could be other people who need one.

101
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:05,263
It's okay. I'm just too weak.

102
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:08,182
You must know this too.

103
00:07:08,683 --> 00:07:10,059
I'm already used to it.

104
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:14,230
Looks like we're about to go in.

105
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:15,189
Let's go.

106
00:07:16,732 --> 00:07:20,778
I'll be the captain of this raid mission.

107
00:07:20,862 --> 00:07:21,863
My name is Song Chiyul.

108
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:23,990
Nice to meet you all.

109
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:25,867
Of course.

110
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,995
You are the highest-ranked
hunter among us.

111
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:30,705
I'm relieved to have you lead the team.

112
00:07:31,372 --> 00:07:33,499
Nice to meet you, Mr. Song.

113
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,417
All right.

114
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:37,003
Is everyone ready?

115
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:37,920
Let's go in.

116
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,427
Sung.

117
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:48,764
Stick close to us and don't get hurt.

118
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:50,975
Okay.

119
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:52,977
Let's do our job well.

120
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:58,774
<i>A small knife with little magic power.</i>

121
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:02,945
<i>With my income,
I can only afford this knife.</i>

122
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:04,864
<i>But it's better than nothing.</i>

123
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:09,994
I must perform well today.

124
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:21,589
Thank you for your hard work,
President Go.

125
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:24,342
How was your meeting with the government?

126
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:27,762
They always say the same thing.

127
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:29,764
They want us to avoid Dungeon Break.

128
00:08:29,847 --> 00:08:33,976
And they demand us to stably supply
the goods acquired from the dungeon.

129
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:38,898
There's nothing wrong with their requests.

130
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:44,237
We make a living by reselling goods
acquired from the dungeon.

131
00:08:49,242 --> 00:08:52,537
The crystals obtained
from slain magic beasts

132
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,539
are known as the magic gems.

133
00:08:54,622 --> 00:08:55,748
They can be sold for money.

134
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:03,297
I did it.

135
00:09:03,881 --> 00:09:05,466
I finally got the first…

136
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,425
Jinwoo!

137
00:09:21,023 --> 00:09:22,316
Jinwoo!

138
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,651
Joohee, back off.

139
00:09:23,734 --> 00:09:24,569
Take this!

140
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:30,449
I'll defeat the next magic beast.

141
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,410
Joohee, you go heal Sung.

142
00:09:33,244 --> 00:09:34,120
Okay!

143
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,498
It's fine.

144
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:39,750
I'll definitely heal you.

145
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,438
The magic gems obtained
from high-rank magic beasts

146
00:10:00,521 --> 00:10:06,277
can be made into more powerful weapons
to defeat stronger magic beasts.

147
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:11,324
Although the mana crystals harvested
from the dungeon can also be weapons,

148
00:10:11,407 --> 00:10:13,534
their effects are not as good
as those of magic gems.

149
00:10:14,035 --> 00:10:16,746
But the requirement of the government…

150
00:10:17,622 --> 00:10:20,082
{\an8}They want to use them
as a new type of energy.

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,085
It is safer than nuclear power,

152
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,297
and more efficient than hydropower,
wind power, and geothermal power.

153
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,050
It causes less air pollution
than thermal power.

154
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:32,219
{\an8}So, it's the ideal green energy.

155
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,181
{\an8}The government is encouraging
power generation

156
00:10:35,264 --> 00:10:37,475
{\an8}using magic gems and mana crystals.

157
00:10:37,558 --> 00:10:40,436
{\an8}It can only be realized through
rare resources acquired by hunters.

158
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:44,690
{\an8}Therefore, the hunters are
particularly important.

159
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:53,282
-Great!
-We did it!

160
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:54,992
We defeated the dungeon boss.

161
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:56,994
-Nice!
-Mr. Song really is amazing.

162
00:10:57,078 --> 00:10:58,579
-We succeeded.
-Yeah!

163
00:10:59,664 --> 00:11:00,665
{\an8}Jinwoo.

164
00:11:00,748 --> 00:11:03,834
{\an8}Are you working as a hunter out of pique?

165
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,589
Something will happen to you someday.

166
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:12,009
Not only your stomach, your whole body
has sustained significant injury.

167
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:12,927
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,346
I don't want an apology.

169
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:17,139
I'm worried about you.

170
00:11:22,853 --> 00:11:25,981
Everyone, did you get your spoils?

171
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:28,567
We got most of them.

172
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:30,986
{\an8}There aren't many mana crystal veins here.

173
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:34,031
We can't make much money.

174
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:36,700
<i>Is it over?</i>

175
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:41,163
<i>I only got this E-rank magic gem.</i>

176
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:44,875
<i>It's not worth risking my life for this.</i>

177
00:11:46,669 --> 00:11:48,212
Hey!

178
00:11:48,295 --> 00:11:49,964
Everyone, come over here!

179
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:51,757
Is it a cave?

180
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:52,967
Or a tunnel?

181
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,428
It seems that the cave is quite deep.

182
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,847
{\an8}A double dungeon?

183
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,849
{\an8}I've heard of it.

184
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:03,894
{\an8}After all, we have defeated the boss,
but the dungeon is not closing.

185
00:12:03,978 --> 00:12:06,272
{\an8}Right, I find it odd too.

186
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:07,773
So, it means…

187
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:08,899
Right.

188
00:12:08,983 --> 00:12:11,235
There are more prey
deep within this cave.

189
00:12:11,318 --> 00:12:13,195
Listen to me.

190
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:16,115
{\an8}Usually, in such a situation,

191
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:19,660
{\an8}we should report to Hunters Association
and follow instructions.

192
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:21,704
Wait a minute, Song.

193
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:25,166
Doesn't that mean giving up prey
to the hunters coming after us?

194
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:29,170
It's just a D-rank dungeon. It's okay.

195
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:31,255
His wife is pregnant
with their second child,

196
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:33,132
and there are so few mana crystals here.

197
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:36,427
It should be okay to give some slack,

198
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,761
right?

199
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:39,638
I can understand how you feel.

200
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:41,974
But it's also true that
there are unknown dangers.

201
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,726
Let's vote on it.

202
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:45,102
I don't want to go.

203
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:46,145
Let's go.

204
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:47,438
I object.

205
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:48,355
Object.

206
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,483
-Let's go check it out.
-I feel the same.

207
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,276
-Right.
-We should go back.

208
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:55,029
-I'm going.
-Of course, I will go.

209
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:57,990
Sorry… I don't want to go.

210
00:12:59,241 --> 00:13:01,744
It's six votes in favor
and six votes against it.

211
00:13:02,286 --> 00:13:04,997
Only Sung hasn't voted. What do you think?

212
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,457
I…

213
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:12,087
<i>I understand how dangerous
a D-rank dungeon is for me.</i>

214
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,131
<i>But…</i>

215
00:13:14,215 --> 00:13:16,008
<i>With my father missing,</i>

216
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,093
<i>I'm the only one
in the family who can earn money.</i>

217
00:13:19,094 --> 00:13:20,304
<i>My mother has medical expenses.</i>

218
00:13:20,387 --> 00:13:22,598
<i>My sister has to go to college.</i>

219
00:13:23,807 --> 00:13:26,060
<i>So, I need money.</i>

220
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:28,562
I'm going.

221
00:13:35,444 --> 00:13:38,614
Then please place your hand
on the black crystal.

222
00:13:45,704 --> 00:13:47,540
Next one, please.

223
00:13:51,252 --> 00:13:52,920
Are you a C-rank hunter?

224
00:13:53,003 --> 00:13:54,505
Then please join our association.

225
00:13:54,588 --> 00:13:57,716
These are the contract terms
of our association.

226
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,718
Here are descriptions of work conditions.

227
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:08,143
Right, one B-rank hunter and two C-rank
hunters have agreed to sign with us.

228
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:11,105
Everything is going smoothly, Mr. Choi.

229
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:12,606
<i>Very good.</i>

230
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,692
Regardless of gender or age,

231
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:17,319
recruit anyone with talent.

232
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:23,284
But I don't think any talent is stronger
than Cha Hae-In of our association.

233
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:26,579
Someone catch them!

234
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,414
Move…

235
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:35,045
Move! Do you want to get hit?

236
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:58,944
-I…
-Here it is.

237
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,905
Thank you!

238
00:15:00,988 --> 00:15:02,364
-It's Cha Hae-In!
-Thank you!

239
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:03,407
Cha Hae-In!

240
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,408
That S-rank hunter?

241
00:15:04,491 --> 00:15:06,368
-Awesome!
-It's her!

242
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:07,536
So cute.

243
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,913
-I'm your fan.
-I…

244
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:10,331
-Can you shake my hand?
-I…

245
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:17,588
Amazing!

246
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:19,465
That's an S-rank hunter's ability.

247
00:15:22,384 --> 00:15:24,803
How long have we been walking
after entering the cave?

248
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:26,680
About 40 minutes.

249
00:15:26,764 --> 00:15:29,516
The gate will close in an hour
after the boss is defeated.

250
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,018
So we have 20 minutes.

251
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:33,938
I'm sorry.

252
00:15:34,021 --> 00:15:35,522
Why are you apologizing?

253
00:15:35,606 --> 00:15:39,568
My vote forced you to come in too.

254
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:41,570
I'm okay.

255
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:42,905
Don't worry.

256
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:45,616
Are you really okay?

257
00:15:46,283 --> 00:15:47,368
How could I possibly

258
00:15:47,451 --> 00:15:49,203
be okay?!

259
00:15:49,286 --> 00:15:51,330
Did you forget?

260
00:15:51,413 --> 00:15:55,417
Jinwoo, if you had been stabbed
a little higher, you would have died.

261
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:58,671
And I barely managed
to heal your hands and feet.

262
00:15:58,754 --> 00:16:00,756
Are you crazy?

263
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,549
Are you out of your mind?

264
00:16:02,633 --> 00:16:03,717
Tell me.

265
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:05,636
I'm sorry.

266
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,221
<i>That's right.</i>

267
00:16:07,304 --> 00:16:11,100
<i>Thanks to the B-rank healer Joohee,
I was able to survive every time.</i>

268
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:13,727
Are you truly reflecting?

269
00:16:13,811 --> 00:16:14,645
Yes.

270
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,567
Well, you can apologize
by treating me to a meal next time.

271
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:21,527
What?

272
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,447
What? You don't like eating with me?

273
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:27,533
No… How could that be?

274
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:28,575
We've arrived.

275
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,994
It's the boss room.

276
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:35,749
It's rare to see rooms
with doors like this.

277
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,418
It feels a bit weird.

278
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:38,669
Right.

279
00:16:38,752 --> 00:16:39,920
I'm going in.

280
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,839
I can't go back empty-handed.

281
00:16:41,922 --> 00:16:43,507
That's right. I'm going too.

282
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:46,593
We shall advance and retreat together.

283
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:49,304
Is that right, Captain Song?

284
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:51,724
Right.

285
00:16:55,853 --> 00:16:57,980
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

286
00:16:58,063 --> 00:17:01,525
<i>I'm Go Gunhee, the president
of the Hunters Association.</i>

287
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:03,152
<i>I suppose some among you</i>

288
00:17:03,235 --> 00:17:08,407
<i>will become hunters in the future,
while others will not.</i>

289
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,160
<i>The gates have existed
for more than ten years.</i>

290
00:17:11,243 --> 00:17:14,121
<i>There are still many mysteries
unsolved in the dungeons.</i>

291
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:16,373
<i>Being a hunter is
a life-threatening profession.</i>

292
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:18,500
<i>Even if you've gotten
used to raid missions,</i>

293
00:17:18,584 --> 00:17:20,502
<i>you can't let your guard down.</i>

294
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:23,297
<i>Don't be arrogant and contemptuous.</i>

295
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,340
<i>If you want to survive,
there's only one key point.</i>

296
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:27,801
<i>That is to be more cautious.</i>

297
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:37,269
The fire started.

298
00:17:38,062 --> 00:17:39,271
Nice atmosphere.

299
00:17:39,354 --> 00:17:41,482
This is my first time
visiting this kind of dungeon.

300
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:52,659
What's going on with these statues?

301
00:17:52,743 --> 00:17:54,244
They seem to be century-old ones.

302
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:56,497
Some of them are holding
musical instruments.

303
00:18:02,753 --> 00:18:04,463
Only this statue is particularly large.

304
00:18:05,464 --> 00:18:06,882
It is indeed very large.

305
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:07,883
What is this?

306
00:18:07,966 --> 00:18:09,343
It feels quite eerie.

307
00:18:09,968 --> 00:18:12,429
Speaking of which,
where is the magic beast?

308
00:18:12,513 --> 00:18:13,388
That's right.

309
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,057
There's not a single one.

310
00:18:16,892 --> 00:18:19,061
What is this? A magic circle?

311
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,688
Mr. Song, something is written here!

312
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:24,066
Is this an ancient language?

313
00:18:24,149 --> 00:18:25,150
Let me see.

314
00:18:25,943 --> 00:18:28,570
"The Commandments of the Cartenon Temple."

315
00:18:28,654 --> 00:18:31,573
"First, worship the God."

316
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:34,535
-"Second, praise the God."
-Jinwoo…

317
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:37,246
"Third, believe in God…"

318
00:18:37,329 --> 00:18:41,667
The eyes of that large statue just moved.

319
00:18:42,334 --> 00:18:44,336
It was looking at us.

320
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:45,712
What?

321
00:18:45,796 --> 00:18:49,299
-"Those who do not obey…
-How can it? You saw it wrong.

322
00:18:50,134 --> 00:18:52,010
…will not be able
to leave this place alive."

323
00:18:56,473 --> 00:18:58,183
Look. The door is closed.

324
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,185
What? How come?

325
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:02,855
Are we trapped here?

326
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:05,899
That's why I didn't want to come!

327
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,985
This happened because
you underestimated the dungeon!

328
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,779
We never should have come here
in the first place.

329
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:11,697
I'm going back.

330
00:19:12,322 --> 00:19:15,033
You guys can have all the treasures.

331
00:19:15,576 --> 00:19:16,660
Goodbye.

332
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:19,371
{\an8}Get away from there!

333
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:38,390
No!

334
00:19:38,473 --> 00:19:39,892
-No way.
-It moved!

335
00:19:40,684 --> 00:19:42,978
Are we going to fight that?

336
00:19:44,813 --> 00:19:47,232
<i>What is the rank
of the person who just got killed?</i>

337
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:48,317
<i>D-rank?</i>

338
00:19:48,901 --> 00:19:51,695
<i>He was definitely stronger
than an E-rank hunter like me.</i>

339
00:19:53,238 --> 00:19:55,824
{\an8}<i>But he got killed in a blink of an eye.</i>

340
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,784
<i>This is strange.</i>

341
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,703
<i>Isn't this a D-rank dungeon?</i>

342
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:01,580
<i>How could such a creature be here?</i>

343
00:20:02,164 --> 00:20:04,249
If the statue can move…

344
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,209
Could it be…

345
00:20:19,306 --> 00:20:23,018
<i>I have been through
many life-and-death situations.</i>

346
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:27,189
<i>I got separated from the team
in my first raid mission.</i>

347
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:30,943
<i>I was injured by an E-rank magic beast
and hospitalized for several weeks.</i>

348
00:20:31,818 --> 00:20:34,738
<i>I also almost starved to death
when I was trapped in a maze.</i>

349
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:37,741
<i>Even a low-rank dungeon</i>

350
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:39,868
<i>is a life-and-death mission for me.</i>

351
00:20:40,953 --> 00:20:45,082
<i>Hunters spend the money earned
from magic gems on buying more weapons,</i>

352
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:47,167
<i>in order to defeat stronger magic beasts</i>

353
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:49,211
<i>and get higher rewards.</i>

354
00:20:50,003 --> 00:20:52,547
<i>However, I have nothing more
than a cheap little knife.</i>

355
00:20:52,631 --> 00:20:55,050
<i>If it gets damaged, I have to face
the magic beast bare-handed.</i>

356
00:20:57,552 --> 00:20:59,513
These shoes are also worn out.

357
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:03,225
<i>And it goes on and on.</i>

358
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,397
<i>I endure the ridicule of others.</i>

359
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,108
<i>I do this dangerous job
that doesn't earn much.</i>

360
00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:14,361
<i>In order to survive, I must
constantly look for loopholes.</i>

361
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:16,488
<i>I have to carefully observe
everything around me.</i>

362
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:18,907
<i>Maybe that's why</i>

363
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:20,575
<i>I know so well…</i>

364
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:22,244
Get down!

365
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:38,844
Is this a joke?

366
00:21:38,927 --> 00:21:39,803
How could this happen?

367
00:21:39,886 --> 00:21:40,804
What happened?

368
00:21:40,887 --> 00:21:41,722
How would I know?

369
00:21:41,805 --> 00:21:43,932
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

370
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:45,475
And you?

371
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:46,643
I'm fine too.

372
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:49,354
Don't…

373
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:52,316
<i>What is happening?</i>

374
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:55,027
<i>How did it end up like this?</i>

375
00:21:55,694 --> 00:21:57,988
<i>We're trapped, and there's no way out.</i>

376
00:21:58,071 --> 00:22:00,449
<i>I'm going to die.</i>

377
00:22:04,036 --> 00:22:05,329
<i>I'll be killed.</i>
