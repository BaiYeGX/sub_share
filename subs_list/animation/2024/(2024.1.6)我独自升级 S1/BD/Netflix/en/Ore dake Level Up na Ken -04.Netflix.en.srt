1
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:22,819
<i>I'm so agile.</i>

2
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:29,868
I've tried so hard
to get this second life.

3
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:31,703
<i>I can't succumb to fear.</i>

4
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:34,789
I can't die like this!

5
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:42,505
<i>Is it because my strength ability
has improved?</i>

6
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:47,218
<i>But… it's still stronger than me.</i>

7
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:52,682
<i>No, my attacks don't work.</i>

8
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,192
{\an8}<i>What should I do?</i>

9
00:02:42,876 --> 00:02:44,168
<i>It's too difficult alone.</i>

10
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,966
<i>There are no teammates or healers.</i>

11
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,176
<i>All I have is water and food.</i>

12
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:55,305
<i>If this goes on…</i>

13
00:02:56,931 --> 00:02:59,142
<i>If only I had a weapon with magic power…</i>

14
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:00,393
Weapon?

15
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:01,728
Inventory!

16
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:19,996
<i>Though I don't know why
this is in my inventory.</i>

17
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:25,084
Mr. Kim said this sword
cost him three million.

18
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:27,795
It's beyond my wildest dreams.

19
00:03:28,671 --> 00:03:30,006
I can't think about that now.

20
00:03:30,089 --> 00:03:31,341
I'll just use it.

21
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:33,676
My body stopped hurting.

22
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,264
As long as I have a weapon,

23
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,058
there's nothing to fear.

24
00:03:43,811 --> 00:03:45,730
What? The sword won't come out!

25
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:49,776
Please, come out!

26
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,454
Your steel fangs seem genuine.

27
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,540
I finally got this sword.

28
00:04:05,875 --> 00:04:08,002
Don't even try to damage it!

29
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,009
Upon closer inspection…

30
00:04:16,094 --> 00:04:17,553
<i>Compared to those things,</i>

31
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:20,014
these beasts are nothing.

32
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:39,409
Eh, I'm level 2 now.

33
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:42,495
I never leveled up
when I completed daily quests.

34
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:45,748
I see, because this is actual combat.

35
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:47,750
My wounds just healed also because…

36
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:52,297
If I level up, all my abilities
will increase by one point?

37
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:54,799
A total of five points.

38
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:56,926
I only get three points from daily quests.

39
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,512
So leveling up through combat is faster.

40
00:05:00,346 --> 00:05:04,017
How much will my abilities grow
with each point increase?

41
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,686
Even intelligence and perception
have been quantified.

42
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:09,689
Strength is the easiest to understand.

43
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:11,774
With only 32 points,

44
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:13,693
my movements became much lighter.

45
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:16,237
I'm only guessing.

46
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:18,740
But I think the higher the basic ability,

47
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:21,451
the more points I'll be able to get.

48
00:05:23,244 --> 00:05:26,205
So… I really can become stronger.

49
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:31,919
<i>But they are just five small magic beasts.</i>

50
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:33,546
<i>I may have got carried away.</i>

51
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:38,801
They have no magic gems on them?

52
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:44,515
I have got an item instead of a magic gem?

53
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,727
<i>Strange things are happening to me.</i>

54
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:51,522
<i>If I am controlled
by a system like a game,</i>

55
00:05:52,065 --> 00:05:56,194
<i>will this dungeon and magic beasts
differ from the ones in reality?</i>

56
00:05:57,862 --> 00:05:59,655
Ah, I found the shop.

57
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:01,199
Purchase.

58
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:04,827
New players can't use it?

59
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:06,579
Sell.

60
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,835
Twenty gold coins.

61
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:16,214
How much would that be in cash?

62
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:20,093
But this dungeon is at most E-rank,

63
00:06:20,176 --> 00:06:22,804
so 20 gold coins probably isn't much.

64
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,473
All right.

65
00:06:25,556 --> 00:06:26,766
What should I do now?

66
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:29,894
I can't leave unless I defeat the boss.

67
00:06:30,436 --> 00:06:33,106
It seems I could leave
once I get the teleportation stone,

68
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:35,316
but I have no idea where that is.

69
00:06:35,817 --> 00:06:38,027
{\an8}If this drags on, I'll be short of food.

70
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,699
Although it's an E-rank dungeon,

71
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:45,993
it's still so hard for me
to defeat the boss alone.

72
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:50,081
Wait… If I keep leveling up,
I might stand a chance.

73
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:56,003
Although it's possible
that I'll be dead before that.

74
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,601
There's nothing to be afraid of.

75
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:13,646
I've died once after all.

76
00:07:30,371 --> 00:07:32,874
I won't die that easily,

77
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,751
so don't die too quickly either.

78
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:39,589
If I kill you in an instant,

79
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:42,216
I'll feel really bad.

80
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:46,137
You have qualified as a hunter.

81
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:49,974
<i>Now I can pay mom's medical bills.</i>

82
00:07:50,057 --> 00:07:52,310
<i>If I could have another chance…</i>

83
00:07:55,354 --> 00:07:56,230
<i>Let's…</i>

84
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,858
{\an8}<i>Let's have a fierce battle.</i>

85
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,032
<i>As long as I'm alive,</i>

86
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,700
<i>I'll fight to the last moment.</i>

87
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:10,912
<i>As long as it makes me stronger…</i>

88
00:08:12,371 --> 00:08:15,082
<i>I can abide by any rules!</i>

89
00:08:24,884 --> 00:08:26,010
That doesn't look good.

90
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:28,554
Can't the guild
come to deal with it quickly?

91
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:41,567
This sword is almost done for.

92
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,489
<i>Weapons are just expendables after all.</i>

93
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,244
<i>No matter how much it costs, it will
wear out after a few times in the dungeon.</i>

94
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,162
<i>However…</i>

95
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:55,039
It seems like the battle is over.

96
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:02,838
Thirty-four wolf fangs.

97
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:05,132
Two worn-out short swords.

98
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:06,425
A traveler's attire.

99
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:08,302
And…

100
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:12,098
The teleportation stone
that was easier to get than I imagined.

101
00:09:13,391 --> 00:09:14,642
Should I return?

102
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:17,895
But,

103
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:21,440
perhaps there won't be a chance
to get stronger so easily again.

104
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:25,027
What will happen to this dungeon
if I use the teleportation stone?

105
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,529
Will it disappear?

106
00:09:27,488 --> 00:09:32,076
Like a time-limited event in a game?

107
00:09:33,452 --> 00:09:34,579
Regardless,

108
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:37,707
it seems like I am being toyed
with by some unknown force.

109
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,669
And I cannot escape.

110
00:09:44,463 --> 00:09:47,341
Should I continue forward or turn back?

111
00:10:03,441 --> 00:10:04,984
Yes, this is Lee Joohee.

112
00:10:06,027 --> 00:10:08,070
Ah, you're from the Hunter's Association.

113
00:10:08,654 --> 00:10:10,573
I'm really sorry about earlier.

114
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:15,745
That gate had a Dungeon Break?

115
00:10:16,245 --> 00:10:17,788
It's right around here.

116
00:10:18,581 --> 00:10:20,625
<i>It's all because I rejected him.</i>

117
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:24,962
<i>We're currently assembling
available hunters to deal with it.</i>

118
00:10:25,046 --> 00:10:27,590
<i>But there's a serious shortage of healers.</i>

119
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,305
I understand…

120
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:37,725
{\an8}<i>With each level up,</i>

121
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:41,771
{\an8}<i>my battles with magic beasts
become easier.</i>

122
00:10:50,738 --> 00:10:53,532
<i>The color denoting
the magic beast's name also changes.</i>

123
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:56,369
<i>I guess white means it's weaker than me.</i>

124
00:10:56,452 --> 00:10:58,037
<i>Orange means it has the same level as me.</i>

125
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:00,331
<i>And red means it's stronger than me.</i>

126
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:03,834
<i>Lycan, which was initially marked red,</i>

127
00:11:03,918 --> 00:11:05,628
<i>is marked white now.</i>

128
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:08,756
<i>This indicates I have become
much stronger.</i>

129
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:10,841
<i>Even so…</i>

130
00:11:10,925 --> 00:11:14,178
<i>I still feel that I can't defeat
the one below with my current strength.</i>

131
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:17,515
I don't know if it's because
my perception has improved.

132
00:11:18,015 --> 00:11:19,642
I can clearly feel

133
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:22,478
that the monster below

134
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:24,230
is terrifying.

135
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:29,318
It seems I can no longer level up here.

136
00:11:30,277 --> 00:11:32,780
If I keep fighting like this,
this sword probably won't hold up.

137
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:49,088
Are the stairs at this station so long?

138
00:12:03,644 --> 00:12:05,438
It no longer looks like a station.

139
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:13,320
<i>So fast!</i>

140
00:12:18,242 --> 00:12:19,118
<i>The sword…</i>

141
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:27,084
<i>I've leveled up a lot,</i>

142
00:12:27,918 --> 00:12:29,462
<i>but its name</i>

143
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:32,173
<i>is still in orange.</i>

144
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:36,218
You're the boss here, right?

145
00:12:37,136 --> 00:12:40,306
<i>It's covered in scales.
This sword is useless against it.</i>

146
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:42,641
<i>Going bare-handed will be worse.</i>

147
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,488
<i>Its attacks are fast and heavy.</i>

148
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:58,032
<i>I can only try
to weaken its defense first.</i>

149
00:12:58,532 --> 00:13:01,076
<i>But how can I pierce through
these thick scales?</i>

150
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:11,086
<i>If I took this hit head-on,</i>

151
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,004
<i>I would be dead.</i>

152
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:35,194
{\an8}<i>I thought I had become a bit stronger…</i>

153
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:47,498
<i>Is it still not enough?</i>

154
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:51,460
<i>How strong do I have to be</i>

155
00:13:52,836 --> 00:13:56,507
<i>to escape this life of constant ridicule?!</i>

156
00:14:01,262 --> 00:14:03,180
<i>The Weakest Hunter of All Mankind?</i>

157
00:14:03,764 --> 00:14:06,600
Everyone has been calling you that lately.

158
00:14:06,684 --> 00:14:07,518
Yes.

159
00:14:07,601 --> 00:14:09,103
Damn it.

160
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,564
There are always people
who speak childishly.

161
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:15,442
Work hard and make them change their mind.

162
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:18,988
Yes.

163
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:20,114
I understand.

164
00:14:37,756 --> 00:14:40,384
{\an8}They gave me that nickname
because I was too weak.

165
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:43,762
{\an8}I was looked down upon
because I was too weak.

166
00:14:46,223 --> 00:14:48,434
I was ashamed of myself.

167
00:14:49,768 --> 00:14:51,186
If only I were strong…

168
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:56,567
<i>One with overwhelming power
can naturally remain undefeated.</i>

169
00:14:57,192 --> 00:14:59,862
<i>The weak are powerless before the strong.</i>

170
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:03,574
<i>The weak can only stand still,
trembling in fear.</i>

171
00:15:04,158 --> 00:15:05,826
<i>People are looked down upon
because they are weak.</i>

172
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:10,581
<i>Even if they're knowledgeable,
smart, or considerate,</i>

173
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:13,083
<i>before the strong,</i>

174
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:16,128
{\an8}they will be betrayed.

175
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:18,547
Gentleness is meaningless.

176
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:19,965
So I must become stronger.

177
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,092
That's why I came here!

178
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,524
I…

179
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:45,866
I must become stronger.

180
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:53,082
<i>Not enough.</i>

181
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,377
{\an8}<i>Compared to that thing,</i>

182
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,420
{\an8}<i>compared to the fear back then,</i>

183
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:01,298
<i>you have nothing to make me afraid!</i>

184
00:16:15,854 --> 00:16:18,857
{\an8}<i>I've put all my ability points
into strength.</i>

185
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:25,531
<i>With my current self…</i>

186
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:31,745
{\an8}With my current self…

187
00:16:33,288 --> 00:16:36,583
I'm going to kill you!

188
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:42,464
Die!

189
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,539
It seems

190
00:17:15,622 --> 00:17:18,042
I have gotten a bit stronger.

191
00:17:27,051 --> 00:17:29,928
Thanks to that, I got good stuff.

192
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:33,766
This dagger isn't made from bone
but from teeth?

193
00:17:35,476 --> 00:17:38,062
Its power is twice that
of Mr. Kim's sword,

194
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:40,522
and it comes with paralysis
and bleeding effects.

195
00:17:41,106 --> 00:17:42,900
By comparison,

196
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:44,943
this thing is too terrifying to use.

197
00:17:45,027 --> 00:17:46,737
Anyway, I'll collect it for now.

198
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:57,748
Is it over?

199
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,302
<i>Not a person in sight.</i>

200
00:18:10,385 --> 00:18:11,512
<i>What time is it?</i>

201
00:18:12,137 --> 00:18:13,430
Hey!

202
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:14,932
How can you just walk in here?

203
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:17,643
Didn't you hear the announcement?

204
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:18,811
Announcement?

205
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:20,437
Don't play dumb with me…

206
00:18:21,605 --> 00:18:23,482
Are you a hunter?

207
00:18:23,565 --> 00:18:25,734
Yes, I am a hunter.

208
00:18:25,818 --> 00:18:27,236
Sorry for being rude.

209
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,821
I'll take you to the site.

210
00:18:28,904 --> 00:18:29,780
This way, please.

211
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:30,781
Ah, okay.

212
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:33,575
<i>Has something happened?</i>

213
00:18:39,164 --> 00:18:40,666
Dungeon Break…

214
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:43,252
Did magic beasts get out?

215
00:18:43,335 --> 00:18:45,921
Almost all of them have been killed.

216
00:18:46,004 --> 00:18:48,549
Only a giant magic beast has been left.

217
00:18:48,632 --> 00:18:51,093
<i>I don't know if it's because
my perception has improved.</i>

218
00:18:52,094 --> 00:18:53,137
<i>I can feel it.</i>

219
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:55,556
<i>That thing over there is the boss.</i>

220
00:19:01,478 --> 00:19:03,188
Please do not take photos.

221
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:04,940
This place is very dangerous.

222
00:19:06,942 --> 00:19:08,152
Kill it quickly.

223
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:10,821
What if the land prices here drop?

224
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:12,823
All healers!

225
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:15,242
Please focus on healing the tanker!

226
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:17,119
I don't need you to tell me!

227
00:19:19,496 --> 00:19:21,665
What are the fighters doing?

228
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:24,334
Why is it not weakening at all?

229
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:27,921
Its defense is just too strong.

230
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:30,424
We have few mages among us.

231
00:19:30,507 --> 00:19:32,176
Excuse me, let us through!

232
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:34,303
<i>Is it because it's a temporary team?</i>

233
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:35,554
<i>They don't work well together.</i>

234
00:19:37,514 --> 00:19:38,932
<i>Their ranks are low too.</i>

235
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:43,270
<i>It should be eight E-rank hunters
and one D-rank hunter.</i>

236
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:45,564
<i>And because that tanker is D-rank,</i>

237
00:19:45,647 --> 00:19:48,150
<i>it became a prolonged battle
as no one could deliver a fatal blow.</i>

238
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:52,112
<i>As for the healers, are they
two D-rank healers and one B-rank healer?</i>

239
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:54,489
Hey, Miss!

240
00:19:54,573 --> 00:19:56,533
Hurry up and heal them!

241
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,327
Aren't you a B-rank healer?

242
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:00,370
What are you dazed about?

243
00:20:00,454 --> 00:20:01,622
O-Okay.

244
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,585
Damn it, pull yourself together.

245
00:20:11,882 --> 00:20:15,344
<i>She still hasn't gotten over it
after a week?</i>

246
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,262
<i>It's no surprise.</i>

247
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:19,223
<i>After all, I also…</i>

248
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:21,642
No.

249
00:20:24,895 --> 00:20:26,063
<i>This is a D-rank boss.</i>

250
00:20:27,731 --> 00:20:30,234
<i>It's weaker than the one I just defeated.</i>

251
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,779
We'll get wiped out if this continues!

252
00:20:33,862 --> 00:20:35,739
We can't defeat it
without a high-rank hunter!

253
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:38,450
<i>As long as I can break its defense,</i>

254
00:20:39,284 --> 00:20:40,118
<i>I can defeat it!</i>

255
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,792
<i>I'll give it the most powerful hit.</i>

256
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:48,794
<i>Take this!</i>

257
00:20:51,421 --> 00:20:53,423
Good, its defense is broken.

258
00:20:53,507 --> 00:20:54,341
We can defeat it.

259
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:03,892
We did it.

260
00:21:03,976 --> 00:21:05,686
We defeated it!

261
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:09,273
<i>All attacks were ineffective against it.</i>

262
00:21:09,356 --> 00:21:11,525
<i>Why were we able to break its defense?</i>

263
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:14,861
<i>Our attacks had no effect.</i>

264
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:17,614
<i>It was something that flew over…</i>

265
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,204
<i>A Boss Golem that remained unscathed
under the attack of a dozen hunters</i>

266
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:25,998
<i>was defeated by this thing?</i>

267
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,668
-Sorry.
-Yes.

268
00:21:30,252 --> 00:21:32,629
Who threw this?

269
00:21:32,713 --> 00:21:34,840
Oh, it was the hunter over there…

270
00:21:35,674 --> 00:21:36,717
Huh?

271
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,261
-He was just here.
<i>-Such terrifying destructive power.</i>

272
00:21:40,637 --> 00:21:42,514
<i>Is he a high-rank hunter?</i>

273
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,982
I didn't expect to take it down
with a single strike.

274
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:55,569
Perhaps that Golem
was running out of vitality anyway.

275
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:01,908
Jinwoo?
