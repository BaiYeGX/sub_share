1
00:00:12,684 --> 00:00:13,685
<i>If…</i>

2
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:26,781
<i>If I could have another chance…</i>

3
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:36,082
Hospital.

4
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:40,503
My hand is all right…

5
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:50,513
My feet too…

6
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:55,310
<i>Not a scratch on my chest
where I got stabbed.</i>

7
00:00:56,478 --> 00:00:58,813
Was it a dream?

8
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:04,152
You woke up?

9
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:06,529
I…

10
00:01:08,573 --> 00:01:12,160
I'm the chief of the Surveillance Team
in Hunter's Association, Woo Jinchul.

11
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:13,244
I'm Kang Taeshik.

12
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,954
Surveillance Team…

13
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:16,956
Why are you here to see me?

14
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:18,583
Well,

15
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,043
I'll call the doctor over first.

16
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,011
What?

17
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:55,763
I've been unconscious for three days?

18
00:02:56,723 --> 00:02:58,641
What about Joohee and Mr. Song?

19
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:00,143
Are they okay?

20
00:03:00,226 --> 00:03:01,895
They're fine. But…

21
00:03:02,937 --> 00:03:05,565
<i>Hunter Song Chiyul lost an arm.</i>

22
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:08,026
<i>He might choose to retire.</i>

23
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,695
<i>As for Hunter Lee Joohee,</i>

24
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:12,655
<i>she's suffered significant
psychological trauma</i>

25
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,365
<i>and is currently undergoing treatment.</i>

26
00:03:14,449 --> 00:03:16,284
<i>Judging from her condition,</i>

27
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,703
<i>it's uncertain whether she can
continue to work as a hunter.</i>

28
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:29,631
Only six people came back alive

29
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:31,507
from the double dungeon.

30
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:35,303
The hunter profession
inherently comes with risks,

31
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:37,472
such a casualty is still rare.

32
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:40,850
And for some reason,

33
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:44,771
<i>when we received reports
from the survivors</i>

34
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:48,107
<i>and got there with members
of the White Tiger Guild,</i>

35
00:03:52,654 --> 00:03:55,740
they only found you lying there.

36
00:03:55,823 --> 00:03:59,953
There were no traces
of any temple or statues.

37
00:04:00,036 --> 00:04:01,162
But how…

38
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:02,664
Hard to believe, isn't it?

39
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,794
If there were any inconsistencies
in the survivors' statements

40
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:11,673
or if no corpses were found at the scene,

41
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:14,801
we would be suspicious of you.

42
00:04:15,635 --> 00:04:16,844
What?

43
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:17,762
By the way,

44
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:21,015
although this is just our speculation…

45
00:04:22,809 --> 00:04:24,269
Hunter Sung Jinwoo.

46
00:04:24,352 --> 00:04:25,645
Please tell me,

47
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:28,398
have you experienced a Reawakening?

48
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:31,985
<i>Reawakening…</i>

49
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:37,657
<i>A hunter's ability is set
at the time of awakening</i>

50
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,325
<i>and will not change in their lifetime.</i>

51
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:43,413
{\an8}<i>However, a very few hunters
will experience a second awakening.</i>

52
00:04:44,664 --> 00:04:46,207
<i>They'll surpass their limits</i>

53
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:48,001
<i>and become A-rank or S-rank hunters.</i>

54
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:50,336
{\an8}<i>Did I also…</i>

55
00:04:52,463 --> 00:04:53,715
This is a magic power detector.

56
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:56,092
Please place your hand on this.

57
00:04:57,927 --> 00:04:59,679
{\an8}<i>If what the survivors said is true</i>

58
00:04:59,762 --> 00:05:02,557
{\an8}<i>and there were magic beasts
that killed people with ease,</i>

59
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,851
<i>no low-rank hunters would survive.</i>

60
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:08,062
<i>However, those magic beasts
disappeared without a trace.</i>

61
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:09,605
<i>Only A-rank, no…</i>

62
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:11,816
<i>Only S-rank hunters
would be capable of that.</i>

63
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:15,862
<i>That's why we suspect that he had
undergone a second awakening.</i>

64
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:20,783
What does it say?

65
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:23,202
If I had a second awakening,
what rank would I be?

66
00:05:24,495 --> 00:05:25,496
It seems…

67
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,166
We should apologize.

68
00:05:30,585 --> 00:05:33,296
Even an E-rank hunter
would have at least 70…

69
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:35,381
He's basically like an ordinary man.

70
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:39,552
<i>The dungeon has disappeared
and can no longer be investigated.</i>

71
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:42,430
<i>How on earth did he survive?</i>

72
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:44,557
What…

73
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,142
Got me excited for nothing.

74
00:05:48,102 --> 00:05:49,187
<i>By the way,</i>

75
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,773
<i>don't those people care about this thing?</i>

76
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:55,610
Is it because

77
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:57,028
only I can see it?

78
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,033
<i>This isn't a touch-sensitive screen?</i>

79
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:19,258
<i>I saw this too at that time…</i>

80
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,220
Jinah.

81
00:06:24,222 --> 00:06:26,224
You should take better care of yourself.

82
00:06:26,307 --> 00:06:27,934
I'm terribly worried!

83
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:29,393
Sorry…

84
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:31,729
Why is everyone else okay?

85
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:34,232
Why do you get injured all the time?

86
00:06:34,315 --> 00:06:36,400
I was really worried.

87
00:06:36,484 --> 00:06:39,237
<i>I actually thought
of leaving her and dying…</i>

88
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,447
Why are you smiling?

89
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,782
If you risk your life again,

90
00:06:42,865 --> 00:06:47,120
I'll drop out of school and work,
so you won't have to be a hunter.

91
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:48,871
I got it, sorry.

92
00:06:49,372 --> 00:06:51,499
By the way, Jinah, can you see this?

93
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,209
See what?

94
00:06:53,292 --> 00:06:54,877
Sorry, it's nothing.

95
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:57,046
A question.

96
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,174
There are unread messages in games, right?

97
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:01,509
Games?

98
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:04,137
How can I read them?

99
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,180
Maybe you should get your brain checked.

100
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:08,933
Jinah, didn't you used to play
video games?

101
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:10,393
I did.

102
00:07:10,476 --> 00:07:12,478
Just open the message box.

103
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:15,314
Open the message box?

104
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:18,484
Why did you bring up games?

105
00:07:18,568 --> 00:07:20,361
Well, I have nothing to do
in the hospital.

106
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,823
<i>I think it mentioned
"player" or something.</i>

107
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:27,952
Looks like you are fine.

108
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:28,870
I'll be going then.

109
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:33,124
Song-Yi, sorry to keep you waiting.

110
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,212
"This system is designed to assist
the development of the player."

111
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:43,176
"Failure to comply with the system
may result in a penalty."

112
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:44,886
"The rewards have been delivered."

113
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:47,680
I don't understand this at all.

114
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:51,684
"Daily quest,
strength training has arrived."

115
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:52,727
Confirm.

116
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,440
"Push-ups, sit-ups, squats, running."

117
00:07:58,065 --> 00:08:01,360
"Failure to complete the daily quest
will result in an appropriate penalty"?

118
00:08:02,778 --> 00:08:03,905
What is this?

119
00:08:04,447 --> 00:08:06,574
Let's not joke about that.

120
00:08:07,408 --> 00:08:10,536
I'm hospitalized, so I don't have
the strength to do those things.

121
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:12,914
What is going on?

122
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,001
That hunter, Sung Jinwoo,

123
00:08:17,585 --> 00:08:20,087
shows no signs of a second awakening.

124
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:21,005
President Go.

125
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:22,215
<i>I see.</i>

126
00:08:22,882 --> 00:08:26,177
<i>We're lucky that there was
no Dungeon Break.</i>

127
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,179
<i>But this incident</i>

128
00:08:28,262 --> 00:08:30,014
<i>is still too puzzling.</i>

129
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:31,057
Yes.

130
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,434
This case is different
from all previous ones.

131
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:36,562
<i>Although there are still many
mysteries in the dungeon…</i>

132
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:40,149
<i>I understand.
Let's list this case as special.</i>

133
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,818
<i>File it in the database,
and we will discuss it later.</i>

134
00:08:42,902 --> 00:08:44,111
Understood.

135
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:48,950
Thank you for your hard work.

136
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,249
Hunter Cha,

137
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:59,210
I'd like you to be the instructor
for the next B-rank raid mission.

138
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:01,420
I'll be the instructor?

139
00:09:01,504 --> 00:09:05,716
This raid mission will also be
an on-site practice for the rookies.

140
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,009
We'll appreciate your efforts.

141
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:09,887
But I don't feel suited
for being an instructor.

142
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:13,224
You just need to fight as usual.

143
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:15,476
They will learn from watching you.

144
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,104
That's how influential your strength is.

145
00:09:20,022 --> 00:09:24,318
Although our Hunters Guild is one
of the five major guilds in the country,

146
00:09:25,069 --> 00:09:27,029
we're still not strong enough worldwide.

147
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:30,616
The rank of hunters is set,

148
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,286
but combat abilities
can be improved through practice,

149
00:09:34,453 --> 00:09:37,123
in order to face the moment
that is approaching.

150
00:09:44,338 --> 00:09:45,965
A gate again?

151
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,886
Why did a gate appear here?

152
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,638
Haven't the hunters arrived yet?

153
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:54,682
I hope they can hurry up
and get rid of it.

154
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:09,655
An earthquake?

155
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:23,586
A desert?

156
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:24,503
What is going on?

157
00:10:25,504 --> 00:10:26,756
Am I dreaming?

158
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:28,007
Wasn't I just in the ward?

159
00:10:36,641 --> 00:10:38,517
No way…

160
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:46,776
What?

161
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:49,111
What's wrong?

162
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:50,905
The patient in this ward…

163
00:11:09,423 --> 00:11:11,509
How many ones are there?

164
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:16,931
Still two hours left…

165
00:11:17,556 --> 00:11:18,849
Did you find him?

166
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:20,184
No.

167
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:23,687
-I will check the ward again.
-Okay.

168
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:26,857
I think he should still be
in the hospital…

169
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:31,946
I can't… carry on anymore…

170
00:11:57,596 --> 00:12:00,433
"Penalty… Quest…"

171
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:04,937
Mr. Sung?

172
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:08,524
Mr. Sung, are you all right?

173
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:12,987
Yeah.

174
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,488
I am recovering very well.

175
00:12:14,572 --> 00:12:16,949
I should be able to go home soon.

176
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:17,867
<i>That's great.</i>

177
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,952
<i>I was really worried about you.</i>

178
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:22,121
<i>After you're discharged,
you should take me to Chagall.</i>

179
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:24,206
Okay, I got it.

180
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,960
Okay, let's go.

181
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,506
Eh, you want me on a raid mission?

182
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,216
<i>Yes.</i>

183
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,678
<i>A D-rank gate appeared
at Hapjeong lately.</i>

184
00:12:37,761 --> 00:12:40,222
<i>All guilds are short on manpower.</i>

185
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,476
<i>Of course, it's not mandatory
for you to go.</i>

186
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:46,979
<i>I'm aware of your current situation.</i>

187
00:12:47,563 --> 00:12:48,439
I'm sorry…

188
00:12:48,522 --> 00:12:50,191
<i>No, don't worry about it.</i>

189
00:12:50,274 --> 00:12:51,734
<i>Ah, right.</i>

190
00:12:51,817 --> 00:12:54,695
<i>I heard that Hunter Sung Jinwoo
had woken up.</i>

191
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:55,905
Really?

192
00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:05,789
<i>So Jinwoo is fine.</i>

193
00:13:05,873 --> 00:13:06,957
<i>That's great…</i>

194
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:12,421
Look, he's running again.

195
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,173
{\an8}Geez…

196
00:13:14,256 --> 00:13:17,051
{\an8}It's been like this every day
since he woke up.

197
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:21,222
Jinwoo…

198
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:25,267
Unlike ordinary people,
hunters can recover quickly.

199
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:27,436
But he said he wants to get more strength.

200
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,189
I told him not to push himself,
but he didn't listen.

201
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:31,857
He just recovered from a severe injury.

202
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:33,400
It's quite worrying.

203
00:13:35,402 --> 00:13:37,738
<i>Today is the fourth day since I woke up.</i>

204
00:13:38,364 --> 00:13:39,573
<i>I've figured out a few things.</i>

205
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:41,408
<i>First of all,</i>

206
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:43,494
<i>this thing in front of me
isn't my illusion.</i>

207
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,705
<i>If I complete the daily quest,</i>

208
00:13:46,789 --> 00:13:48,457
<i>I can get three rewards.</i>

209
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,000
Recovery.

210
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:53,504
My fatigue is instantly gone.

211
00:13:55,923 --> 00:13:57,466
Next is Ability Points.

212
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,803
{\an8}<i>I can allocate the points
to the abilities I want to improve.</i>

213
00:14:01,845 --> 00:14:03,305
<i>Strength is the most important.</i>

214
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:07,059
<i>When the Ability Points increase,
I become stronger.</i>

215
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:10,062
<i>I do feel that my strength has increased.</i>

216
00:14:10,145 --> 00:14:12,856
<i>There are also skills
and the item warehouse.</i>

217
00:14:13,607 --> 00:14:16,986
<i>I'm witnessing these amazing things.</i>

218
00:14:18,404 --> 00:14:20,030
It's like a game.

219
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:29,623
<i>The last daily quest reward</i>

220
00:14:29,707 --> 00:14:31,166
<i>is this random box.</i>

221
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,751
What will it be today?

222
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:41,468
A key?

223
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:48,309
I always get useless things
like a pen or a band-aid.

224
00:14:49,518 --> 00:14:51,103
"Instance dungeon"?

225
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:52,563
What is that?

226
00:14:55,107 --> 00:14:59,111
It should also be part
of the strength training.

227
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:05,784
<i>Next is today's update on the gate.</i>

228
00:15:05,868 --> 00:15:09,663
<i>New D-rank gates emerged
at locations on the screen.</i>

229
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:14,710
<i>C-rank gates in the eastern and central
regions are currently being dealt with.</i>

230
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:18,923
<i>The B-rank gate appeared days ago
at the harbor area</i>

231
00:15:19,006 --> 00:15:23,302
<i>and is expected to be dealt with
by the Hunters Guild soon.</i>

232
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:27,306
{\an8}<i>Traffic control will be implemented
during this period.</i>

233
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,601
<i>Residents nearby and commuters,
please pay extra attention.</i>

234
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:33,854
Understood, I'll head back
to headquarters first.

235
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:34,772
Sorry.

236
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:45,449
{\an8}Mom!

237
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:47,117
Mom, wake up!

238
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:48,369
What's wrong?

239
00:15:48,452 --> 00:15:49,870
Mom is…

240
00:15:49,954 --> 00:15:51,330
I can't wake her up.

241
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:54,291
Eternal Slumber…

242
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,878
Also known as the Final Sleep.

243
00:15:57,962 --> 00:16:00,965
It's a condition that arose
after the gates appeared.

244
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:03,842
It afflicts one in tens of thousands.

245
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:09,056
Rumors say it's due to
prolonged exposure to Mana.

246
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:11,225
Anyway, with the current
medical technology,

247
00:16:11,308 --> 00:16:12,893
we can only do so much to keep her alive.

248
00:16:14,603 --> 00:16:16,230
Hey, kid!

249
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:18,273
Don't dawdle!

250
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:19,233
Yes.

251
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:33,080
Congratulations,

252
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:35,624
you have qualified as a hunter.

253
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,003
We look forward
to your future contributions.

254
00:16:41,171 --> 00:16:42,506
It's great, Jinah.

255
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:44,967
Now I can pay mom's medical bills.

256
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,885
But, isn't that dangerous?

257
00:16:46,969 --> 00:16:48,679
No worries.

258
00:16:48,762 --> 00:16:49,888
I've got this.

259
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,024
What are you doing?

260
00:17:00,107 --> 00:17:02,484
Just stay in the corner.

261
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:05,696
An E-rank hunter is just a hindrance.

262
00:17:08,574 --> 00:17:09,825
Let me make this clear.

263
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:12,745
Those who don't work
don't get to share the spoils.

264
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:16,415
Sorry, I couldn't help…

265
00:17:19,001 --> 00:17:20,586
Ability Points.

266
00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:21,754
Strength.

267
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,308
<i>I've got all my gear.</i>

268
00:17:35,309 --> 00:17:36,810
<i>All preparations are done.</i>

269
00:17:38,312 --> 00:17:40,230
<i>I'm confident in my ability to escape.</i>

270
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:43,442
<i>If it gets dangerous like last time,
I'll just run with all my might.</i>

271
00:18:26,735 --> 00:18:27,820
Is it…

272
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:31,490
The entrance is blocked?

273
00:18:38,372 --> 00:18:39,706
<i>I see…</i>

274
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,750
<i>This is a different dimension.</i>

275
00:18:42,876 --> 00:18:45,504
<i>Instance dungeons differ
from regular dungeons.</i>

276
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:47,589
<i>I've never been in one,</i>

277
00:18:47,673 --> 00:18:50,717
<i>but I guess it should be similar
to a Red Gate.</i>

278
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:52,302
{\an8}What a headache.

279
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:54,972
{\an8}I thought if things went wrong,
at least I could run away.

280
00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:56,765
{\an8}Now there's nowhere to go.

281
00:18:58,642 --> 00:18:59,852
"Teleportation stone"?

282
00:19:00,477 --> 00:19:01,562
What now?

283
00:19:01,645 --> 00:19:04,064
I can't get out unless I defeat the boss?

284
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,985
I couldn't even defeat
an E-rank magic beast.

285
00:19:08,068 --> 00:19:10,529
Now I have to conquer this dungeon alone?

286
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:11,697
It's too difficult for me.

287
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,576
Do I really have to fight the boss

288
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:17,077
without a team?

289
00:19:18,162 --> 00:19:19,121
But…

290
00:19:19,204 --> 00:19:20,164
I have no choice.

291
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:32,467
What should I do…

292
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,887
I'm losing my confidence.

293
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:42,311
Beasts! And three ones at a time!

294
00:20:34,613 --> 00:20:35,447
<i>I killed it.</i>

295
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,971
I really became stronger…

296
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:12,025
<i>Wolf.</i>

297
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,152
<i>I can feel it…</i>

298
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:19,032
{\an8}<i>It's much stronger
than the goblins just now.</i>

299
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:23,704
My legs…

300
00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:24,746
I can't move.

301
00:21:25,455 --> 00:21:26,999
<i>What's going on…</i>

302
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:29,626
<i>Is it because of fear?</i>

303
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,337
<i>Although I thought I didn't get trauma…</i>

304
00:21:34,256 --> 00:21:35,090
Damn it.

305
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:44,558
<i>There is no healer.</i>

306
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,269
<i>If I get injured, it's all over.</i>
