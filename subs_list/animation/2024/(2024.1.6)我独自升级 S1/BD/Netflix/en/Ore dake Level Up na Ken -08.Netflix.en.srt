1
00:00:09,431 --> 00:00:11,933
{\an8}<i>The potion that cures all diseases?</i>

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:20,692
<i>With this potion,</i>

3
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:23,403
<i>perhaps it could cure
my mother's Eternal Slumber.</i>

4
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:27,866
<i>Creating Elixir of Life
requires three items.</i>

5
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:30,285
<i>I don't have any of them yet,</i>

6
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:32,787
<i>but I know where to find them.</i>

7
00:00:33,872 --> 00:00:34,748
<i>However…</i>

8
00:00:34,831 --> 00:00:38,251
<i>With my current strength, entering
that gate would be committing suicide.</i>

9
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:40,712
<i>I must level up even higher.</i>

10
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:43,173
I must…

11
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:46,217
become stronger.

12
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:20,228
Eh, you decided to accept it?

13
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,230
The situation is different now.

14
00:02:22,313 --> 00:02:25,900
For your proposal
for 19 C-rank raid missions, I'm in.

15
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:27,861
That's great.

16
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:29,696
But I have one condition.

17
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:32,031
Just say it.

18
00:02:33,825 --> 00:02:34,993
Just you and me.

19
00:02:35,076 --> 00:02:36,327
The two of us.

20
00:02:38,872 --> 00:02:43,167
Just the two of us
to conquer C-rank dungeons?

21
00:02:44,127 --> 00:02:45,086
That's right.

22
00:02:46,838 --> 00:02:49,507
But… to enter the C-rank gate,

23
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:52,176
we need at least eight people, don't we?

24
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:55,054
Just find people to make up the numbers,

25
00:02:55,638 --> 00:02:58,099
like what Hwang Dongsuk did.

26
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:02,020
B-But…

27
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:03,479
isn't it too dangerous?

28
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:05,523
It depends on how you see it.

29
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:07,650
As long as the two of us are safe,

30
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:10,904
we can complete the 19 raid missions
without anyone getting hurt.

31
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,449
{\an8}A team unscathed
in 19 consecutive missions.

32
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:19,162
Isn't that a perfect way
to make your father acknowledge you?

33
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:20,914
I see.

34
00:03:25,293 --> 00:03:26,836
Let's do it, Jinwoo.

35
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,756
I'll take care
of team members and the gate.

36
00:04:08,544 --> 00:04:09,671
Come out.

37
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:10,964
What do you want?

38
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:13,508
Truly surprising.

39
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:16,010
No wonder you're an S-rank hunter.

40
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:19,347
I couldn't find the right moment
to speak to you.

41
00:04:20,056 --> 00:04:21,849
Sorry for disturbing you
during your training.

42
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:24,060
{\an8}Here is my business card.

43
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:36,698
It's been over a decade
since the gates appeared.

44
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:39,993
The world has changed drastically.

45
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:45,373
Now infrastructure, economy,
media, and even politics

46
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:48,459
are all inextricably linked
to the dungeon.

47
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,839
Especially the infrastructure
that is vital to the common people.

48
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:56,301
Without resources from the dungeon,
it'd be hard to sustain operations.

49
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:01,848
And the only ones who can bring
such valuable resources back

50
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:03,766
are the hunters.

51
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,978
And the one managing these hunters

52
00:05:07,603 --> 00:05:10,773
{\an8}is the government agency
known as Hunter's Association.

53
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:16,404
<i>The Hunter's Association
will classify awakened hunters,</i>

54
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:18,823
<i>register and manage them accordingly.</i>

55
00:05:19,657 --> 00:05:22,285
<i>They assign manpower
to deal with unwanted gates</i>

56
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:24,871
<i>and also bear the heavy responsibility
in Dungeon Breaks.</i>

57
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:29,709
But in the end, the association
is just a government agency.

58
00:05:29,792 --> 00:05:34,797
Most of the resources needed
to sustain our society are brought back

59
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,010
{\an8}by guilds, the corporations
that center around hunters.

60
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:42,930
The guilds obtain massive profits
from the resources

61
00:05:43,014 --> 00:05:44,724
acquired from the dungeons.

62
00:05:45,475 --> 00:05:48,728
<i>Among them, Hunters Guild,
White Tiger Guild,</i>

63
00:05:48,811 --> 00:05:52,482
<i>Feind Guild, Fame Guild, and Knights Guild</i>

64
00:05:52,565 --> 00:05:54,734
<i>are the five major guilds in the country.</i>

65
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,072
<i>These guilds have almost
monopolized all the resources.</i>

66
00:06:00,782 --> 00:06:04,452
I cannot just sit here and watch.

67
00:06:05,036 --> 00:06:08,456
Not to mention letting
these resources vital to the people

68
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:11,876
fall into the hands of those brutes.

69
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,963
It should be us, who have supported
the nation's development,

70
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:18,091
to take on the responsibility
to manage them.

71
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:21,552
For this purpose,

72
00:06:21,636 --> 00:06:23,888
we must establish a guild.

73
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:26,349
Yes.

74
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:30,436
<i>That being said,</i>

75
00:06:30,937 --> 00:06:34,732
{\an8}<i>headhunting S-rank hunters
to make them run a guild with my brother</i>

76
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:35,900
{\an8}<i>is too risky.</i>

77
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,235
<i>But,</i>

78
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:39,112
<i>my current self…</i>

79
00:06:54,585 --> 00:06:57,588
It stopped counting the quests
that exceeded the goal?

80
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:03,719
<i>Does it mean I can't get the reward
for the previous secret quest,</i>

81
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:05,763
<i>the Cursed Random Loot Box?</i>

82
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,477
<i>I thought I could get another item
like the Demon Castle's Key.</i>

83
00:07:12,186 --> 00:07:13,020
<i>No.</i>

84
00:07:13,604 --> 00:07:15,523
<i>Even if it's a regular random box,</i>

85
00:07:15,606 --> 00:07:19,902
<i>it's possible to get something
like an instance dungeon's key.</i>

86
00:07:28,244 --> 00:07:29,370
Or maybe not.

87
00:07:33,124 --> 00:07:38,254
{\an8}<i>At this level, three ability points
are no longer enough.</i>

88
00:07:39,088 --> 00:07:41,674
{\an8}<i>I really want to level up quickly,</i>

89
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:44,719
{\an8}<i>but now I can only wait
for Jinho's C-rank dungeon missions.</i>

90
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:47,805
<i>That's right.</i>

91
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:49,015
<i>Penalty Zone.</i>

92
00:07:49,098 --> 00:07:50,808
<i>If I kill those centipedes there…</i>

93
00:07:51,601 --> 00:07:52,518
<i>No.</i>

94
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:55,229
<i>Now I might escape
more easily than before.</i>

95
00:07:55,313 --> 00:07:56,355
<i>But to defeat it…</i>

96
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:59,233
<i>Besides, I might not be able
to gain any points.</i>

97
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,490
<i>D-rank gate mission?</i>

98
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,951
<i>It's a request from the
Hunter's Association for making up a team,</i>

99
00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:12,580
<i>which means I can't fight alone.</i>

100
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,081
<i>Should I refuse?</i>

101
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:18,503
Well, it's better than nothing.

102
00:08:23,216 --> 00:08:24,634
I have no time to waste.

103
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,647
I still can't defeat you, Master.

104
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:42,151
It won't be so easy for you to defeat me.

105
00:08:42,777 --> 00:08:44,695
However, it's still a pity.

106
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:47,532
I wanted to face off against you
in your top condition.

107
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,908
You're bringing this up again.

108
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,577
It's been several months.

109
00:08:55,081 --> 00:08:56,749
An urgent call-up?

110
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,461
Low-rank hunters are
just fated to run errands.

111
00:09:01,045 --> 00:09:03,673
Master, have you never
thought about retiring?

112
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:04,840
{\an8}Retiring?

113
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:11,013
Indeed.

114
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:15,184
An old man with only one arm
might only be a hindrance.

115
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:17,186
No, that's not what I meant…

116
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,606
I lost an arm, yet I survived.

117
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,109
I don't have much time left.

118
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:26,779
At least before I die,
I hope to do more for this world.

119
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,123
{\an8}I got a new raid mission.

120
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,001
Dear.

121
00:09:40,793 --> 00:09:43,713
Isn't it about time
you give up being a hunter?

122
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:45,715
You bring it up again?

123
00:09:46,215 --> 00:09:47,842
Because it's too dangerous.

124
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:50,136
So many people died in the last mission.

125
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:53,514
You almost didn't make it out, right?

126
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:56,225
Hmm… Yeah.

127
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,853
Daddy, hug.

128
00:10:01,272 --> 00:10:04,108
But, next year,
Eunji will be going to kindergarten,

129
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:05,693
and Eunha is also going to junior high.

130
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:07,278
We need money, don't we?

131
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:08,654
That's true, but still…

132
00:10:08,738 --> 00:10:10,323
It's okay.

133
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:14,619
The association wouldn't send us low-rank
hunters to overly dangerous dungeons.

134
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:18,164
{\an8}Last time was just an exception.

135
00:10:18,664 --> 00:10:20,166
Yes.

136
00:10:20,249 --> 00:10:22,376
Sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

137
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,669
Don't mind it.

138
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:25,880
Be careful, okay?

139
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:27,548
Okay.

140
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:28,466
I love you.

141
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:29,800
Daddy.

142
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:31,218
Oh, what is it?

143
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:33,971
Daddy, are you very powerful?

144
00:10:34,055 --> 00:10:35,765
Of course.

145
00:10:35,848 --> 00:10:39,018
I can defeat scary monsters.

146
00:10:39,101 --> 00:10:40,436
That's amazing.

147
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,980
Daddy, you really are the best.

148
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:46,233
You tricked me.

149
00:10:49,195 --> 00:10:50,613
{\an8}What are you referring to?

150
00:10:51,113 --> 00:10:54,617
You pushed the bothersome
media interview onto me.

151
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,785
I saw it on TV.

152
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:58,037
You did super well.

153
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,539
Your speech really hit home.

154
00:11:00,623 --> 00:11:02,500
Stop saying that.

155
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:06,212
That was originally your job, right?

156
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:08,839
But President Go requested

157
00:11:08,923 --> 00:11:14,804
to show the public the work attitude
and honest character of strong hunters.

158
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:18,182
I don't think
I'm quite suited for this task.

159
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:21,143
So you know you're not honest.

160
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:23,938
Forget it.

161
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:25,689
All right, what do you want from me?

162
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,611
You didn't summon me
just to hear me complain, right?

163
00:11:30,694 --> 00:11:35,533
I must inform you of a recent event.

164
00:11:36,492 --> 00:11:39,870
Yoojin Construction
seems to want to establish a guild.

165
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:42,915
I know that. They are looking
for people under the table.

166
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:45,668
I've also heard
they are poaching my people.

167
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,589
Since you have known it,
it seems I am meddling unnecessarily.

168
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:54,218
You knew all along that I would know.

169
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:55,678
Stop beating around the bush.

170
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,639
I'll ask you again.

171
00:11:59,598 --> 00:12:00,975
What do you want from me?

172
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,356
<i>You haven't been calling recently.</i>

173
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,024
<i>Is everything going well?</i>

174
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,944
-Hmm.
<i>-How's your work?</i>

175
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:13,904
Hmm.

176
00:12:13,988 --> 00:12:15,072
It's okay.

177
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:18,033
<i>You have always been timid.</i>

178
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:20,578
<i>Doesn't working as a hunter
make you uncomfortable?</i>

179
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:22,329
<i>I heard you're a B-rank hunter.</i>

180
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,583
<i>If it were someone else,
they would probably be strong.</i>

181
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,586
<i>But you'd probably be a burden to others.</i>

182
00:12:29,086 --> 00:12:31,380
<i>You'd better come back
and help out at home.</i>

183
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:32,590
<i>Your dad is also worried--</i>

184
00:12:32,673 --> 00:12:34,592
Don't make decisions for me, okay?

185
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:38,012
{\an8}I'll make my own decisions.
I don't need you to interfere.

186
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:39,597
<i>Wait, why are you--</i>

187
00:12:47,062 --> 00:12:48,564
A burden to others?

188
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:51,525
But…

189
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:58,365
I'll just give it another go.

190
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:31,315
Excuse me.

191
00:13:33,484 --> 00:13:36,111
What is it, Hunter Cha Hae-In?

192
00:13:36,695 --> 00:13:40,866
Someone from Yoojin Construction
tried to poach me during my training.

193
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,576
I came to report to you.

194
00:13:43,619 --> 00:13:44,537
I see.

195
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,706
{\an8}<i>It seems they want
to establish a new guild</i>

196
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,960
<i>and want me to be the guild master.</i>

197
00:13:52,044 --> 00:13:53,337
You've come to report to me.

198
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,966
Can I take it as
you've declined their offer?

199
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:59,426
Yes. I declined right on the spot.

200
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:01,637
I'm relieved.

201
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,097
Thank you very much.

202
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,181
It's nothing.

203
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:05,432
By the way,

204
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:09,186
I saw Mr. Baek on my way here.

205
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,480
What did he come to talk to you about?

206
00:14:20,364 --> 00:14:24,285
<i>What are your thoughts on Jeju Island?</i>

207
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:26,370
Jeju Island?

208
00:14:26,954 --> 00:14:28,497
Why do you ask that?

209
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:32,960
After the third raid mission,
the island was ordered off-limits.

210
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:36,380
Now, there are only periodic
patrols along the coast.

211
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:40,467
And the public only sees
the annual memorial service.

212
00:14:41,135 --> 00:14:45,389
People have forgotten the island
along with the fear.

213
00:14:45,931 --> 00:14:48,392
But that's unavoidable, isn't it?

214
00:14:48,475 --> 00:14:49,768
However,

215
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:53,397
whether the gates
have become part of daily life,

216
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,442
or I'm hailed
as the Ultimate Weapon of Mankind,

217
00:14:56,525 --> 00:15:00,487
I will not forget that island,
nor what happened there.

218
00:15:01,488 --> 00:15:03,407
In the near future,

219
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,743
I will definitely conquer that island.

220
00:15:06,577 --> 00:15:07,620
For that reason,

221
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:10,289
we cannot afford to be divided now.

222
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:13,500
We must unite, increase our numbers,

223
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:15,836
and sway public opinion.

224
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,256
That's what those interviews
and nurturing of newcomers are for?

225
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:28,849
Aren't you the same?

226
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:32,561
<i>You have also left something behind
on that island.</i>

227
00:15:39,944 --> 00:15:40,861
Eunseok.

228
00:15:41,904 --> 00:15:42,863
Byung-gu.

229
00:15:47,576 --> 00:15:48,410
Please.

230
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:50,204
Help me…

231
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:53,624
kill them.

232
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,586
I'm going out.

233
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,922
Still working on the holiday?

234
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,008
You've been doing this often lately.

235
00:16:04,635 --> 00:16:05,552
Yes.

236
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:10,182
You used to get hurt
every time you went through the gate.

237
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:11,976
Is this the result of exercise?

238
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:13,394
Perhaps.

239
00:16:13,978 --> 00:16:18,148
{\an8}Anyway, I can earn money steadily now.
Isn't that a good thing?

240
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:20,067
It is…

241
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:22,611
Eh, Brother? Don't you need luggage?

242
00:16:23,237 --> 00:16:25,322
No need. I'm heading out.

243
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:26,699
Eh, wait.

244
00:16:30,077 --> 00:16:32,246
It's not like going
to the convenience store.

245
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:39,336
<i>My awakening is not
a physical type of awakening.</i>

246
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,380
<i>My swordsmanship
can't harm the magic beasts.</i>

247
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:43,757
<i>The swordsmanship
that I've practiced for decades</i>

248
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:46,093
<i>turns out to be useless in the dungeon.</i>

249
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:51,098
{\an8}<i>The fact that I, a swordsman, awakened
as a mage is also a twist of fate.</i>

250
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:53,934
{\an8}<i>Could there be some reason behind it?</i>

251
00:16:57,771 --> 00:16:58,605
You are…

252
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:00,232
Mr. Song.

253
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:02,401
I was wondering if I was mistaken.

254
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:03,777
Are you Sung?

255
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:05,404
Long time no see.

256
00:17:05,988 --> 00:17:08,240
I never thought that
I would see you here again.

257
00:17:08,323 --> 00:17:10,075
That being said,

258
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:12,828
where is that immature young man?

259
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:15,497
In just a few months,
you've changed so much.

260
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:17,958
And…

261
00:17:18,042 --> 00:17:20,419
How come your leg is fine?

262
00:17:20,502 --> 00:17:24,381
Well… When I woke up in the hospital,
my leg was back to normal.

263
00:17:24,882 --> 00:17:26,300
I see.

264
00:17:26,383 --> 00:17:30,929
There might be a high-level healer
among the hunters who came to rescue.

265
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:33,098
Regardless,

266
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:35,976
it's great to see a young talent
making a recovery.

267
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,561
Thank you.

268
00:17:38,187 --> 00:17:39,688
But you…

269
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,648
As for me,

270
00:17:41,732 --> 00:17:44,777
I didn't get it treated soon enough.

271
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:45,986
But it's all right.

272
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:47,905
What's more important is,

273
00:17:47,988 --> 00:17:50,574
I heard from the association staff
that you are all right,

274
00:17:50,657 --> 00:17:52,868
but I'm glad to be able
to see you like this again.

275
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:54,745
Mr. Song, why did you come here?

276
00:17:55,245 --> 00:17:58,415
I was summoned by the association.
I heard that it's a D-rank mission.

277
00:17:58,499 --> 00:17:59,875
You are in it too?

278
00:18:13,764 --> 00:18:15,057
I can't believe this.

279
00:18:16,183 --> 00:18:18,393
The members from that mission.

280
00:18:21,063 --> 00:18:22,314
Jinwoo.

281
00:18:22,898 --> 00:18:23,774
Joohee.

282
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:26,485
And

283
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:28,070
Mr. Kim and Mr. Kang.

284
00:18:29,863 --> 00:18:30,989
<i>So be it.</i>

285
00:18:31,615 --> 00:18:35,828
<i>After all, we abandoned Sung
and fled that place.</i>

286
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,123
<i>Kim even drew his sword against me.</i>

287
00:18:39,206 --> 00:18:42,000
<i>I suppose he is too ashamed to face us.</i>

288
00:18:42,084 --> 00:18:43,377
<i>But…</i>

289
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,214
<i>The five survivors of that tragedy
are once again together.</i>

290
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:48,215
<i>So…</i>

291
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,842
Jinwoo.

292
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:51,260
It's you, right?

293
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,387
You've changed a lot.

294
00:18:53,971 --> 00:18:55,889
Yes. It's been a long time.

295
00:18:55,973 --> 00:18:57,975
You've grown much taller.

296
00:18:58,058 --> 00:18:59,017
And your leg.

297
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,728
When I came to visit, you were already…

298
00:19:01,812 --> 00:19:03,021
Visit?

299
00:19:08,527 --> 00:19:09,778
Oh.

300
00:19:09,862 --> 00:19:12,990
There's a beautiful lady here too.

301
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:16,451
What's the matter?

302
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:18,912
Are you with that young man?

303
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:20,914
{\an8}Why don't you come to us--

304
00:19:20,998 --> 00:19:22,374
{\an8}Shut up.

305
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:26,712
You are not here for a hike.

306
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:33,468
Now, I will explain
to all the general hunters.

307
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:34,595
Please come this way.

308
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:36,555
What's going on?

309
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:41,143
They are the substitute prisoners
who will join you on the mission today.

310
00:19:41,226 --> 00:19:42,811
Substitute prisoners?

311
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:45,272
We have to go on a mission with criminals?

312
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:47,274
Although they are hunters
with convictions,

313
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:50,444
they wish to lessen their sentences,
so they will not harm you.

314
00:19:50,944 --> 00:19:54,156
There is a shortage
of manpower in this area.

315
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,199
Please bear with us.

316
00:19:55,949 --> 00:19:57,576
How can this be?

317
00:19:58,202 --> 00:20:02,122
Kang Taeshik from Hunter's Association's
Surveillance Team will accompany you.

318
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,707
He is a B-rank hunter.

319
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:09,338
Even in the event of danger, he can
easily deal with three C-rank prisoners.

320
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:11,006
So please rest assured.

321
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,674
Something feels wrong.

322
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:15,093
Joohee, you shouldn't go.

323
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:16,720
What about you?

324
00:20:17,596 --> 00:20:18,680
I'm going.

325
00:20:22,226 --> 00:20:23,852
Then I'm going too.

326
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:26,980
I understand.

327
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:31,568
Ah, the taste of freedom is wonderful.

328
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:33,737
We are not slaves.

329
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,530
Do you have to treat us this way?

330
00:20:35,614 --> 00:20:36,740
Shut up.

331
00:20:36,823 --> 00:20:38,075
You are prisoners.

332
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:42,204
If you dare to make a reckless move,
you know what will happen to you.

333
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:49,253
I'm Kang Taeshik from the Hunter's
Association's Surveillance Team.

334
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:53,465
I will take responsibility
for monitoring them.

335
00:20:53,548 --> 00:20:54,591
Please be assured.

336
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:58,720
Who will be the leader
of this raid mission?

337
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,433
Sung, can I be the captain?

338
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:04,643
Yes, of course.

339
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:08,605
Thank you for giving me another chance.

340
00:21:08,689 --> 00:21:10,065
Mr. Song.

341
00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:13,777
That day, due to my mistake,
seven people lost their lives.

342
00:21:14,444 --> 00:21:16,780
I am to blame
for not being able to protect them.

343
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:20,575
But, thanks to you, six people survived.

344
00:21:21,201 --> 00:21:23,745
Please allow me to thank you
on behalf of the five of them.

345
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:26,164
{\an8}I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

346
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,584
Mr. Song. Please raise your head.

347
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:35,424
Kim, are you okay with me
being the captain?

348
00:21:38,093 --> 00:21:39,511
Whatever.

349
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,061
{\an8}That's it then.

350
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:50,772
{\an8}I'll lead the team in the dungeon.

351
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:52,149
Understood.

352
00:21:52,232 --> 00:21:53,275
Then let's set off.

353
00:22:01,408 --> 00:22:03,035
{\an8}So, let's go

354
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:05,495
into the dungeon.
