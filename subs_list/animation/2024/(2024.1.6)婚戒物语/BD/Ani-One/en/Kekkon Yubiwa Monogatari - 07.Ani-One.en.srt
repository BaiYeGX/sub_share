1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,125
We're here, Nephrites.

2
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:11,375
Wait for me!

3
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:16,042
This place is said to be
at the edge of the world.

4
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:17,958
It's surprisingly bustling.

5
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,917
The Kingdom of Water, Maasa.

6
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:21,417
It may be at the border,

7
00:00:21,417 --> 00:00:23,708
but this is the most thriving city.

8
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:26,458
By the way, where is Marse?

9
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:29,250
He had something to tend to

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,292
and went on ahead.

11
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:32,375
I see.

12
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,292
He's always wanted to come here.

13
00:00:35,292 --> 00:00:37,292
There must be a reason for that.

14
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:41,875
Excuse me!

15
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:49,042
You must be the Ring King, right?

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:51,583
Yes.

17
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,708
Wonderful!

18
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:55,083
I'm your biggest fan!

19
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,208
Hey, you're embarrassing me.

20
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,500
You're quite popular here.

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,000
As expected from my husband.

22
00:01:01,417 --> 00:01:03,500
Oh, right. Please accept this bouquet.

23
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:06,458
And this too.

24
00:01:30,292 --> 00:01:32,792
I heard rumours about you,

25
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,750
but you're such a careless fool!

26
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,083
Ring King!

27
00:01:38,083 --> 00:01:38,792
Huh...

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,042
My name is Saphir Maasa.

29
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,375
The Ring Princess of Water.

30
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:50,000
From now on, you are my husband.

31
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,083
Is this even allowed?

32
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,250
Yeah.

33
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:12,000
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

34
00:03:25,542 --> 00:03:29,000
Thank you for aiding us,

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,833
Ring Princess of Water.

36
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,083
Don't mention it.

37
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:36,125
You seem pretty calm, Great Sage.

38
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,375
As for the others...

39
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:40,875
Oh...

40
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,958
I've met the other princesses,
so that's enough.

41
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,667
We're not going to be best friends anyway.

42
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,958
Now, Ring King,

43
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,833
I've made you my husband.

44
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,208
That makes you the king of this country.

45
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:58,208
I knew it.

46
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:01,542
It's your duty and responsibility
to bring stability to this country.

47
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,333
Get ready.

48
00:04:04,292 --> 00:04:05,542
Yes.

49
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:07,208
Come with me.

50
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:11,833
Unleash your true potential for me.

51
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,917
My full potential?

52
00:04:13,917 --> 00:04:15,208
What's going on here?

53
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,000
At this rate,
the country is going to be destroyed.

54
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:24,875
Here you are,

55
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,167
Princess Saphir.

56
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,250
Please return to the palace.

57
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:33,833
This is the Ring King.

58
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,042
I just made him my husband

59
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:38,917
and gave him Maasa's Ring of Water.

60
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:41,167
Will there be a problem?

61
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,958
Understood.

62
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,917
Please follow us to the palace.

63
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,292
That is huge!

64
00:04:53,292 --> 00:04:56,375
The great waterfall El-Wuyo Massa.

65
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:00,250
An iconic landmark of this country.

66
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:05,583
The old Kingdom of Earth
is just past that waterfall.

67
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:09,792
It's also known as the Dark Domain,
where the Abyss King resides.

68
00:05:11,792 --> 00:05:12,958
Look.

69
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:17,375
The empire's soldiers are everywhere.

70
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,875
Maasa no long has an army.

71
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:23,292
The empire...
Isn't that Mr. Marse's country?

72
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:25,333
You actually remember.

73
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,875
Of course I remember.

74
00:05:27,417 --> 00:05:29,292
The largest country
ever founded by the human race,

75
00:05:29,292 --> 00:05:30,875
the Gisaras Empire,

76
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,750
is joining hands with many countries

77
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,875
to expand its territory.

78
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:37,542
Was the old man from earlier...

79
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,833
The First Prince of Gisaras,

80
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,500
Marse's older brother.

81
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,250
The Undefeated General,
Prince Sluder Gisaras.

82
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,417
He's the one in charge of
executing the emperor's orders.

83
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,500
We got away for being
one of the Ring Kingdoms,

84
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,333
but he is the conqueror
who has seized many countries.

85
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,958
Is the empire actually the bad guy?

86
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,667
Isn't that obvious?

87
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,958
This is command and invade.

88
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,250
They claim it was to protect us
from the Abyssal Creatures,

89
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,583
but that was just an excuse.

90
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,000
Some share that idea,

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,458
but it's the truth
that they united everyone

92
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,417
to prevent the resurrection
of the Abyss King.

93
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:21,708
You're very knowledgeable.

94
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:23,292
Are you impressed?

95
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:25,542
What can a beast possibly know?

96
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,042
Cursed woman...

97
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:31,667
I'm going to crush you
and mix your remains with the cat powder!

98
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,708
This must be the palace.

99
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,375
What was that?

100
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:46,417
Monsters are attacking.

101
00:06:46,417 --> 00:06:48,750
Another prediction came true.

102
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,167
Aren't you worried?

103
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:53,083
The empire's soldiers are here
to defend us.

104
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,000
Satou, watch out!

105
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:01,167
Wha...

106
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,458
Impossible!

107
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,875
How can it be here?

108
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:09,375
Ring King!

109
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,083
That was too close.

110
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,958
That's the power of the rings...

111
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,042
-Thank goodness you're all right.
-Ring King Satou.

112
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:35,417
-We managed to stay alive.
-If he...

113
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,042
I expected nothing less from my husband.

114
00:07:40,208 --> 00:07:43,417
The legends aren't just fairy tales.

115
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,583
So, this is the Ring King.

116
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,125
Yes, Father.

117
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:55,375
He is now my husband.

118
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,167
The Ring of Water is his now.

119
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,167
Hold on.

120
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:01,167
It seemed you wanted to keep me here

121
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:04,708
so I couldn't hand over the ring.

122
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:08,333
I thwarted your plan.

123
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,125
Keeping you here?

124
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:12,875
What are you talking about?

125
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,375
Cursed vixen.

126
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:20,000
The army of monsters is approaching.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,083
Please don't act on your own.

128
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,083
Things just got a lot more complicated.

129
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:26,917
Right?

130
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,167
As you predicted,

131
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:34,542
the Ring King now has the ring!

132
00:08:34,542 --> 00:08:39,250
That means my kingdom will face
an even greater calamity!

133
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,667
Ring King!

134
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:44,292
Why did you have to come here?

135
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,333
How is it my fault?

136
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:58,542
Oh my, we wouldn't want your body
to take a toll.

137
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,708
Let's move you somewhere
so you can rest.

138
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,875
Curse you, Ring King!

139
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:08,000
Is that sketchy woman your mother, Saphir?

140
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,042
Does it look that way?

141
00:09:10,042 --> 00:09:13,125
She is a seer the palace has hired.

142
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,667
At some point,

143
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,000
my father grew very dependent on her

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,500
and became the husk he is now.

145
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:22,083
To think my father was once
known as the Virtuous King.

146
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:28,833
Big Sister!

147
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,250
Why?

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,583
We swore we'd decide

149
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:36,917
who should be the Ring Princess together!

150
00:09:36,917 --> 00:09:40,292
Sorry, but I've made the decision.

151
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,542
How could you?

152
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,208
She just called you big sister.

153
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,417
Yeah.

154
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:49,792
She is my twin sister,

155
00:09:49,792 --> 00:09:51,208
Saphira.

156
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:53,250
A twin princess?

157
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,375
Why did you do it, Saphir?

158
00:09:58,167 --> 00:09:59,125
Why?

159
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,750
Why did you marry
that mediocre-looking guy?

160
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,042
Ouch...

161
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:08,167
You could've married someone better.

162
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,708
Did you do it for me?

163
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:12,875
How cruel!

164
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:16,042
Destiny has been so cruel to us!

165
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:18,375
Excuse me, Princess Saphira,

166
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:22,333
Satou managed to defeat me in combat.

167
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:28,292
Well, he's not particularly reliable
when it comes to a fight.

168
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,458
You are supposed to defend me!

169
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,833
So...

170
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,375
I'm an elf, so I don't really understand
humans' standards for beauty.

171
00:10:35,375 --> 00:10:37,458
I'd rather not make any comment.

172
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,333
Not you too, Nephrites...

173
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,583
Satou...

174
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,458
Satou...

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,208
Satou is really cool!

176
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,750
Thank you, Hime!

177
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,083
Whatever.

178
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,292
She wasn't listening.

179
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,042
You don't have to marry
the Ring King now.

180
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,583
It's no longer your concern.

181
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,708
Sister...

182
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,667
Princess Saphira!

183
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:13,250
What is it?
The atmosphere got too tense.

184
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:16,292
I know everything I say at this point

185
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:17,667
will sound like an excuse to you,

186
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,083
but I've never forgotten our promise.

187
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,667
I don't want to hear

188
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,417
your voice any more.

189
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,958
Princess Saphira!

190
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:38,625
You're still as worthless as ever, Marse.

191
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,417
Mr. Marse has always

192
00:11:44,417 --> 00:11:47,000
wanted to come here.

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,375
Could it be...

194
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:52,667
That man was Saphira's lover.

195
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:54,333
ROMANCE!?

196
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:57,292
Did you know nothing?

197
00:11:57,292 --> 00:12:00,167
It does seem like something he'd do.

198
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:03,833
I'll tell you the story

199
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,917
about Maasa and their empire,

200
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:09,708
the Gisaras Empire.

201
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,042
In the past, the Gisaras Empire

202
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:18,833
wasn't satisfied with conquering
the lands of humans.

203
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,083
They went as far as

204
00:12:20,083 --> 00:12:23,792
invading the Kingdom of Water, Maasa.

205
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:27,250
But no battle ever broke out.

206
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,833
The empire knew
it couldn't take Maasa by force,

207
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,792
so it hoped to strengthen
the diplomatic ties.

208
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,000
I am the Second Prince
of the Gisaras Empire,

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,542
Marmarugias Gisaras.

210
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:41,083
We'd like to learn from Maasa,
which has a long-standing history,

211
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,042
and improve
the relationship between our countries.

212
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:55,375
They soon became very close.

213
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:02,583
There was no doubt
that they loved each other.

214
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,375
Or at least I thought so.

215
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,625
Even if Marse had an unspeakable mission.

216
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,167
Please take me!

217
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,458
Marse's mission

218
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:18,917
was to deliver confidential information
about Maasa to the empire.

219
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:20,500
Please wait for me.

220
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:24,333
However, he never did it.

221
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,958
I'll come for you someday.

222
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,292
Prince Marse.

223
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,875
I believe you.

224
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:37,583
The empire always deals with
those who can't fulfil their missions.

225
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:40,826
Marse was summoned back to the empire.

226
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:43,458
Several months later...

227
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,667
I will become the Ring King,
as per the emperor's order.

228
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:51,333
Then, I can finally marry you.

229
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,792
Despite it being a twisted marriage
to fulfil the Ring King's duty,

230
00:13:57,792 --> 00:14:01,208
she had the chance
to marry the one she loved.

231
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,833
We were born to become Ring Princesses.

232
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:09,250
That was a fate too luxurious
to even think about.

233
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,875
In the end,

234
00:14:12,417 --> 00:14:15,417
Prince Marse gave up
on becoming the Ring King.

235
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:21,042
He let a stranger from another world

236
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:22,792
take the ring.

237
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:27,583
He broke his promise to Saphira.

238
00:14:29,917 --> 00:14:31,000
Princess Saphira!

239
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,375
Please hear me out!

240
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:36,708
My love for you has never changed!

241
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,750
I've always loved you!

242
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:42,667
So why?

243
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,917
Why didn't you become the Ring King?

244
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,583
That's because...

245
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,417
I didn't think

246
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,917
I was worthy.

247
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:02,250
I can't understand
what's going on in your mind.

248
00:15:10,792 --> 00:15:15,250
The seer showed up afterwards.

249
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,625
At first, no one believed her.

250
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:23,750
Not until her prediction came true.

251
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,125
To fend off the monsters,

252
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,542
the seer's predictions will come in handy.

253
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:33,208
So, Father kept her here.

254
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,667
That was how he became
the way he is now.

255
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:40,333
Do you think the seer
was sent here by the empire?

256
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,917
There must be a connection between them.

257
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:44,875
It's exactly why I want to

258
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,000
catch that vixen
and expose her true nature.

259
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,333
Cursed Saphir.

260
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,750
She ruined my plan.

261
00:15:55,292 --> 00:15:58,542
Kill the Ring King
and get the rings.

262
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:01,250
For the glory of our great king!

263
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,167
Yes!

264
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,292
Now I envy him.

265
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,875
No, this is indecent.

266
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,917
Hold on. One of them is missing.

267
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:20,958
The catfolk woman...

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,875
An attack while everyone is fast asleep.

269
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,083
The Ring Princess of Water
was right, after all.

270
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,417
No horns.

271
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,333
Are these normal humans?

272
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,375
I knew it. The empire sent them.

273
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,583
Assassins?

274
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,625
Correct.

275
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:53,375
So, it was real.

276
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,083
By the way, where are we headed now?

277
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:13,583
To get basked in sunlight.

278
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:20,792
The dragon-kins
can't regulate their body temperature.

279
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:21,917
They become slow

280
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:25,125
when the body temperature drops.

281
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,833
I see.

282
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,833
That's why she came here
right after waking up.

283
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,417
She's trying to warm her body.

284
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:35,458
When the temperature gets too high,
they cool down with water.

285
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,250
Aren't you going to join them, Granart?

286
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,500
I'll take a pass today.

287
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,833
More importantly,

288
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:46,333
I said you were unreliable as a warrior,

289
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:48,208
but you have a good figure.

290
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:51,417
It makes me want to have
a baby with you, Satou.

291
00:17:52,042 --> 00:17:54,458
Well? How about we do it tonight?

292
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,042
No, wait...

293
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:57,417
You can't be the first...

294
00:17:57,417 --> 00:18:00,292
That's Princess Krystal's
wishful thinking.

295
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:02,208
Hey! What are you doing there?

296
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:05,125
I should be the first.

297
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,083
Your waiting love is too weak.

298
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,792
My love for Satou is very passionate.

299
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,917
I don't mind getting in the line.

300
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,167
Hold on!

301
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,833
A bunch of fools!

302
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:28,833
"TIGHT"
Saphir, that swimsuit...

303
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:31,000
This is my backyard.

304
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,458
I usually walk around naked.

305
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,333
I only put this on because of you.

306
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,042
By the way, if you're so concerned about

307
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:39,250
who gets to do it first,

308
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:41,875
why not have a contest?

309
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:42,917
For example,

310
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:46,792
the first to swim over there wins.

311
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,750
Huh?

312
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,583
Meow.

313
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:52,583
Are you afraid of water?

314
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,042
Eat this!

315
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:57,292
-A bunch of utter fools.
-Get this!

316
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:58,917
-A bunch of utter fools.
-Stop! I hate water!

317
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:00,833
Erm, I want to...

318
00:19:02,208 --> 00:19:04,167
By the way, Satou,

319
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:07,125
the seer hasn't given up her plan yet.

320
00:19:07,792 --> 00:19:10,042
Stay vigilant even if you're pretending

321
00:19:10,042 --> 00:19:12,167
to let your guard down.

322
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,083
Wait, this is just an act?

323
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:17,625
A great opportunity to expose that seer.

324
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,042
Do not miss it.

325
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,292
Mr. Marse.

326
00:19:30,917 --> 00:19:33,750
You're in a pretty tough position.

327
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,042
I can say the same to you.

328
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,250
It's somewhat my fault that Maasa became

329
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,250
the way it is now.

330
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:43,583
I feel like I've failed them.

331
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,667
Why did you let me become the Ring King?

332
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,208
If you hadn't,

333
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,167
you could've married Princess Saphira.

334
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,792
It was a burden that was too heavy for me.

335
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,917
That's all.

336
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,875
Is that all?

337
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:06,917
If you have a reason
to become the Ring King,

338
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:09,208
you can take the rings for yourself.

339
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,083
She reminded me of her.

340
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,458
The look on Princess Krystal's face
reminded me of Saphira.

341
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,417
She was reunited with her lover.

342
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,583
Knowing how she felt,

343
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,333
I couldn't let myself get in the way.

344
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,417
It's my flaw

345
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,500
for not taking what I want
by any means necessary.

346
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:37,667
I don't blame Father
for calling me worthless.

347
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:42,833
But you abandoned everything
for Princess Krystal's sake.

348
00:20:44,042 --> 00:20:46,417
You are more worthy
of becoming the Ring King

349
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:48,375
than I am.

350
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,667
Brother!

351
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,375
Please reconsider!

352
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,958
We agreed not to intervene in Maasa.

353
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:04,167
It's Father's order
to send reinforcements here.

354
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:06,292
You haven't been forgiven

355
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:08,292
for going against the order
and not becoming the Ring King.

356
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:11,250
But you've done your part
to earn the Ring King's trust.

357
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,833
We know their plan.

358
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,958
Father considers that your redemption.

359
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,042
You must answer
Father's expectations, Marse.

360
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,625
The Gisaras Empire is the only place

361
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,458
you can return to.

362
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,625
What do you want?

363
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:46,417
Take the ring, Prince Marse.

364
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:47,625
Don't be ridiculous.

365
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:51,250
That is the emperor's order!

366
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,333
You've earned the Ring King's trust

367
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,458
for this very purpose.

368
00:21:57,208 --> 00:22:01,583
Three days from now,
an army of monsters will attack Maasa.
