1
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:04,125
Honey, you're back.

2
00:00:04,958 --> 00:00:06,583
Do you want to take a shower,

3
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:08,750
have your dinner,

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:13,417
or have me instead?

5
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,583
I'm going to devour you whole right now.

6
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:25,750
Naughty Satou, you're so pervy.

7
00:00:35,542 --> 00:00:36,792
What?

8
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:37,917
"HUH?"
Hold on...

9
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:41,333
Nephrites, let's begin.

10
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,625
Yes, Lord Satou.

11
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,625
Wait! I'm supposed to be lying there!

12
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:49,792
No!

13
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,375
Oh my, that was just a dream.

14
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:00,583
Here you go.

15
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,042
It's hot, don't burn yourself.

16
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:03,792
Yes.

17
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:07,208
Hime, you're finally awake.

18
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:08,625
Dinner is ready.

19
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,375
Yeah.

20
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,583
Get as much rest as possible.

21
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:17,792
Which kingdom should we head to now?

22
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:20,458
The Kingdom of Water,

23
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,458
the dragonkin's nation.

24
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,708
Great.

25
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,917
I've always wanted to visit that place.

26
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:27,083
Ouch!

27
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,042
Are you all right?

28
00:01:28,042 --> 00:01:30,167
It's still too hot.

29
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:34,500
Come to think about it,

30
00:01:35,292 --> 00:01:37,042
Satou has been spending

31
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:39,583
a lot of time with Nephrites.

32
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:45,625
Satou, where is mine?

33
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:48,083
Sorry, Hime.
You can help yourself with it.

34
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:48,917
Wh...

35
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:52,500
People normally wouldn't go that far!

36
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,625
Hime?

37
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:58,292
Forget what I said!

38
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:00,792
Hime!

39
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:06,125
What is that sound?

40
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:15,167
What is this thing?

41
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:19,667
A moving city?

42
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:23,000
Today is our lucky day.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,083
I never expected to see it here.

44
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:30,000
Behold, the Kingdom of Fire, Needakitta.

45
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:34,125
This is the giant moving city
of the catfolk knights.

46
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:52,958
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

47
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:11,167
It's actually a country?

48
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,458
I was wondering where to find them.

49
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:17,542
We can't miss this opportunity.

50
00:04:17,542 --> 00:04:20,833
Let's go to the princess
and get the Ring of Fire.

51
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,917
We can head for
the Kingdom of Water afterwards.

52
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:26,208
I see.

53
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,125
Why is he so eager to go
to the Kingdom of Water?

54
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,875
Does he have closed ones there?

55
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,458
How do we get inside?

56
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,500
Leave that to me.

57
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,792
Hey there! Can we get in there?

58
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:48,958
A ladder?

59
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,250
Time to go up.

60
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,542
The air is too dusty.

61
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:00,500
"SHAKING"
Nephrites!

62
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,250
I think this is where I bid you farewell.

63
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,917
It's been a fun journey.

64
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,208
She suddenly gave up!

65
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:10,083
Get it together, Nephrites!

66
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:10,708
I will...

67
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,083
Satou!

68
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:15,083
"HOLDING TIGHTLY"
I can take care of Nephrites!

69
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,792
Okay.

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,875
Keep it up.

71
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,333
Hyah!

72
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,792
Hey! What are you staring at?

73
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,000
Hey! Be careful!

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,208
Please be careful.

75
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:37,583
It'd be game over if you fell.

76
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,792
Nephrites.

77
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:45,458
You've done well.

78
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,208
I'm exhausted.

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,958
This is the order of knights?

80
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:02,167
It looks like a market street
in every aspect.

81
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:05,958
Needakitta consists
of the Order of Knights of Fire,

82
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,500
which consists of the strong catfolks.

83
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,792
Merchants will travel with them
to seek protection.

84
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:13,917
Before they knew it,
it's become a massive caravan.

85
00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,958
It's just the same as the books!

86
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,500
You are very knowledgeable.

87
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,917
It's said the catfolks lost their land
in the earliest era of the Ring King.

88
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,333
They ended up
building a city on moving platforms,

89
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:30,458
slowly becoming a travelling tribe
that offered armed services.

90
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:33,292
Perhaps it's more befitting
to call them mercenaries.

91
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:36,667
But the strongest order of knights

92
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:40,667
has become the safest travelling caravan.

93
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,250
The Kingdom of Fire brings
merchandise from different countries

94
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,667
wherever they end up going.

95
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:49,958
All right,

96
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:54,958
let's ask them to take us
to the Ring Princess of Fire.

97
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,250
Huh? The two are gone.

98
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:01,542
Incredible!

99
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,417
Simply incredible!

100
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,417
A trove of rare books!

101
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:13,042
These are Imma'unia
from the Memorandum of Dusk!

102
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,458
Lord Satou, look at these!

103
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,208
This is...

104
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:18,375
Huh?

105
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,750
I think we got separated.

106
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,875
Is it a bad thing?

107
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,917
NOISES

108
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,208
What... What do we do now?

109
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:30,208
There are strangers everywhere!

110
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:33,333
Ewww... I feel sick.

111
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,208
Sorry.

112
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,667
I kept causing you more trouble.

113
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,500
It's all right. I don't mind that.

114
00:07:42,542 --> 00:07:45,042
Hey, are they the catfolks?

115
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:48,375
Yes. Their looks fit
the descriptions from my books.

116
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,167
They are so cute with those cat ears.

117
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:52,667
Not cute at all!

118
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:56,042
The ancient warrior blood
flows in their veins.

119
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:00,333
They are a tribe of savages that served
the Ring King with violence.

120
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,958
That's what the book says.

121
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:05,750
Besides, the elves' ears are cuter.

122
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,750
See how long they are?

123
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,750
Well...

124
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,167
You two over there.

125
00:08:11,167 --> 00:08:13,500
Are you lost?

126
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,458
Yes.

127
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:18,083
We got separated from our friends.

128
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,333
I see.

129
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,042
When you are lost in Needakitta,

130
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,167
simply walk towards the arena.

131
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:25,042
It's the most conspicuous landmark around.

132
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,958
Thank... Thank you so much!

133
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,833
I hope you find your friends.

134
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:34,042
They are different from the books.

135
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,125
Where did you go, Hime

136
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,750
and Nephrites?

137
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,375
Calm down, Satou.

138
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:45,500
Needakitta is a very safe place.

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,542
There is only one place we should be,

140
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:49,500
which is
where the Ring Princess of Fire is.

141
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,667
I'm so worried...

142
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:56,417
Everyone has been staring at us.

143
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,333
Are you sure we are safe here?

144
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,125
The catfolks have great respect
for the strong.

145
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,958
I see.

146
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,375
It's the imposing aura I'm giving off.

147
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,667
Sorry, but I am already in love.

148
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:12,708
Hi there!

149
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,708
Judging by your poise and figure,

150
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,875
you must be a famous swordsman!

151
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,667
Would you like to join us for some tea?

152
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:24,917
Don't judge a book by its cover.

153
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:27,792
The man over there
is much stronger than me.

154
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,625
Oh my, I like your sense of humour.

155
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,333
"OUCH"
That's hurtful.

156
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:34,000
He barely has any muscles on him.

157
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,292
By the way,

158
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:40,333
we are here to have an audience
with the princess.

159
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,292
Do you know where she is?

160
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,125
Another one of her admirers?

161
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:48,583
I get it.

162
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,500
You must have come here
to have a blind date with her.

163
00:09:52,542 --> 00:09:53,875
A blind date?

164
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,375
This must be the arena.

165
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:03,417
Here you go.

166
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,917
Thank you.

167
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:08,250
This is loaded with Imma'unia.

168
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,792
This looks so yummy.

169
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,292
I find it a bit gross.

170
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,500
This tastes heavenly.

171
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,250
A lot sweeter than I thought.

172
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,583
You got a smudge on your face.

173
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,500
Come on.

174
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:28,167
Princess Krystal,
you act just like Lord Satou.

175
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:29,750
How so?

176
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,125
You are both very kind.

177
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:34,875
Travelling with you

178
00:10:34,875 --> 00:10:38,208
reminds me of having
my parents' protection.

179
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,708
"DAD, MUM, DAUGHTER"
I'm like a mother to you?

180
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,875
Hold on, you're much older than me!

181
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,625
It's too weird for me
to have a daughter like you!

182
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:52,000
It's nothing.

183
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:57,375
I've always wanted to apologise to you.

184
00:10:57,917 --> 00:10:59,083
What for?

185
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:03,667
Lord Satou has been
taking care of me so attentively lately.

186
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,875
I don't mind at all!

187
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:10,417
Unlike me, you're a delicate princess
who's been safeguarded for so long.

188
00:11:10,417 --> 00:11:13,125
Besides, Satou likes caring for people.

189
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,667
But that still makes you jealous.

190
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:22,042
Well... You're right about that.

191
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,333
You only feel this way
because you love him.

192
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:33,583
It's evident how deep your love
for Lord Satou goes.

193
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:37,375
I, on the other hand,

194
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,542
can only look at him with admiration.

195
00:11:40,542 --> 00:11:44,833
My feelings for him
aren't as strong as yours.

196
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,417
Is someone like me

197
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:52,375
even capable of fulfilling
my duty as the Ring King's wife?

198
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,083
Unbelievable.

199
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,125
This guy never stood a chance.

200
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,292
Satou?

201
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:07,583
Hime!

202
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:08,958
Nephrites is with you too.

203
00:12:09,792 --> 00:12:11,333
Something is not right.

204
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,708
We just saw a man get beaten.

205
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,375
Why?

206
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,833
Come now!

207
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,917
Come for a blind date with Her Highness!

208
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,708
This is the princess of Needakitta?

209
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,333
Who is next?

210
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,958
Are you the Ring King?

211
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,958
To become my husband,

212
00:12:57,958 --> 00:13:00,167
you must be stronger than me.

213
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,250
Are you strong?

214
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,333
We'll know soon.

215
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:09,542
Satou!

216
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:19,250
Satou!

217
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,583
What a disappointment.

218
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:25,500
I was quite excited when I heard
you were the chosen Ring King.

219
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,875
Can a weak man with those rings

220
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:30,875
really defeat Abyssal Creatures?

221
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,292
If you want a rematch,

222
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:34,708
come again.

223
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:42,792
There are plenty of people waiting
to have a blind date with me.

224
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,542
Observe your opponent's eyes.

225
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,125
If you focus too much
on the sword's movements...

226
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:58,917
This happens.

227
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,833
Ouch.

228
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:03,167
I couldn't even land a hit.

229
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:04,417
Not even once.

230
00:14:07,792 --> 00:14:10,333
Come now, comrades of the Ring King.

231
00:14:10,333 --> 00:14:11,667
It's time to get your food.

232
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:14,500
All right. Let's take a break.

233
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,292
Only a strong warrior can hope

234
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:24,792
to marry the Ring Princess of Fire.

235
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,542
But we're in a predicament

236
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:30,292
where no one in this country can beat her.

237
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,500
Therefore, we invited men
from various races around the world

238
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,250
to have a blind date with her.

239
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,375
Granart Needakitta,

240
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,958
the strongest catfolk princess
this generation has ever seen.

241
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,125
Can I really defeat her?

242
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,375
Given your skill in swordplay,

243
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:50,625
you won't stand a chance
even after ten thousand matches.

244
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,000
So what's the point of this training?

245
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,583
I mean, I did somewhat notice it.

246
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,583
Don't forget the rings you're wearing.

247
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,208
Are you sure?

248
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,917
Using magic seems like cheating.

249
00:15:06,042 --> 00:15:09,250
Magic is the mage's muscles in combat.

250
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,083
It's considered a strength too, sir.

251
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,250
Plenty of human mages
come for the blind date as well.

252
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,167
Well, they all got beaten up pretty badly.

253
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,000
The rings' magic is extremely powerful.

254
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,750
You just might win if you make use of it.

255
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,958
Probably.

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,708
Come on, eat up.

257
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,708
You can't get stronger
on an empty stomach.

258
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:32,750
Yeah!

259
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,042
Another challenger...

260
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:52,375
Incredible!

261
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,625
Satou.

262
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,250
Hime, it's you.

263
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,458
You had a long day.

264
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,042
Is the training over for today?

265
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,667
No. I'm just taking a break.

266
00:16:17,417 --> 00:16:20,792
Gramps is giving me
a magic lesson this afternoon.

267
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:21,875
I see.

268
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,125
Can you lie down for a little?

269
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,625
This is your reward for your hard work.

270
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,625
What a gorgeous view.

271
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:36,375
Do you feel better now?

272
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,625
Not just better.

273
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,833
With your encouragement,

274
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,875
I can take on any challenges.

275
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,833
You're so innocent.

276
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,000
So,

277
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:59,042
it's okay for you to be weak, Satou.

278
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,583
But I can't be weak.

279
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:08,125
You are going to marry five princesses
and collect their rings.

280
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:11,542
Then, you use the rings' power to fight.
That's all.

281
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,958
The ring's power depends on our bond
as husband and wife.

282
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,667
I'll be sure to fulfil my duty.

283
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:23,083
You don't have to
force yourself to become stronger.

284
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:28,792
But that would make me so useless.

285
00:17:28,792 --> 00:17:31,875
Just maintain your slightly useless look.

286
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,917
That's it.

287
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:41,208
Satou, it's time for your magic training.

288
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,583
I must go now.

289
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:55,250
I didn't understand a word Gramps said.

290
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,292
Am I going too hard?

291
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,333
Satou.

292
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,333
Ouch!

293
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,667
You did great today.

294
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,250
You did pretty well for someone
who has barely held a sword.

295
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,292
I was surprised

296
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,542
by how good you are at martial arts.

297
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,458
Do I look that weak?

298
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,667
That's not what I mean...

299
00:18:19,667 --> 00:18:22,250
I just don't take you for
someone who likes fighting.

300
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,375
Just a hunch.

301
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,208
As a member of the royal family,

302
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,292
I must be a scholar and a fighter.

303
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,833
That's just how it is
with the kingdom I was born into.

304
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,583
My father and brother
are even more impressive than me.

305
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:38,042
I can't even hope to be
as capable as them.

306
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:41,583
But if you were the Ring King,

307
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,500
do you think you'd have a chance

308
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,250
to defeat Granart Needakitta?

309
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,667
In terms of swordplay,
I'd probably lose.

310
00:18:49,667 --> 00:18:50,875
Is she that strong?

311
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,792
Gentlemen, would you like some scrubbing?

312
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:56,417
It feels really nice.

313
00:18:57,875 --> 00:19:00,250
Could you scrub my back?

314
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:03,083
Scrub this gentleman's back.

315
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:04,708
I'm counting on you.

316
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,667
I'm scrubbing this gentleman's back.

317
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:15,417
I should get going.

318
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:16,542
This can't be happening.

319
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:19,167
Having smooth skin
is the secret to becoming popular.

320
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,375
It also alleviates
the fatigue you got from training.

321
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,333
Hold on!

322
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,208
Let's begin.

323
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,167
"SHINY"
You look even more masculine now!

324
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,292
The princess...

325
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,458
Satou, right?

326
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,625
You may call me Granart.

327
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:46,125
Well? Most of the fatigue
should be gone now.

328
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,250
Given the rare opportunity,
I have a favour to ask.

329
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,833
What...

330
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:59,458
Scrub my back.

331
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:02,208
You just had it.
I'm pretty sure you can get it done.

332
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,792
But I'm a man

333
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:05,333
and I know nothing about this!

334
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:06,458
It doesn't matter.

335
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:10,042
You lost in a fight against me.

336
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,667
It's not too much to do me a favour, no?

337
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:14,833
Very well.

338
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:21,625
How does my body feel?

339
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:24,958
It's... It's impressive.

340
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,667
Underneath the smooth skin

341
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:28,583
are the soft but rigorous muscles.

342
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,250
Her arms are definitely

343
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,625
stronger than mine.

344
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,708
I'm tired from the blind date today.

345
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,042
All the men who challenged me

346
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:41,125
were boring fellows
too eager to prove their worth.

347
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:43,250
Honestly, I'm sick of this.

348
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,083
And then, you arrived.

349
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:51,000
It's the Ring Princess's duty
to follow the Ring King.

350
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,458
I'd be glad to give you a hand.

351
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,917
I don't mind if you want me

352
00:20:57,917 --> 00:21:00,625
to throw the rematch.

353
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,542
What...

354
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:02,500
Shush.

355
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,917
Not so loud.

356
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:07,333
However, we must put on an act.

357
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,583
It has to be convincing.

358
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,583
Just as you did to the other princesses,

359
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,667
simply make me yours.

360
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:17,917
This body

361
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:19,958
will give you a great amount of pleasure.

362
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,167
I know those rings are the real deal.

363
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:28,542
At least you are worthy of wearing them.

364
00:21:31,417 --> 00:21:33,625
I'll cooperate from here on.

365
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:39,125
I don't need your pity.

366
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:40,917
I'll fight you with all I have!

367
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,417
In that case, do your best.

368
