1
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:03,083
Ewwww...

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,958
She ran away.

3
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:08,917
Unbelievable.

4
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:12,167
She is a hopeless shut-in.

5
00:00:12,167 --> 00:00:13,458
You saw for yourselves.

6
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,583
That was the princess of this nation.

7
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,625
It won't be easy
to earn the ring from her.

8
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:22,833
Excuse me, but who are you?

9
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,792
I am Jade Lomka,

10
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,000
the firstborn of
the former King Lomka.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,042
The girl who ran away
was the Ring Princess of Wind,

12
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,167
Nephrites Lomka, my little sister.

13
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:35,250
So,

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,167
are you the new Ring King
people have been talking about?

15
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,792
What...

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,208
What... What is the meaning of this?

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,208
Release me! Let me go!

18
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:54,875
We will keep him
under our supervision for now.

19
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,042
Naturally,

20
00:00:56,042 --> 00:00:58,875
you will be treated as dignitaries.

21
00:00:59,792 --> 00:01:01,083
Satou...

22
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:08,417
Excuse me, did I do something wrong?

23
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:11,500
My sister, Nephrites,

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,708
is a very sensitive person.

25
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:17,542
Well, she seemed a bit timid.

26
00:01:17,542 --> 00:01:18,583
She acted like a child...

27
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:22,500
Your standards don't apply to her,
cursed human!

28
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:26,417
Listen closely.
Nephrites is my angle.

29
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:28,250
She is innocent and kind.

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:31,000
Despite her bashful demeanour,

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,792
she likes her big brother a lot.

32
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:37,417
She is such a nice little girl!

33
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,708
However,

34
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,958
for various reasons,
she has never set foot outside the palace,

35
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:45,250
much less another country.

36
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,958
She is not accustomed to seeing outsiders.

37
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,833
Besides, she is only 54 years old.

38
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:53,417
It's way too early for her to get married.

39
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:55,250
Fifty-four years old...

40
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,125
As her older brother,

41
00:01:57,125 --> 00:02:00,917
I must stay by her side, nurturing
and safeguarding her with my warmth.

42
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:05,375
You'll stay here for the moment.

43
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,042
We will release you in 80 years.

44
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:08,792
Eighty years?

45
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,750
By then,

46
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,250
Nephrites will be a bit more mature.

47
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,750
She can wait all she wants,

48
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,583
but I don't live that long!

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,292
Is this really appropriate?

50
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:25,333
It doesn't matter.

51
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:30,333
The Abyss King or not,

52
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,875
our nation will be safe
as long as we have the gust barrier.

53
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:38,000
Our top priority is to protect the source
that powers this barrier,

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,792
the Ring of Wind.

55
00:02:52,708 --> 00:03:00,042
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

56
00:04:14,417 --> 00:04:16,667
It's been three days.

57
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:20,042
Am I going to rot in here forever?

58
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:21,708
Ring King.

59
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,708
Who are you?

60
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,875
Keep your voice down.

61
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:36,333
What are you trying to achieve
by collecting the five rings?

62
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:37,958
For world peace?

63
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,167
For power beyond anything?

64
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:42,958
For the beautiful princesses?

65
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,833
I don't know what you want,

66
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,292
but I want to give Hime a happy life.

67
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,500
I want to have a happy marriage with her!

68
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,083
A weirdo indeed.

69
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,375
You have the power of the Ring King,

70
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,542
but you only set your eyes on one woman.

71
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:07,333
I admire that.

72
00:05:16,792 --> 00:05:18,625
Come with me.

73
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:23,000
Why are you helping me?

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,833
I am the person
who safeguards the nation's future.

75
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,875
Only you have the power

76
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,833
to stand against
the Abyss King, Ring King.

77
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:35,000
Prince Jade locked you up
despite knowing that.

78
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,875
He did it to keep the barrier up.

79
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:42,167
It's a cage that keeps our people here.

80
00:05:57,292 --> 00:05:58,792
All right. Here we are.

81
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,417
This is the Shrine of Wind,

82
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,333
where the Ring of Wind resides.

83
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,833
The ring...

84
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,250
Yes.

85
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,583
That is one of the five rings,

86
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,000
known as the Seal of Wind.

87
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,750
Nephrites was
supposed to inherit that ring.

88
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,500
What is it doing here?

89
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,333
Shouldn't the princess carry it instead?

90
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:28,875
Hide!

91
00:06:32,833 --> 00:06:34,875
A giant fur ball is moving.

92
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:36,917
No. That thing is...

93
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,917
Father, Mother,

94
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:54,583
the Ring King has come
from the outside world.

95
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,542
He is going to take me and the ring away.

96
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,500
But I will never let myself
be taken to the outside world.

97
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,583
I will do as you said, Mother.

98
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:10,333
Please continue
to defend the peace of this nation.

99
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,292
Does she always pray to the statues?

100
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:19,875
Statues? You are mistaken.

101
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,583
They are two pathetic guardians

102
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:25,500
whose hearts have died,
and their bodies turned into stone,

103
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,208
but they continue to generate
the barrier with the ring's power.

104
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,407
They are the former elven king
and his queen.

105
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:35,500
Who's there?

106
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,125
We've been made.

107
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,833
Chirp-chirp-chirp...

108
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,750
What are you doing?

109
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,708
Isn't it obvious?
I'm trying to muddle through.

110
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:44,917
You fool!

111
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,750
There are no birds in here!

112
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,250
Do... Do you want to play hide-and-seek?

113
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:54,417
Sh... Show yourselves, intruders!

114
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,583
It's me, Ring King Satou.

115
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,792
Ring... Ring King!

116
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,292
Unbelievable.

117
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:09,542
She is still just as timid.

118
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:13,167
Your Highness,
did something happen in there?

119
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:16,042
We wouldn't want anyone to find us here.

120
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,042
Take Nephrites with us, Ring King.

121
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,333
Where are we going?

122
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,042
Relax.

123
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,500
I know the lay of this place
like the back of my hand.

124
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,292
You can count on this elven elder.

125
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:28,833
You... You're an elder?

126
00:08:32,792 --> 00:08:34,000
Your Highness?

127
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,542
Nephrites has gone missing?

128
00:08:36,542 --> 00:08:37,292
Yes.

129
00:08:37,292 --> 00:08:39,583
I saw her entering the Shrine of Wind.

130
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,375
But she went missing afterwards.

131
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,833
Has anyone seen Nephrites?

132
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,625
Could it be...

133
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,292
I've known her
from the moment she was born.

134
00:09:00,792 --> 00:09:02,667
She may be a shut-in,

135
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,458
but she is resilient.

136
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,708
This shouldn't be too much for her.

137
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,375
Fulfil your mission.
Earn her ring.

138
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,917
Take your time.

139
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:20,958
No, no, no!

140
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,750
No!

141
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,667
I'm only after the ring.

142
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:26,375
That's all and nothing else.

143
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,833
Ring... Ring King!

144
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,667
Calm down! I won't hurt you!

145
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:38,708
Please calm down!

146
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,375
I knew it.

147
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,708
There's no doubt about it.

148
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,333
It's that scoundrel's doing!

149
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,583
That's correct, Jade.

150
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,250
Elder.

151
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:04,833
The Ring King
and the Ring Princess of Wind have left.

152
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,625
They eloped.

153
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,792
E... Eloped!?

154
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,000
Impossible.

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,333
Nephrites is too scared of strangers.

156
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,875
High time you faced reality, Jade.

157
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:22,292
Your little sister eloped
with the guy she likes!

158
00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:25,833
She will never say
"I like you, Big Brother" ever again!

159
00:10:30,542 --> 00:10:33,625
Jade. You need to cool your head.

160
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:36,500
It's the princess' destiny
to inherit the Ring of Wind

161
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,167
and become the Ring King's power.

162
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:43,042
Your action is not
in Nephrites' best interest.

163
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,125
Nephrites' best interest...

164
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:51,625
My parents still have the ring.

165
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:54,750
The nation is
still protected by its power.

166
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,458
That's all that matters.

167
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,333
Nephrites doesn't
need to inherit the ring.

168
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:05,042
Elder, I'm going to search your residence.

169
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,375
Sorry.

170
00:11:08,375 --> 00:11:11,333
I'm sorry you had to wash my clothes too.

171
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,917
I had to wash mine anyway.

172
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:19,833
I threw up on the legendary Ring King,
who came from another world.

173
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:21,750
How could I do such a terrible thing?

174
00:11:26,667 --> 00:11:27,708
Hey,

175
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,083
am I really that scary?

176
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,750
You are very much so!

177
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,208
You didn't hesitate to answer that.

178
00:11:32,917 --> 00:11:37,500
I grew up inside the palace.

179
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,583
I've always been scared of outsiders.

180
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:44,542
I was told you came from another country,

181
00:11:44,542 --> 00:11:48,208
a country that was not of this world.

182
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:54,625
I did come from another world.

183
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,792
But I'm not that special.

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,292
The people in this world

185
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,208
are pretty much no different from me.

186
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,333
What was your world like?

187
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:11,125
I meant the world you lived in.

188
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,125
What was it like?

189
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,167
Well, let's see...

190
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,792
Is it a scary place?

191
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:22,625
With hordes of orcs and waves of goblins?

192
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,875
Do dragons attack people on the street?

193
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:25,833
A world like that...

194
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:30,083
No! There are no monsters in my world!

195
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,458
You can even say it's pretty peaceful.

196
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,042
What about elves?

197
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:38,292
Are there elves in your world?

198
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,042
El... Elves?

199
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:40,917
Yes!

200
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,125
She's too close.

201
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,542
I mean... There probably aren't any.

202
00:12:45,542 --> 00:12:47,792
I see.

203
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:52,708
Are you interested in my world?

204
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,625
After all, I was told
you were a shut-in.

205
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,458
I thought you'd hate this kind of thing.

206
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,667
Sorry!
It was your brother who told me that.

207
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:05,250
Was I too rude?

208
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,833
It's all right.

209
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,792
I know everyone says that about me.

210
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:15,958
But I'm still interested
in the world outside this palace.

211
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,208
However,
I am scared of learning the truth.

212
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:26,458
I read books about the outside world
that I get from the Elder.

213
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,375
I imagine the view out there

214
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:29,750
and the smells I'll find.

215
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,583
What is the world like?

216
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:36,167
Simply thinking about it
makes me excited and happy.

217
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:38,458
I feel like I can go anywhere.

218
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:42,292
But the truth is,
I've been home the whole time.

219
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:43,750
There is nothing I can do.

220
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:45,917
Weird, right?

221
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,333
There's nothing you can do...

222
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:53,125
We are very much alike.

223
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,792
I didn't come here
because I possessed special powers.

224
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,750
I only came here to be with
the girl I like.

225
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,958
Things may be tough,
but as long as we try,

226
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,625
we'll figure something out.

227
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,292
As long as we try...

228
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,792
I'd love to

229
00:14:14,792 --> 00:14:17,542
live in your world someday!

230
00:14:17,542 --> 00:14:19,458
Will you take me there?

231
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,458
Take me there!

232
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,125
I'm fine with that.

233
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,167
But before that...

234
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:37,000
Sorry! I was too caught up
in the conversation!

235
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,208
But I don't get it.

236
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,625
You're so curious about the outside,

237
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,583
but why haven't you left the palace?

238
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,417
That's because...

239
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,167
Nephrites!

240
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:51,417
That voice...

241
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:55,833
Nephrites! I know you're in there!

242
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:57,042
Come out!

243
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,458
I only became the Ring King
because I wanted to be with Hime.

244
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:05,083
It's my mission to collect the rings.

245
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,792
However, I have no intention
of forcing you into marrying me.

246
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:11,958
Hime? Do you mean Princess Krystal?

247
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,542
You can decide what to do with me.

248
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,375
I'll try my best.

249
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,542
I'm sure my brother will understand.

250
00:15:30,417 --> 00:15:32,917
Step away from her, Ring King.

251
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:34,042
Satou...

252
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:38,708
Brother!

253
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:42,708
The Ring King is not who you think he is.

254
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,167
Don't be silly.

255
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,625
He deceived you.

256
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,917
Our parents still have the ring.

257
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:52,125
The nation is still protected.

258
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,417
You know what's at stake.

259
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:57,750
That doesn't change the fact
that I will inherit the ring someday!

260
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,500
I can't hide
under your protection forever.

261
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,250
I must...

262
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:04,375
Nephrites.

263
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,708
I am not asking for your consent.

264
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,875
Are you going to betray our parents?

265
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,000
Come here.

266
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:22,292
Princess Nephrites.

267
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:31,083
Ring King,

268
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,917
not only did you escape from your cell,

269
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:36,167
but you abducted
our adored Princess Nephrites.

270
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:38,375
You should prepare for what's coming.

271
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:41,208
Hold on, Jade.

272
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,792
This is all my doing.

273
00:16:43,792 --> 00:16:45,042
Elder...

274
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:49,375
I have no idea
what you're trying to achieve,

275
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,875
but you've crossed the line this time.

276
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,833
You're no better, Jade.

277
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:58,875
The way you treated
the Ring King was unforgivable.

278
00:17:00,042 --> 00:17:03,250
I will keep an eye on the Ring King.

279
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,625
I hope you don't mind.

280
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,875
Very well.

281
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,417
You are not allowed
to see Nephrites again.

282
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,417
Is that clear?

283
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,625
I was so worried about you.

284
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:26,542
Are you hurt?

285
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:27,792
I'm all right.

286
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:30,542
It wasn't easy
to be locked up for three days, though.

287
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:33,417
Wonderful. You were saved
by the gorgeous princess.

288
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:38,125
And you two somehow became closer.

289
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,917
Are you jealous?

290
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,500
What's wrong with that?

291
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,042
No, there's nothing wrong about it.

292
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,625
Sorry I couldn't visit sooner,

293
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,125
Ring Princess of Light.

294
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:02,167
I am the oldest elf in Lomka,

295
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:03,792
Peridot.

296
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,167
Erm...

297
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,958
I am the Princess of Nokanatika,

298
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,167
Krystal Novaty Nokanatika.

299
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,708
Elder,

300
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,542
did Nephrites become the way she is now

301
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:17,625
because of her parents?

302
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:23,375
Ring King, Ring Princess of Light,

303
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:26,167
I want you to know

304
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:30,583
why Lomka is surrounded
by a barrier of gust

305
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:33,583
and why Princess Nephrites became
the way she is now.

306
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,125
In the past,

307
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,875
Nephrites and Jade's mother

308
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,958
was not the first in line
to inherit the ring.

309
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,375
She had an older sister.

310
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,417
To keep outsiders
from having the ring,

311
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,625
to keep the ring safe,

312
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,292
there was a custom for elven princesses

313
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:53,083
to select a husband among our people.

314
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:58,208
However, the older sister
fell in love with a traveller.

315
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,875
He was a human.

316
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,667
The elves were sent into disarray.

317
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:05,125
If the traveller
could get one of the rings,

318
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,375
he could leave the tribe with it.

319
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,000
No. Truth be told, the traveller

320
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,292
approached the princess
to get his hand on the ring.

321
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,125
Rumours started spreading.

322
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,250
As rumours spread,
people became paranoid.

323
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,833
Paranoia eventually became a belief.

324
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:25,208
The stronger the objection,

325
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:28,167
the deeper the princess' love
for the traveller grew.

326
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,292
However...

327
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,958
The traveller left the princess.

328
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:39,000
It's unknown whether our people
banished him to protect the ring

329
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,292
or had him killed.

330
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,917
That's terrible.

331
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:46,333
People would
go to such an extent for the ring?

332
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:51,250
The rings have always been
a symbol of power since the mythical age.

333
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,458
More exaggeratedly,

334
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,917
it serves as a symbolic declaration of
the nation's justification for existence.

335
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:58,625
For countries without those rings,

336
00:19:58,625 --> 00:19:59,917
they are so dazzling.

337
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:03,708
His disappearance
was a relief for the elves.

338
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:04,750
But to the princess

339
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,208
who had suddenly lost her lover,

340
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,708
who knew what they looked like?

341
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,125
Warped by desperation and anguish,
the grieving elder princess

342
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,000
left a curse

343
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,542
before leaving the nation.

344
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:21,583
"Let Lomka be consumed by the Abyss.

345
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,667
Let the inheritance
of the ring be severed,"

346
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:24,750
she said.

347
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,708
Curses are a heavy burden for elves

348
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:31,875
because of our longevity.

349
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:35,750
People lived in fear because they didn't
know when she'd have her revenge.

350
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,500
As time went on,

351
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,542
fear slowly loomed over
more and more people.

352
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:43,000
Even the royal family
couldn't escape that fate.

353
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,958
Nephrites' parents inherited the rings
in the elder princess' place.

354
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,208
Due to their fear for the curse,

355
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,917
they unleashed the Ring of Wind's power

356
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:55,750
to keep evil beings away from Lomka.

357
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,875
A barrier of gust
was cast around the borders.

358
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:01,333
All of it was for the sake
of this nation and their children.

359
00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,083
However, that came with a price.

360
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:10,167
Then, they made a deal with Nephrites.

361
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:14,583
She was forbidden
from leaving the barrier.

362
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:17,833
That was how the nation become caged.

363
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:22,996
Nephrites believes she must follow through
or even risk her life

364
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:24,625
to fulfil the promise she made.

365
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,167
Nephrites.

366
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:33,125
This is the last chance I can talk to you.

367
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,083
An elf's lifespan has no limits,

368
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:38,000
but the body will be petrified

369
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
when the heart stops.

370
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,708
Why did your heart stop?

371
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:45,125
Listen.

372
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,875
You must never leave this nation.

373
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:49,875
Promise me.

374
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,875
Until the day comes,

375
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,083
we'll keep protecting you.

376
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,667
Farewell, my beloved children.

377
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:08,750
Mother...
