1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,167
We're giving up on the Ring of Wind?

2
00:00:04,167 --> 00:00:05,792
While we dilly-dally here,

3
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:09,542
the Abyss King's army is
probably approaching.

4
00:00:09,542 --> 00:00:12,917
We can't stay here forever.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,750
But...

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,417
We're not giving up on the ring
but coming back for it later.

7
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:24,125
Our priority is collecting
as many rings as possible.

8
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,792
With your current strength,

9
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:29,042
you're no match
for the Abyss King's knight.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,333
You have a point.

11
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,333
Are you concerned about the princess?

12
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:39,875
Yeah.

13
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:43,125
I feel like
I've disrupted her peaceful life.

14
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,000
They are finally leaving.

15
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,375
The story of the Ring King is a myth

16
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:57,292
that even the seemingly immortal elves
can't tell if it was real.

17
00:00:57,292 --> 00:00:59,750
Our duty is to protect the people

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,500
living in this city.

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,583
Prince Jade!

20
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:04,583
What is it?

21
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:05,625
Bad news!

22
00:01:05,625 --> 00:01:09,458
The Abyssal Creatures
have breached the gust barrier!

23
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,417
What?

24
00:01:11,417 --> 00:01:12,250
A powerful monster

25
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,958
tore a hole in the barrier.

26
00:01:14,958 --> 00:01:18,042
It's sending in the other monsters!

27
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:20,917
The barrier has been breached!

28
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,917
A mere monster actually broke through

29
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,333
my parents' barrier!?

30
00:01:24,917 --> 00:01:26,042
There are more monsters

31
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:28,583
waiting to attack outside the barrier!

32
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,667
Those are

33
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,292
Abyssal Creatures!

34
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,000
How did they get in?

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,833
Is the barrier not working?

36
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:46,083
That direction...

37
00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:48,250
They are headed for the palace!

38
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,458
Let's turn back, Satou.

39
00:01:51,458 --> 00:01:53,333
The ring must be protected.

40
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,292
Yes.

41
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, Satou...

42
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:20,917
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

43
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,500
Release the arrows!

44
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,000
The monster breached the barrier.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,917
Are you ever going to come out?

46
00:03:50,542 --> 00:03:52,792
My brother will figure it out.

47
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,167
There's nothing I can do.

48
00:03:57,417 --> 00:04:00,083
I promised my mother I'd stay here

49
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,167
and keep my head down.

50
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:07,333
If that's what you want,

51
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,667
feel free to stay here
and turn into a statue.

52
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,167
An elf with a dead heart will never live.

53
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:32,375
As I anticipated,
you're after the Ring of Wind.

54
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,500
You're using this chaos
to lower the barrier

55
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,375
so your army outside can break through.

56
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,292
Not on my watch!

57
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:53,750
Is this

58
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,250
the Abyss King's knight
that attacked Nokanatika?

59
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:01,750
But I can't back down.

60
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,083
I must protect

61
00:05:06,917 --> 00:05:09,917
my parents' legacy!

62
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,750
We made it in time.

63
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,875
Ring King!

64
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:26,833
What are you doing here?

65
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:28,000
Let me be clear.

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,708
I didn't come back to save your neck.

67
00:05:30,333 --> 00:05:32,250
This is her home.

68
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,875
I couldn't defeat you last time.

69
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,292
But today, I will.

70
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,000
I have plenty of power to take you down.

71
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,542
Keep your eyes to the front!

72
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:47,292
If you fall here,

73
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:48,917
the world is doomed.

74
00:05:49,542 --> 00:05:51,375
Do not push yourself too hard.

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,042
Of course. All that matters
is to reach her in time.

76
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:56,833
Fool...

77
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,083
The swords won't cut her.

78
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,417
All magic attacks are negated.

79
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:08,333
You're fighting a foe
you can never hope to defeat.

80
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,917
Satou is well aware of that.

81
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:15,708
But no matter how strong the enemy is,

82
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,708
Satou will keep us safe.

83
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,583
I can say the same.

84
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,333
From the day

85
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,958
I swore to protect my sister,
this has been my only purpose in life.

86
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,083
I must protect Nephrites!

87
00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:36,125
I'll free her from the ring's curse!

88
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:42,792
I knew this would happen,

89
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,375
but things aren't looking good.

90
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:48,667
I thought I'd be stronger than this.

91
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,833
Hime?

92
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,458
It's nothing.

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,292
Stay safe.

94
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,250
I can't do it alone.

95
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:15,625
If it's just me...

96
00:07:16,667 --> 00:07:18,833
Hime, stay away.

97
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,042
Nephrites.

98
00:07:37,042 --> 00:07:39,167
It's me, Krystal.

99
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:47,667
Satou... We should retreat.

100
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:50,375
No can do.

101
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:53,792
That thing is after the Ring of Wind.

102
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:55,625
So I can't run away.

103
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,042
Ring King!

104
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:01,167
The Ring Princess of Light
went to get Nephrites.

105
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:02,167
Hime?

106
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,500
Why would she do that?

107
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,292
She is doing this for you.

108
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,708
You have a great wife.

109
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:13,958
Let's buy her some time!

110
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,792
Please.

111
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,458
Please marry Satou.

112
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,750
We've never had a proper introduction.

113
00:08:26,667 --> 00:08:29,583
Is it all right to speak as your peer?

114
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,250
You can tell me if you don't like it.

115
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:37,250
My parents

116
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,792
died protecting me and the ring.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,125
I know your duty to safeguard

118
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,958
and inherit the ring

119
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:49,708
is a heavy burden.

120
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,833
I find myself useless
because I couldn't do anything

121
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:55,708
except be protected by others.

122
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:02,083
My parents sacrificed their lives

123
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,500
to create the gust barrier.

124
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:08,125
They did it so I wouldn't
have to inherit the ring.

125
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,583
I can't betray their sacrifice.

126
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,333
We are not the same.

127
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,958
You are correct about that.

128
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:21,958
However,

129
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,083
it's the reason
you can still save everyone.

130
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:26,917
You're not as helpless as I was.

131
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:29,833
Everyone is fighting.

132
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:32,750
Your brother
and the elder are all fighting

133
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,917
the Abyss King's knight,
no matter how powerful it is.

134
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,708
That's because

135
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:41,292
it's the responsibility
of the ring bearers.

136
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:42,250
No!

137
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,208
Satou is risking his life

138
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,958
to defend your home!

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,125
That's the reason he is fighting!

140
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,458
Lord Satou...

141
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,208
He may not look like it,

142
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,083
but he is thoughtful.

143
00:09:56,083 --> 00:09:58,625
He won't give up until the very end.

144
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:00,375
There's a possibility he might get killed.

145
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,208
But even so...

146
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:05,167
There's nothing I can do for him!

147
00:10:05,167 --> 00:10:06,125
I hate it,

148
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,792
but I can't do it by myself!

149
00:10:08,542 --> 00:10:11,542
Please save Satou.

150
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:14,250
Please marry Satou.

151
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,958
Can I really help?

152
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,500
Hime! Nephrites!

153
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,958
Nephrites! What are you doing here?

154
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,667
Brother, you can give me an earful later.

155
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:51,625
Are you sure about this?

156
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,458
Yes.

157
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,125
What are you two doing?

158
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:03,208
Father! Mother! I'm sorry!

159
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,833
The barrier is disappearing.

160
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:18,875
What happened?

161
00:11:21,667 --> 00:11:22,833
Lord Satou!

162
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,667
This is bad.

163
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,375
Without the barrier,

164
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,167
hordes of monsters will swarm in!

165
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:55,958
Don't worry.

166
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:58,542
Lord Satou's Ring of Light

167
00:11:58,542 --> 00:12:00,167
and Ring of Wind can take care of them.

168
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,750
Incredible.

169
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:30,750
Satou, this is it!

170
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,167
Yeah!

171
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:39,167
I can command the wind!

172
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,958
Hime... Nephrites...

173
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:05,833
I...

174
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,458
You're finally awake.

175
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:18,292
I expected nothing less
from the man chosen by the Ring of Light.

176
00:13:18,292 --> 00:13:21,125
That was quite
a display of the rings' might.

177
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,583
Ring King.

178
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,583
I must thank you

179
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:34,792
for saving the nation of Lomka
from the Abyss King's army.

180
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,917
I thank you

181
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:39,958
on behalf of Princess Nephrites Lomka.

182
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:43,875
Who... Who is this?

183
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:48,708
The older sister
of the late empress of Lomka,

184
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,708
Princess Sumaragdi.

185
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,792
I thought she left the country

186
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:54,958
after losing her lover

187
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,583
to the ring.

188
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,375
Why are you here?

189
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,958
Don't you remember

190
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,875
the knight wearing a mask?

191
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,917
The Abyss King's knight

192
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:15,083
was actually the lost princess?

193
00:14:15,708 --> 00:14:16,792
See?

194
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:22,000
A black Ring of Wind.

195
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,458
That thing seemed
to have controlled her mind.

196
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:26,833
But now, it's powerless.

197
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:33,333
I cursed my ill fate
with the Ring of Wind

198
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,667
and the world that forced me
into accepting reality.

199
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,167
That dark thought

200
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,458
gave him the opening.

201
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,458
Pick up the ring.

202
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:53,250
I'll free you from the suffering and pain.

203
00:15:00,042 --> 00:15:04,292
The Abyss King would go as far as this?

204
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,583
From what we know,

205
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:08,917
the Abyss King lost his physical form

206
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:10,667
after the great battle
with the first Ring King.

207
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:14,875
His soul was sealed far away in the north,
at a place known as Varna.

208
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:15,917
That's all we know.

209
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,500
But even without his form,

210
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,083
the Abyss King's familiars
never stopped attacking the humans.

211
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:27,458
And given his power to create black rings
for his knights,

212
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,500
the threat is more than apparent.

213
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,250
I see.

214
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,542
I need to collect all the rings
as soon as possible and end this.

215
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,042
Satou!

216
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,917
I'm feeling light-headed.

217
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:46,000
You used a massive amount
of the rings' power.

218
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,917
It would've killed
a normal king instantly.

219
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:51,125
You only feel exhausted

220
00:15:51,125 --> 00:15:54,417
because your bond
with the two princesses protected you.

221
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,458
You should thank them.

222
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,417
The two princesses...

223
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,167
Yeah.

224
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,750
We married in the end.

225
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,333
I married another girl.

226
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,500
But I...

227
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,042
Nephrites...

228
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:11,625
Lord Satou!

229
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,958
There is a healing spring in the palace.

230
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:16,125
Let me take you there.

231
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:17,917
You'll be good to go in no time.

232
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,458
What is going on now?

233
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,583
Yes.

234
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:40,417
I know how deep
your love for each other goes.

235
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,875
I'd like to ask Princess Krystal
for some guidance

236
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:46,042
since she became your wife before I did.

237
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,042
Wh...

238
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,708
You're right.

239
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:53,250
Satou and I really love each other a lot.

240
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,542
We've kissed so many times!

241
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:56,750
Many times?

242
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,667
We do what couples do at night,

243
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,750
and we do it every single night!

244
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,500
Huh!?

245
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,625
Every night...

246
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,750
I see.

247
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,417
Show me

248
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:10,708
how you cultivated this love of yours.

249
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:17,250
I had a lot of intimate experience
with the human here,

250
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,583
but despite sharing the same looks,

251
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:23,333
the methods could be different
from those from another world.

252
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,750
This is a perfect chance

253
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,458
for me to observe the whole process.

254
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:31,542
Come on.

255
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:32,667
Come on.

256
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:33,583
Come on.

257
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,250
Nephrites, watch and learn.

258
00:17:39,792 --> 00:17:40,708
Hime?

259
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,042
Hold on, Hime...

260
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,750
This is the perfect chance, Satou.

261
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,542
At least I won't falter at this moment.

262
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:05,292
Hold on, Hime!

263
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,458
I'm not going to
let the mood of this place

264
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:12,292
control my mind!

265
00:18:23,667 --> 00:18:26,500
You are the Great Sage.

266
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,333
Do you know anything

267
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,917
about the young traveller

268
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:33,583
who came here 50 years ago?

269
00:18:34,542 --> 00:18:36,500
He was my love.

270
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,250
Was he killed?

271
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,667
Or did he escape alive?

272
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,375
That was my gift to him!

273
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,542
Where did you get it?

274
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:58,042
The two of us
have known each other for ages.

275
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:00,083
Is he still alive?

276
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:03,875
He once said,

277
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,958
"I can't allow the woman I love
to become estranged with her people

278
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:10,208
because of me."

279
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:15,250
He now lives a peaceful life
in a land far away.

280
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,625
I see.

281
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:25,667
He's always wanted you to be happy.

282
00:19:25,667 --> 00:19:28,667
I'm glad to have the chance
to relay his thoughts.

283
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,875
Father. Mother.

284
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,917
Until you become stronger,

285
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:52,125
we will never stop protecting you.

286
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,208
I'm all right now.

287
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,583
Also, I've found a purpose.

288
00:20:02,667 --> 00:20:03,958
Are you leaving?

289
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,208
Brother.

290
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,792
Yes. I am leaving.

291
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:12,917
You've become so strong,

292
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:15,958
Neph.

293
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,250
Lord Satou!

294
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,083
Nephrites.

295
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,583
Are you sure about this?

296
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,667
Yes.

297
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:33,750
Being with the Ring King
and assisting him in his cause

298
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,250
is a Ring Princess' duty.

299
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,708
Besides,

300
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:41,125
I want to see the outside world.

301
00:20:41,958 --> 00:20:43,167
I want to visit

302
00:20:43,167 --> 00:20:45,458
Lord Satou's world someday.

303
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:48,667
That's a promise!

304
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,542
Satou, when did you say that?

305
00:20:53,042 --> 00:20:54,208
Oh...

306
00:20:54,208 --> 00:20:55,750
Hey!

307
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,708
You are unbelievable.

308
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,583
Will the Ring Princess find happiness,

309
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:07,667
Elder?

310
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,625
No.

311
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,625
You're
one of the earliest Ring Princesses,

312
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:14,708
Princess Peridot.

313
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,542
All the Ring Princesses I've met so far

314
00:21:19,542 --> 00:21:21,875
have never had happy endings.

315
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,583
It was the same
for the first Ring Princess.

316
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:27,833
The new Ring King

317
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,792
is a bit too bashful for a king,

318
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:34,750
but this quality of his
might shift things in a better direction.

319
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:40,208
Has the Ring King left?

320
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:41,292
Yes.

321
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:43,167
They should be
out of Lomka's border by now.

322
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:44,625
I see.

323
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,750
I'd like to see Great Sage Alabaster.

324
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,125
Alabaster?

325
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,333
That's him...

326
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,458
What's the matter, Gramps?

327
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,125
No, it's nothing.

328
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,583
Let's press on.

329
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,042
I don't want to
spend the night in the wild.

330
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:08,250
Fine.
