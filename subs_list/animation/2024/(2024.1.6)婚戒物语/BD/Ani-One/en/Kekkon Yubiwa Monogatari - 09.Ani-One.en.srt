1
00:00:03,792 --> 00:00:05,250
Now is the time

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,667
for this newly wedded wife
to sleep with you

3
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:10,583
to strengthen the bond between us.

4
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:14,958
In that case, I should sleep
the closest to him.

5
00:00:15,542 --> 00:00:18,417
I share the deepest bond with him.

6
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:21,500
I should be right next to him.

7
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,875
I'd like to sleep in the middle.

8
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,000
Huh?

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,083
I should just sleep in my own bedroom.

10
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,458
This is ridiculous.

11
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:34,417
No. The more, the merrier.

12
00:00:35,042 --> 00:00:38,542
Distance will hinder
the channelling of mana.

13
00:00:38,542 --> 00:00:41,083
Therefore, stay close to him.

14
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,208
Well...

15
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,167
It's just a little tearing of a wound.

16
00:00:45,167 --> 00:00:47,417
It's not as serious as you think.

17
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:49,292
Satou, shut up!

18
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:50,792
Yes, madam.

19
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:54,625
Sleeping with everyone here
feels too weird!

20
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,042
We should take your feelings
into consideration.

21
00:00:57,042 --> 00:01:00,750
Hey, didn't you just tell him to shut up?

22
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:03,708
You're getting on my nerves!

23
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:05,042
Let us all calm down.

24
00:01:05,708 --> 00:01:06,958
In this situation,

25
00:01:06,958 --> 00:01:10,000
my instinct as a man should be cheering!

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,917
But I can't follow my instinct
and accept this madness.

27
00:01:14,583 --> 00:01:16,417
Everyone, listen to me.

28
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,333
Whatever happens,

29
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,833
Hime always means the most to me.

30
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,542
Satou...

31
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,708
I'm aware of that.

32
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,625
I don't really care about
my ranking in your heart.

33
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,667
I will wait for as long as it takes.

34
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:36,958
A brief moment of love
is all that I ask.

35
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:39,458
I'm also fine with any method.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As long as you carry out your duty,

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,958
I can do anything.

38
00:01:44,958 --> 00:01:47,667
I will do anything for your sake.

39
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:50,375
What now?

40
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,000
They weren't listening at all.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Satou.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,042
You don't have the slightest sympathy
for the poor girls

43
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:00,917
tortured by this ill fate.

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,917
Therefore...

45
00:02:04,917 --> 00:02:07,000
we shall have our way with you!

46
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,958
Hold on, Granart.

47
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:16,375
Ring King,
my heart and soul are all yours.

48
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,792
Hold on... When did you get naked?

49
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:25,500
Lord Satou, please teach me
everything you know.

50
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,042
Not you too, Nephrites!

51
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:28,250
What is going on here?

52
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:33,083
It's not bad this way.

53
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,708
Not bad...

54
00:02:34,708 --> 00:02:36,375
Wait! That's not the point!

55
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:43,792
What is it? Why are you hesitating,

56
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,583
Ring King Satou?

57
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,958
Who's there?

58
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,167
Follow your power.
Follow your desires.

59
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,042
Just seize everything!

60
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:56,208
No. That still puts me
in a tough situation here.

61
00:02:56,208 --> 00:02:58,375
I can't be with everyone at the same time.

62
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,000
Besides, I already have...

63
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,458
You seem troubled.

64
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,500
You're the worst, Satou.

65
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,875
Hime?

66
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,167
No! You got it all wrong!

67
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,208
This is just...

68
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:13,458
Hime!

69
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,167
You're the one I love the most!

70
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,042
Just a dream.

71
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,208
This can't go on forever.

72
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:38,792
Hime, let's go out today.

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,958
Huh?

74
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,417
What?

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,125
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

76
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,417
Well... You know...

77
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,750
We've been staying in the palace
ever since we came to the Kingdom of Water.

78
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,917
I want to check out other places.

79
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:25,500
Nice idea.

80
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,083
It's going to be so much fun.

81
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,833
Sorry.

82
00:05:28,833 --> 00:05:31,333
I only want to go with Hime.

83
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:35,792
Are you just going to leave me behind?

84
00:05:36,917 --> 00:05:40,833
What is all the noise
so early in the morning?

85
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,125
The Ring King needs rest
before he recovers his power.

86
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,792
As long as you stay out of trouble,

87
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,875
you can go anywhere you want.

88
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,875
I got it.

89
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:56,708
Leave this place to me.

90
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,750
You two can have fun.

91
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,833
Right, Nephrites?

92
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,667
Yes.

93
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,625
Are you sure?

94
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:06,458
You can count on me.

95
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,625
Thanks.

96
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:12,208
I thought Granart would be
against it the most.

97
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,750
Whatever. This is great.

98
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,250
I'm so excited.

99
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,667
The soap Saphir gave me smells great.

100
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,125
I should use more of it.

101
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,208
Hime, I love the scent of your body.

102
00:06:34,042 --> 00:06:35,500
I can't hold it anymore.

103
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:39,000
Nah, just kidding.

104
00:06:48,417 --> 00:06:50,042
What?

105
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:52,708
You're asking me for an allowance?

106
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,625
I'd like to go out with Hime.

107
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,417
I don't have any money from this world.

108
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,833
I see.

109
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,958
So, how far will you take it?

110
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,708
We are checking out the surrounding areas.

111
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,667
I mean your relationship with Hime.

112
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:13,292
Don't ask me that all of a sudden.

113
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:15,417
Don't worry.

114
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,542
I threw in a little extra money for you.

115
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:21,000
For your accommodation.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,583
It's all right to spend the night outside.

117
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,167
I told you! That's not the plan!

118
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,542
Sorry for the wait, Satou.

119
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:33,167
This world is not the same
as the world you came from.

120
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,625
Don't let others' opinions bother you.

121
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,542
Give it your best, young lad!

122
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,000
Where are we going?

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,250
I asked Saphir for a list of attractions.

124
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,250
Everything is planned.

125
00:07:52,998 --> 00:07:54,331
Are you sure about this?

126
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,000
Should we be tailing them?

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,167
We are his wives, too.

128
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:03,458
We have the right to be treated
as Krystal's equals.

129
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,958
I see.

130
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,250
Therefore, we must pay close attention
to their relationship.

131
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,625
If they ever get it done,

132
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,458
we can use it as leverage against Satou.

133
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,708
I get it now.

134
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:16,208
I thought you dragged me out
for something important.

135
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,583
So this is why we're here.

136
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,750
All the best.

137
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:21,083
All right, let's follow them.

138
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:28,042
You must be the legendary Ring King.

139
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,667
Welcome.

140
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:30,667
Yes.

141
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:33,667
To think you actually won
the heart of our proud Princess Saphir.

142
00:08:33,667 --> 00:08:35,417
She may be intelligent,

143
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:37,042
but she's far from likeable.

144
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,417
How rude. I'll remember you.

145
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:45,792
You look surprisingly mediocre.

146
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:47,625
I thought you'd be a lot more muscular.

147
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,333
Can I get your autograph?

148
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,208
I'm off-duty at the moment.

149
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,625
This doesn't feel like a date.

150
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, Satou seems to be having fun.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500
That's good enough.

152
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,708
Satou isn't the Ring King today.

153
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:09,375
He is the normal boy I used to know.

154
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,042
Knowing that fills me with joy.

155
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,000
When was the last time Satou actually

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,708
asked me out?

157
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,167
What is this?

158
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:24,458
An authentic eel pie.

159
00:09:26,292 --> 00:09:27,958
It was me who asked him out

160
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,042
during the summer festival.

161
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:33,708
I thought I'd never see him again.

162
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,583
Thank you for coming here, Satou.

163
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,500
What... What's wrong?

164
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,833
You have a smudge on your face.

165
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,208
Don't be so clumsy.

166
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,958
The mood is looking good.

167
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,458
I envy them.

168
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:59,708
I also feel kind of lonely.

169
00:10:00,292 --> 00:10:02,875
Don't let this dishearten you.

170
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:07,208
It's common knowledge in his world
that one can only have one lover.

171
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:10,625
It's nothing more than a concept.

172
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:12,750
The world won't change because of it.

173
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,792
All we need to do is to change his mind.

174
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:17,542
You sound imposing.

175
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:20,042
Nothing can be done
unless you show some determination.

176
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,292
A park?

177
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,542
A place where people go on dates.

178
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,333
I never went on a date. I wouldn't know.

179
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,958
Me neither.

180
00:10:40,292 --> 00:10:42,667
There is a fishing pond.

181
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,000
What is this place?

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,458
What is it?

183
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:02,500
When two people in love
kiss each other here,

184
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,667
they will be together forever.

185
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,333
Such is the legend of this fountain.

186
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,500
What? We should go in there...

187
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,000
It's just a rumour that started
after I was born.

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,333
This is so silly.

189
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,333
She is looking at me.

190
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:26,625
Is she waiting for me
to make the first move?

191
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:30,625
Very well.

192
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:50,208
No! Doing that in public is

193
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:51,125
a little...

194
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,292
You have a point.

195
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:56,792
Speaking of that,

196
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:01,792
I rarely get a chance to look
at Hime's face so closely.

197
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,083
Well, Satou,

198
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:09,583
are you too embarrassed to kiss me?

199
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,125
Just as I thought.

200
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,792
For me, you are...

201
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,500
I can't stand this any more.

202
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,333
I'm heading back.

203
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,958
Yeah.

204
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,250
It seems a little mean to keep watching.

205
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:28,792
You guys are no fun.

206
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:31,917
I doubt they'd make any progress today.

207
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,500
Let's hope they do better
in the future.

208
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,583
What's so funny, Nephrites?

209
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:43,333
I've never gone out
and have fun with friends.

210
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:45,333
I'm so happy right now.

211
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,708
Friends, huh?

212
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:52,375
Don't you think the age gap
is too big for us to be friends?

213
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:59,083
Sorry... Sorry about that.

214
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:02,875
"MAGIC ICE CREAM"
We'll have two, please.

215
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,208
Right away.

216
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,667
Are you tourists?

217
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:08,125
Or are you on honeymoon?

218
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:20,500
A special discount
for the match made in heaven!

219
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,417
This is huge.

220
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:37,333
This is the world where you came from.

221
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,417
I thought I should protect it.

222
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,542
But it's the same today.

223
00:13:46,542 --> 00:13:49,333
The Ring Princesses and their nations,

224
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:52,042
Mr. Marse and Princess Saphira,

225
00:13:52,042 --> 00:13:54,083
are all normal folks

226
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,500
living normal lives.

227
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,625
This world and mine
are not that different.

228
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,583
I think that is great.

229
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:07,292
Am I sounding like a hero?

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,417
Very much so.

231
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,250
Even your expression looks like one.

232
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:19,083
I never thought
you'd become this way, Satou.

233
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,000
It's getting dark.

234
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,500
Let's head back after we finish this.

235
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,458
I had a lot of fun today.

236
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,625
Thanks.

237
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,250
Oh...

238
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,667
I should confirm this.

239
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,375
Can I consider this a date?

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,167
That's what I think.

241
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,667
I see. It didn't look like a date?

242
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,167
Well... Don't get me wrong.

243
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:54,875
We just never did this before.

244
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,583
I don't get why

245
00:14:57,583 --> 00:15:00,208
you suddenly asked me out.

246
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:03,708
We have feelings for each other,

247
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,417
but we've never done the things
normal couples do.

248
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,708
That must feel great.

249
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:15,625
I want to be like them.

250
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,792
It may sound weird,

251
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:23,375
but I yearn for that.

252
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,958
I... I see.

253
00:15:29,417 --> 00:15:32,542
But you know,

254
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:34,708
we shouldn't do it again in this world.

255
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,833
You can't always favour me alone.

256
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:46,042
The others are your wives as well.

257
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,750
I'm happy with the special treatment.

258
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:54,667
But it's making things
a lot harder for me.

259
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,542
You carried out your duty
as the Ring King flawlessly.

260
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:04,083
But I...

261
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:06,333
Don't be silly.

262
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,167
You're always the number one in my heart.

263
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:12,250
No! It has nothing to do
with your place in my heart!

264
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,542
My heart belongs to you alone!

265
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:22,125
That is not right.

266
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:29,167
The Ring Princesses
carried out their duty

267
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:32,208
and made the decision to follow you.

268
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,500
You mustn't let
their dedication be in vain.

269
00:16:38,792 --> 00:16:41,500
You are worthy of being the Ring King.

270
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,917
It's all the more reason
to care about the others.

271
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:47,083
But only you can have my heart.

272
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:49,917
If you still don't get it...

273
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,542
I messed up!

274
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:22,417
I just did something
really embarrassing!

275
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,708
Let's... Let's head back.

276
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:29,250
No. I don't want to go back.

277
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,875
Only I can have your heart, right?

278
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:39,208
Hold on... Does it mean...

279
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,292
Are we really going to do it now?

280
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:45,625
It's all right to spend the night outside.

281
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,417
Should I say yes?

282
00:17:48,417 --> 00:17:50,500
No! Now is the time

283
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,792
to say this!

284
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:59,333
Are you spending the night here
or taking a break?

285
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:04,167
It's doable!
The greatest first experience ever!

286
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,958
Say yes, Satou!

287
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:11,708
I can't believe I just said that...

288
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,500
Everyone is waiting for us.
Let's head back.

289
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,167
Let's do it another time.

290
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,417
Why should I go too?

291
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,208
You know why.

292
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:44,792
Without the mana
from the Ring Princesses,

293
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:46,917
the Ring King can't battle the enemies.

294
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,458
But there are still the other three.

295
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:53,875
Incredible!
There's no limit to your stamina.

296
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,375
Are you scared of leaving your homeland?

297
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,958
You never struck me as the cowardly type.

298
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:04,875
Look at Princess Nephrites,
who was once a home dweller.

299
00:19:04,875 --> 00:19:07,250
Even she came with us.

300
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,708
Of course.

301
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:12,917
I'm like an infant
if you compare my age with hers.

302
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,167
That's right.

303
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:18,042
Let Saphira go on my behalf.

304
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:20,833
That seems to defeat the purpose.

305
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,000
Just kidding.

306
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,708
Sorry. I never thought
it'd turn this ugly.

307
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,500
I expected Marse to stay.

308
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:39,042
No. It's all right, Sister.

309
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:43,333
Prince Marse has found his purpose.

310
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:47,667
Besides, I love him because he is

311
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:49,708
so honest and sincere.

312
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:51,667
So...

313
00:19:51,667 --> 00:19:54,542
Will you be all right without me?

314
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,667
Don't worry.

315
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,750
While you are away,

316
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,208
Father and I will protect Maasa.

317
00:20:03,625 --> 00:20:06,167
Please stay safe, Sister.

318
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,167
Use the power of your ring

319
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,292
to protect Prince Marse.

320
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,375
Yes. You can count on me.

321
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:23,958
We are going to the Kingdom of Earth next.

322
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,250
What is it like?

323
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,333
The Kingdom of Earth, Idanokan.

324
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:30,667
It's located in the north,
far away from Maasa.

325
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:34,333
It's a dwarven city standing
on a tall mountain range.

326
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,542
That's what I learned from the books.

327
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,125
Dwarves?

328
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:41,375
The kind with a beard and a ripped body?

329
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:42,958
Well...

330
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:45,583
Are we meeting a dwarven princess?

331
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,125
Well...

332
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,083
Gramps, don't you know anything?

333
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:54,000
The dwarves went extinct
during the Ring King's battle

334
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,833
with the Abyss King.

335
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,667
There is nothing
but ruins of Idanokan left.

336
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,208
Legend has it

337
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:06,542
that the people hated outsiders
and were excellent craftsmen.

338
00:21:06,542 --> 00:21:07,750
They followed the Ring King

339
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,708
and fought the Abyss King bravely.

340
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:14,750
The already small population
was significantly reduced.

341
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:18,333
After the battle, they lived underground
to hide from the world.

342
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,042
Then, they simply faded
from the world's eyes.

343
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:23,417
So, there isn't a Ring Princess,

344
00:21:23,417 --> 00:21:26,000
and much less rings.

345
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,708
But we are headed there now.

346
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,708
You must know a thing or two,

347
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,958
Great Sage.

348
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,917
No idea.

349
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,292
-No idea?
-What?

350
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:42,875
We'll figure it out once we are there.

351
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,458
If there's nothing we can do,

352
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,917
we can come up with a different solution.

353
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:49,750
We can see it from here.

354
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,667
The Great Mountain Range of Kaogamika.

355
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,125
Idanokan is located

356
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:59,542
on this towering mountain range.

357
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,000
All right,
we'll travel on foot from here on.

358
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,875
Let's get moving, guys!

359
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,875
Seriously?
