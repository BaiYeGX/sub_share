1
00:00:05,542 --> 00:00:06,792
It's been ten years

2
00:00:07,042 --> 00:00:10,375
since Great Sage Alabaster
first uttered the prophecy.

3
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:13,167
The day has finally come.

4
00:00:24,042 --> 00:00:25,125
Almost there...

5
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:28,000
What is that?

6
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,000
What is going on?

7
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,250
Aliens?

8
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,042
A girl?

9
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,542
May I know your name?

10
00:00:48,542 --> 00:00:51,000
Me? I'm Satou.

11
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:52,458
I see.

12
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,125
It's an unusual name.

13
00:00:54,792 --> 00:00:59,042
My name is Nokana... You can call me Hime.

14
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:01,167
Hime?

15
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:02,083
Satou.

16
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:05,417
You must tell anyone
about what you saw here.

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,542
It's better for you to simply forget it.

18
00:01:10,833 --> 00:01:13,042
In return,

19
00:01:13,708 --> 00:01:16,083
I'll be your friend.

20
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,083
I was a little boy back then.

21
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:24,958
Despite that,

22
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:30,042
I knew I had to protect her.

23
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:37,000
I will carry that thought
until the end of time.

24
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:57,083
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

25
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:13,542
TEN YEARS LATER

26
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:20,417
Good morning, Satou.

27
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,083
Hime.

28
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,250
Good morning.

29
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,167
I made you breakfast.

30
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,750
This is a bit overkill for breakfast.

31
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,667
After today, it's summer break.

32
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:37,417
I woke up early without realising it.

33
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,250
Hime.

34
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,458
Hime Nonaka is my childhood friend.

35
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,833
It's been ten years
since they moved into the house next door.

36
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:51,250
I think her parents
are out of the picture.

37
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,792
She lives only with Gramps.

38
00:03:56,917 --> 00:04:01,000
You've changed a lot
ever since you started high school.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,417
You used to be very bashful.

40
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:06,417
I'd draw more attention to myself

41
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,292
if I intentionally kept a low profile,

42
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,500
given my unique hair colour.

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Besides, I'm a princess.

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,125
It's crucial for me to be strong.

45
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,917
You've been saying that
since we were kids.

46
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:23,708
What?

47
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,625
Hime...

48
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,333
I got it for you.

49
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,667
Gramps.

50
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:56,833
Good morning, Gramps.

51
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,792
Good morning, Satou.

52
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:01,208
We're headed out.

53
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,583
Stay safe.

54
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,500
Is your father coming back?

55
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,083
He won't be back until after summer break.

56
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,667
It must be tough.

57
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:14,042
I'm used to it.

58
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,250
This ring

59
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:24,833
is meant for the man I'll marry someday.
It means a lot to me.

60
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,292
Satou.

61
00:05:28,792 --> 00:05:32,958
Will you marry me when we grow up?

62
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,667
What are you looking at?

63
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,333
You're never getting this.

64
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,125
This ring is very important to me.

65
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,042
Whatever, a childhood promise

66
00:05:49,042 --> 00:05:50,292
shouldn't be taken seriously.

67
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,333
Hurry up. We're going to be late.

68
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:55,000
Coming!

69
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,500
How did you do in the finals?

70
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,333
My grades are terrible.

71
00:06:00,917 --> 00:06:02,042
Check this out!

72
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:05,083
Impressive, Hime!
It must be nice to be smart.

73
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:09,667
As a princess,
it's my duty to be smart.

74
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:10,917
There you go again.

75
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:13,333
Which country's princess are you anyway?

76
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:16,875
Summer break begins tomorrow!

77
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,333
I envy you, Satou.
You don't feel the stress at all.

78
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:22,292
Having a girlfriend is so much better.

79
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,625
You know I mean Nonaka!

80
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,875
You come to school together every day!

81
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,917
That's only because she lives next door.

82
00:06:30,917 --> 00:06:32,000
You know,

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
things won't stay the same forever.

84
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah.

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,417
Don't come begging for help
when you lose her one day.

86
00:06:39,417 --> 00:06:40,542
I'd start dating her immediately

87
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:42,417
because of how cute she is.

88
00:06:42,417 --> 00:06:43,417
"LET'S GO TO THE SUMMER FESTIVAL LATER"
No, I don't like that.

89
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:44,917
"MEET UP IN FRONT OF THE SHRINE AT 6 PM"
She is too flashy.

90
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,875
-Why is she texting me?
-So, what is your type, then?

91
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:51,625
I prefer the more reserved
and innocent type.

92
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:56,083
-Wait... It wouldn't harm to have hope!
-There you go, the reserved and innocent.

93
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:01,458
Hime!

94
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:05,167
A yukata?

95
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,458
What's wrong?

96
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,833
Are you mesmerised by my charm?

97
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:11,333
Yeah.

98
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,833
That's... That's very honest of you.

99
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:17,833
All right. Let's go.

100
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:18,875
Okay.

101
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,208
COTTON CANDY, BUTTER POTATO

102
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,208
"BBQ, TAKOYAKI"
This place is neat!

103
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:26,458
Festivals never fail to get me excited.

104
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,958
Satou.

105
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,875
Do you remember?

106
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,583
When we were kids,
we got lost in the festival.

107
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:37,958
You said we shouldn't get separated,

108
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,708
so you held my hand the whole time.

109
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,292
You were so cool back in the days.

110
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:46,167
Am I not cool now?

111
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,417
What do you think?

112
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,250
Anyway, let's grab some food.

113
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,583
They are so cute!

114
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,375
Are... Are you serious?

115
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,208
It's always been this way
for the two of us.

116
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,125
Satou, I want that!

117
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:17,208
One shot.

118
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,625
That's 500 yen.

119
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,792
Rather than ruining our relationship,

120
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,083
keeping things the way they are now
isn't too bad.

121
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:29,083
However...

122
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:46,625
It'll work.

123
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:50,083
The mood is just right.
I know it's going to work.

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,375
I... I want you to know that...

125
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:58,708
It's so beautiful.

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
It's wonderful

127
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,625
to be watching this with you.

128
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,292
Me too.

129
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,875
Satou.

130
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,083
There is a secret

131
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:25,542
I could never bring myself to tell you.

132
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,417
Hold on, what's going on?

133
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,333
Does it mean...

134
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,667
It can't be...

135
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,375
I...

136
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,458
I want you to know...

137
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:40,167
I'm moving away.

138
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,000
When?

139
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,917
Tomorrow.

140
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,042
I'm going back to Gramps' hometown.

141
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,750
It's somewhere very far away.

142
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,833
You can't be serious!

143
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,375
Satou.

144
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,000
Thanks for tonight.

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hime.

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,375
I...

147
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm so glad
I could watch the fireworks with you.

148
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,375
And the festival too.

149
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,917
And the doll you got me.

150
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,583
Do you really have to move away?

151
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,833
In the end,

152
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,375
you gave me a wonderful night to remember.

153
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:29,417
Goodbye.

154
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:30,375
Hime!

155
00:10:33,042 --> 00:10:34,292
Hime...

156
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,708
She is leaving for somewhere far away.

157
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:41,667
But where exactly is that?

158
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:45,375
Now that I think about it,

159
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,583
I thought I knew everything about her,
but I actually knew nothing.

160
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,042
Even the day when I first met her.

161
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,042
It felt like...

162
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:04,708
That's right.

163
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:09,375
Something extraordinary
must have happened that night!

164
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,042
Hime!

165
00:11:19,917 --> 00:11:21,208
Don't go!

166
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:24,333
So you do remember.

167
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:27,333
In that case, you must know

168
00:11:28,542 --> 00:11:30,000
I lied about moving away.

169
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,417
I'm leaving for a world

170
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:34,000
that is entirely different from yours.

171
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,750
I'm getting married.

172
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,167
After all, I am a princess.

173
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,708
It's inevitable.

174
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,500
Hold... Hold on!

175
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,667
So this is truly the farewell.

176
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,042
Farewell, Satou.

177
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:53,375
I had a great time here.

178
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,917
Hime!

179
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,333
What did I come here for?

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,792
At this point, am I supposed
to just watch her leave?

181
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:08,125
No!

182
00:12:08,917 --> 00:12:10,083
In that case...

183
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,875
Overthinking won't do me any good.

184
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Princess Nokanatika,

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,833
Krystal Novaty Nokanatika,

186
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:31,375
the Second Prince of Gisaras,

187
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,792
-Marmarugias Gisaras,
-Who is that man?

188
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:36,667
-you shall now become husband and wife...
-He appeared right after the princess.

189
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:37,458
What is this place?

190
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,792
With your sacred kiss...

191
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,958
Who are you?

192
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:41,833
Hime!

193
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:46,375
Satou...

194
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,583
Princess Krystal, who is he?

195
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,375
Stand down!

196
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,542
Help!

197
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,292
It's an Abyssal Creature!

198
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,708
As expected,
it's come to take the princess' life!

199
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:05,875
-It was the right call
-Great Sage Alabaster!

200
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,125
-to hide the princess
-It's the Great Sage!

201
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,417
-in another world.
-Great Sage Alabaster!

202
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,458
Hyah!

203
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,667
Hime's grandpa?

204
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,958
Satou? What are you doing here?

205
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:21,500
As expected, we need the Ring of Light.

206
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,708
Krystal!

207
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,375
Give the prince the Ring of Light!

208
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,250
Satou!

209
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,250
I have a bad feeling about this...

210
00:13:34,667 --> 00:13:35,708
Satou!

211
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:55,250
Are you kidding me?

212
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,750
So, you've made your decision,
Princess Krystal.

213
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,042
Your Excellency, use this sword!

214
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:02,875
Impressive.

215
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,208
This is a real sword.

216
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,167
Wait, it's cool and all,

217
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,833
but how am I supposed
to fight that monster?

218
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,708
Satou, watch out!

219
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,625
I still quite get it,

220
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,625
but this must be the right move!

221
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,167
Huh?

222
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:40,000
Good morning, Satou.

223
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,208
Where am I?

224
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,917
The royal couple's bedchamber.

225
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:46,542
Couple?

226
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:49,917
Well, we didn't do it, didn't we?

227
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:53,208
The kiss of oath.

228
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:58,708
We... We did it!

229
00:14:59,292 --> 00:15:02,458
That means Hime really does...

230
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:08,417
Actually, I was supposed
to marry that prince.

231
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:12,208
But I barely know the guy.

232
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,333
I didn't want to marry someone like him.

233
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,833
Then, I saw a familiar face.

234
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,625
So I couldn't help it...

235
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:19,792
What?

236
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,542
So...

237
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:23,875
Sorry.

238
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,750
I made you my hero.

239
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,583
They say he is the Ring King.

240
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:31,958
He seems to have
come from a different world.

241
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,542
He was amazing!

242
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:36,917
With a single swing of the Sword of Light,
he cut the Abyssal Creature in half!

243
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,042
The wedding was supposed

244
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:43,750
to fortify the relationship between
the Empire and the Kingdom of Light.

245
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,917
When His Majesty learns about this,

246
00:15:45,917 --> 00:15:48,375
I bet he'll be furious.

247
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,000
The man chosen by the Ring Princess

248
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,375
is the Ring King,
the saviour of this world.

249
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:56,292
Both he and I

250
00:15:56,292 --> 00:15:58,500
are merely following our legacy
to save the world.

251
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:03,292
It has nothing to do with
what my father and the Empire think.

252
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:05,875
The Second Prince
is too boastful for his own good.

253
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,583
That's enough.

254
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:12,458
You said you wanted to
have an audience with His Majesty.

255
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:15,500
It's the only reason
I made the time to meet you.

256
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,708
Plenty of people are waiting in line
to see His Majesty.

257
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:23,958
All right, come with me.

258
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:30,958
Defeat the Abyss!

259
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,125
-Ring King will bring light to Arnulus!
-Ring King! Princess Krystal!

260
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:38,250
Okay, Satou,

261
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,375
say something.

262
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,042
Ring King! Ring King!

263
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:47,792
Everyone has been waiting
for the arrival of the new Ring King.

264
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,917
-You're the beacon of hope for this world.
-Ring King!

265
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,750
You should answer their anticipation.

266
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,542
I am...

267
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,708
I am...

268
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,167
I am Ring King Satou!

269
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,625
I've travelled from another world
to save your world!

270
00:17:08,958 --> 00:17:11,250
I'm your hero!

271
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,708
I think I got carried away.

272
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:24,750
Hime.

273
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:27,875
Hey! Satou!

274
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,625
What... What are you...

275
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,917
It can't be helped.

276
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,458
We are officially married.

277
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:34,667
Stop looking this way!

278
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:43,000
Sorry, Satou.

279
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,542
I knew this would happen
if I gave you the ring.

280
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,417
Why do you bring that up now?

281
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:52,583
You were never part of this.

282
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,125
It's my fault that...

283
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,208
I'm okay with this.

284
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:01,208
See, it's already summer break.

285
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,833
Besides,

286
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,083
I'm the husband
chosen by the Ring Princess herself.

287
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,625
I'm the Ring King.

288
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:08,708
Right?

289
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,000
It's not wrong...

290
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:17,000
It's not like you get to leave this place.

291
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,917
I'm from this world.

292
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:21,375
But you, on the other hand...

293
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,417
In that case, I'm staying as well.

294
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,333
That monster from yesterday
was after you and the ring you carried.

295
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,708
Since I'm the only one
who can keep you safe,

296
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:32,958
I'll never leave you.

297
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:38,625
Her hair colour is weird.

298
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:39,708
I bet she's a delinquent.

299
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:40,750
Delinquent!

300
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,083
Just ignore her.

301
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,917
Satou...

302
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:50,125
Yeah...

303
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,625
You've always been so cool.

304
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,125
Nothing.

305
00:18:58,042 --> 00:18:59,250
Thank you.

306
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,458
Hey!

307
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,333
So... Sorry!

308
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,375
Let me be clear.

309
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,875
The royal families' weddings
are nothing more than a formality.

310
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:16,542
I made you my husband by accident.

311
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:19,542
You don't have to
feel responsible for anything.

312
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,417
I know. However...

313
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:26,958
I'm glad you chose me

314
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,125
even though it was an accident.

315
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:40,208
You must really like me a lot.

316
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,458
Sure.

317
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:46,875
You like me as a friend, right?

318
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,958
Of course, you are my most important

319
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:53,417
friend.

320
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:57,583
I see.

321
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:02,542
What... What's going on?

322
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,000
Ring King...

323
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,292
The Ring King is here!

324
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:26,542
Over here.

325
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,333
Were you two having an intimate moment?

326
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,208
We haven't done it yet!

327
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,083
We haven't?

328
00:20:33,375 --> 00:20:34,583
Your Majesty.

329
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,542
We are under attack
by several Abyssal Creatures.

330
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:42,292
The monster you slew was
probably a scout.

331
00:20:42,292 --> 00:20:44,417
Please lend us your strength.

332
00:20:44,417 --> 00:20:45,417
You need me...

333
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,750
This is insane!

334
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,875
Satou has no combat skills whatsoever!

335
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:57,417
That won't change the fact
that he must fight.

336
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:01,042
Not as long as he has the ring.

337
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,167
Is that clear?

338
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:04,583
You can't be serious!

339
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:10,083
Sure. You can count on me.

340
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,208
Please use this.

341
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:20,208
The Ring of Light is Evil's Bane.

342
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:23,625
It gives everything you touch
the Banishing Light.

343
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,542
Its wielder will be blessed
with tremendous power.

344
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:27,500
In other words,

345
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,958
this is the ring that will create
the strongest weapons against the Abyss.

346
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,917
I don't know much
about this world's situation.

347
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:37,042
However,

348
00:21:37,042 --> 00:21:40,958
I know Hime's life is at stake.

349
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,750
That is why I will do my best to help.

350
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,542
Go, Ring King Satou!

351
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:59,667
Vanquish the evil beings!
Save our world from turmoil!

352
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,250
Stay safe, my love.

353
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,208
Certainly.

354
00:22:07,708 --> 00:22:09,083
I'll be right back.
