1
00:00:02,417 --> 00:00:06,750
Time to atone for your sin, Prince Marse.

2
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:10,917
Do so, and you shall have
His Majesty's forgiveness

3
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:13,292
and win back the princess you love.

4
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,875
Who are you?

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,583
A spy from the empire?

6
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,292
I am just a normal seer.

7
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:25,250
I can see your future

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,708
thanks to my divination.

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:29,083
However,

10
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:32,417
my divination is usually very accurate.

11
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:34,625
The last monster attack
was a good example.

12
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:40,542
The Ring King is an outsider
from a different world.

13
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:43,458
He is not meant to linger in this world.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,625
You were the one
worthy of becoming the Ring King.

15
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,875
I don't see why you should be concerned.

16
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,667
Or perhaps

17
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,292
you wish to go against His Majesty's will?

18
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,917
This sword is capable of altering
the flow of mana.

19
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:07,708
It's an ancient weapon

20
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:09,625
sung in legends and tales.

21
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,583
Now, you will carry it.

22
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:15,500
Despite not having any special abilities,

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,208
you can defeat
the Ring King with this sword.

24
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:21,375
Where did you get this?

25
00:01:32,042 --> 00:01:35,917
I certainly hope
you bring the rings back home.

26
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:37,583
I'll be waiting.

27
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:58,000
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

28
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,375
What is wrong with me?

29
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:31,667
After all the effort I've put into you,
you can't even handle a border country?

30
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:37,000
Do you know
what the officials think of you?

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,500
They see you as a living failure!

32
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:43,375
A new Ring King will be selected soon.

33
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:46,708
It's an old wives' tale,

34
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:50,042
but it serves as a great way
to earn the people's trust.

35
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:52,167
I trust you won't

36
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:54,125
fail a task as simple as this.

37
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:57,958
You are only valuable
because you're my son.

38
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,208
That's all there is to it.

39
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,667
Show me your worth,

40
00:04:02,667 --> 00:04:03,958
Marmarugias.

41
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:34,500
I've really lost everything.

42
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:41,292
What should I do?

43
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,250
That's right.

44
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:58,458
This is the only path to take.

45
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,417
We are launching a campaign
against the monster.

46
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,375
Are you sure I should stay?

47
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,417
The campaign is not your responsibility.

48
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:16,167
When a single unit gets too powerful,

49
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:18,125
the pacing of
the entire army will be disrupted.

50
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,750
You exist as a last resort

51
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,708
when push comes to shove.

52
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,875
Take care of this place.

53
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,292
Yes.

54
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,125
Satou!

55
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:48,458
Well... You know...

56
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:49,500
What is it?

57
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,042
Whatever!

58
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,833
If you have to go into battle,

59
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,333
at least you'll be ready.

60
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,542
Thanks.

61
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,333
Don't be so bashful. It's embarrassing.

62
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,917
Well, I'm still not used to this.

63
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,583
Allow me to lend you my strength as well!

64
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,750
Hold on! Granart!

65
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,125
What?

66
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,458
I'm his wife too.

67
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,208
Is it wrong for us to kiss?

68
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:25,583
No! But that doesn't mean...

69
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,375
Excuse me.

70
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:27,958
Can I...

71
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:29,083
Not you too, Nephrites!

72
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Is that a no?

73
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,167
Well, I'm not saying you can't...

74
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:35,750
Well...

75
00:06:38,375 --> 00:06:41,583
Nephrites is actually
so enthused for once.

76
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,250
All right, I get to do it again!

77
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,125
That's cheating, Princess Krystal!

78
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,125
What is going on here?

79
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,875
This is ridiculous beyond any words.

80
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:56,083
The bond with the Ring King
serves as the power source.

81
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,917
They are willing to share their power
to the Ring King.

82
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,333
Isn't that a good thing?

83
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,375
For real?

84
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,542
Report!

85
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:24,917
We are advancing smoothly
on the right and left flanks.

86
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,125
Is that so?

87
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:30,333
The monster army is somehow
acting the way our seer predicted.

88
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,417
At this rate,

89
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,417
victory will be ours for sure.

90
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,542
Prince Sluder!

91
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:36,667
A giant monster

92
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,750
showed up at the most unexpected location.

93
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,375
It will breach Maasa palace soon.

94
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:45,458
Please dispatch a troop to the palace.

95
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:48,125
No. We will defend this place.

96
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,542
The palace will do fine without us.

97
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:54,917
What's going on?

98
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:56,250
Hurry!

99
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,833
Into the palace!

100
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,875
A monster!

101
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,292
It seems there's only one.

102
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,208
Satou!

103
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:24,792
Mr. Marse!

104
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:27,000
Ring King.

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,792
I feel bad about this,
but you must die now!

106
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,708
Oh no!

107
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,583
I'll take care of the monster.

108
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,417
Satou, deal with Marse.

109
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,125
Mr. Marse.

110
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,542
What's going on?

111
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:47,583
Kill the Ring King

112
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,292
and bring the rings home.

113
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,250
Such is my mission as the empire's prince.

114
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,792
At this point,

115
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,667
it's the only thing I can do!

116
00:08:58,667 --> 00:08:59,625
Wait!

117
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,542
You must have a good reason to do this.

118
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,167
Tell me about it!

119
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:06,250
You said so yourself.

120
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,208
If it's important,

121
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,375
we should just take it!

122
00:09:11,292 --> 00:09:13,542
I became your guide

123
00:09:13,542 --> 00:09:15,583
and earned your trust

124
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:17,333
for this very moment.

125
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:20,375
For the sake of the empire,

126
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,375
you must fall!

127
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:23,708
Satou!

128
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,125
Marse is not acting like himself.

129
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,583
I fear he's being manipulated.

130
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:30,542
What should I do now?

131
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,667
Will holy water turn him back to normal?

132
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:34,125
How should I know?

133
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,000
That being said,

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,250
you must stop him.

135
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,208
Gramps! Why do you always
get so useless when I need you?

136
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,625
There's no way I can defeat him
with just my sword.

137
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,833
In that case...

138
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:55,208
How is this happening?

139
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,375
Amusing.

140
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,500
A sword that alters the flow of mana.

141
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,333
He's holding a nostalgic weapon.

142
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:06,250
Who would've thought that piece of trash
could wield this sword?

143
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:08,042
However,

144
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:11,458
it suits
that worthless young man very well.

145
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:12,917
I knew it.

146
00:10:12,917 --> 00:10:14,667
The ring is talking to me.

147
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,083
No need to hesitate.

148
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:20,042
With the power of the rings,
you can come out on top.

149
00:10:20,042 --> 00:10:22,083
Turn him into a pile of ashes.

150
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,167
I can never do that!

151
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:27,167
Would you rather get killed?

152
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,583
Shut it! You talk too much!

153
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,917
I told you, I can't do it!

154
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,125
Why would you hesitate to defeat a foe
with your own power?

155
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,208
What a fool.

156
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:40,125
That's true enough,
but how do I pull it off?

157
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,333
If I use my full power,

158
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,792
I could perish him like the ring said.

159
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:46,708
But Marse isn't an opponent
I can win by pulling punches.

160
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:51,458
Yeah. I've never defeated him.

161
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,875
So,

162
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,083
why am I still unscathed?

163
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:03,875
I knew it.

164
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,625
Mr. Marse never changes.

165
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,917
Satou is fighting Mr. Marse?

166
00:11:09,917 --> 00:11:11,042
Why?

167
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:12,458
No idea.

168
00:11:12,458 --> 00:11:14,417
Marse wants to steal the rings.

169
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,250
That fool!
He's going to get himself killed!

170
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,792
I knew it.

171
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:40,333
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me.

172
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:45,500
That's because you have a kind heart.

173
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,542
Kill me, Satou.

174
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,708
I was abandoned by my lover.

175
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:08,208
I'm a failure
who can fulfil my duty as a prince.

176
00:12:09,625 --> 00:12:13,375
I even hurt you.

177
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,583
I am utterly worthless now.

178
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:21,417
I quite like you, Mr. Marse.

179
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,167
Honestly, without you,

180
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:28,208
I would've died by now.

181
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,958
I've made it this far

182
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:33,125
because your kindness saved me.

183
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,333
If you think yourself worthless,

184
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,250
I'll make you priceless.

185
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:44,667
You're the comrade of a legendary hero
who will save the world.

186
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,833
Nothing can be more valuable than that.

187
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,000
I need you.

188
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,583
You want me to become...

189
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,042
Crush the gem at the hilt.

190
00:13:06,042 --> 00:13:07,583
Every one of them

191
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,042
is just as worthless.

192
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:12,708
My magic won't hold for long!

193
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:19,792
Oh no!

194
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,167
Hime!

195
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:32,000
Saphira!

196
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:43,208
Is it taking her hostage?

197
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,083
You ruined the gift I sent you,

198
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,542
Prince Marse.

199
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,833
I knew it. You are with the monsters.

200
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:56,750
It was you who cursed the sword.

201
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,333
Divination isn't an impressive art.

202
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,375
I merely unshackled the heart

203
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,792
and made his desire burn stronger.

204
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:09,208
You know that very well, Prince Marse.

205
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,333
No sudden movement

206
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,000
or Princess Saphira will die.

207
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,667
Well?
Will you trade the rings for her life?

208
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,042
You're right.

209
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,917
I envy Satou.

210
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,542
I even thought about taking his life.

211
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,333
However,

212
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,208
that's not all of me.

213
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:33,708
Satou risked his life
to make me realise that.

214
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,083
Mr. Marse.

215
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:39,417
I won't hesitate any more.

216
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,708
I will live for myself

217
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,917
and for those I cherish.

218
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,167
I'll walk my own path.

219
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,542
That's my worth.

220
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,250
Princess Saphira!

221
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,042
Please marry me!

222
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,083
Have you lost your mind?

223
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:08,375
Eat this!

224
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,917
It's cheating to say that now,

225
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,208
Prince Marse.

226
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,500
Sorry for the wait.

227
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,792
Curse you!

228
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,417
I was hoping to have fun with you

229
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:39,875
before the King fully awakens.

230
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:43,667
But I'm tired of playing by your rules!

231
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:46,750
Return to the abyss!

232
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,292
What is this thing?

233
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,000
She finally shows her true nature.

234
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,625
Unbelievable.

235
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:58,292
You really are a fool

236
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,750
who's kind to a fault.

237
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:02,917
But you're a nice fool.

238
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,667
What...

239
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:26,708
The power of this ring
commands the source of life.

240
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:31,875
Witness the true power of the Dragonkin!

241
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:40,833
She devoured the monster!

242
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:55,292
She slipped away.

243
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:58,958
Incredible.

244
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:02,583
Can you still turn back to normal?

245
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:09,792
Of course.

246
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:14,042
Don't look.

247
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,333
Satou.

248
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,583
Sorry,

249
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:23,667
let's finish what we started.

250
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:35,750
Thank you for saving Maasa.

251
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:38,500
Who is that dude?

252
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,042
My father.

253
00:17:40,042 --> 00:17:40,917
Huh!?

254
00:17:41,583 --> 00:17:45,250
I was bewitched
by the Abyss King's knight,

255
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,083
but I haven't missed a thing.

256
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:50,000
The Ring King and his legendary power

257
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,750
are all real.

258
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,208
As a Ring Kingdom,

259
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:57,208
Maasa will provide you with full support.

260
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:59,167
Thank you so much!

261
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:02,000
Heroes from the empire,

262
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,375
thank you for defending Maasa.

263
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,333
But from now on,

264
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,083
the Kingdom of Water will defend itself.

265
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,875
I was too stubborn and believed
I had to protect the kingdom myself.

266
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,167
I let it fall into the villain's hand.

267
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,833
But with an ally
as powerful as the empire,

268
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,458
I won't make the same mistake.

269
00:18:25,292 --> 00:18:27,083
That's wonderful.

270
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:30,667
We will rush to your aid
should the need arise.

271
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,292
Summon us with your will.

272
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,917
You went through a lot,

273
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,208
Saphir.

274
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,958
It seems she also has a candid side, huh?

275
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,458
You managed to
find yourself a great husband.

276
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,750
Huh?

277
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:59,292
He is just a fool with magic power.

278
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:02,833
You're still as bad
at judging characters.

279
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,292
Is... Is that so?

280
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:08,708
Water King.

281
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:11,833
As the Ring King's knight, Marmarugias,

282
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,333
I have a request to make.

283
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:17,000
Allow me to marry Princess Saphira.

284
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,250
Prince Marse...

285
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,875
No, I should call you Knight Marse now.

286
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,875
From the day you left

287
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,833
until Saphir made me come to my senses,

288
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,500
I had never paid attention
to Saphira's feelings.

289
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:34,292
I cared too much about the nation,
and my daughters suffered for it.

290
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,583
I've failed as their father.

291
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,792
I leave her in your capable hands.

292
00:19:43,292 --> 00:19:44,292
Yes!

293
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,333
Princess Saphira.

294
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,583
Prince Marse.

295
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,083
That's great.

296
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:03,833
I want to be like them.

297
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:08,875
Satou.

298
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,833
I got ahead of you.

299
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,792
What does that mean?

300
00:20:15,458 --> 00:20:17,458
We got married first...

301
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,250
Could it be...

302
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,750
They've done it!

303
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:29,083
Brother.

304
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:32,500
That seer and her monsters

305
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,625
and their connection with the empire...

306
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,583
A conspiracy is brewing

307
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,417
where I can't see.

308
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,500
I must return to the capital at once.

309
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:45,458
You must come home someday.

310
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:48,625
I'll be waiting.

311
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,375
Yes.

312
00:20:57,417 --> 00:21:00,500
You failed to take Maasa.

313
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,417
Yes.

314
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:06,375
It was under
the empire's control for a while.

315
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:08,208
But that cursed girl...

316
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,750
However, a puny nation like that

317
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,042
means nothing to Your Majesty.

318
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,708
As long as I still command the monsters

319
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:20,250
and we work together,

320
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,083
we can conquer more kingdoms.

321
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:27,625
Yes. You can accomplish that.

322
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:30,667
Show me your desire.

323
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,625
You'd come after me
now that Maasa is useless to you?

324
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,333
I only listened to you
because our interests align.

325
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,792
It seems the obsolete
can't be trusted after all.

326
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,500
Darn you!

327
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,083
You knew it all along!

328
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:56,625
We don't live in the age of gods.
It's the age of men!

329
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,375
I will eradicate
anyone who stands in my way.

330
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,875
Whether it's the Abyss King

331
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,083
or the Ring King.
