1
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,333
My body is doing better than expected.

2
00:00:14,042 --> 00:00:15,583
Good morning.

3
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,208
Nephrites!?

4
00:00:17,208 --> 00:00:18,708
When did you get here?

5
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,417
I was here the whole time.

6
00:00:20,417 --> 00:00:21,333
The whole time?

7
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:23,917
How is your body holding up?

8
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,042
The ring has the power

9
00:00:27,042 --> 00:00:29,833
to heal any injury.

10
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:33,042
You've been training so hard

11
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,750
so you can defeat Princess Granart.

12
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:39,208
You can put it that way.
I'm only doing my best.

13
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:43,083
But honestly,
I'll probably end up losing.

14
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,208
With the ring's power,

15
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:47,417
you can win.

16
00:00:49,625 --> 00:00:50,625
Of course,

17
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,625
it's best to have
the princess' recognition.

18
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:57,417
But the Ring King's mission

19
00:00:57,417 --> 00:01:00,333
is to collect all the rings.

20
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:04,042
For that, you must use
any means necessary.

21
00:01:04,042 --> 00:01:07,083
Well... I'm aware of that...

22
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:13,333
A Ring Princess's duty is
to assist the Ring King.

23
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:18,583
Lord Satou, simply follow your heart
and do what you think is necessary.

24
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:23,333
You are right.

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,750
Thank you, Nephrites.

26
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:34,458
I should try a little harder.

27
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:45,792
When I finally mustered my courage...

28
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:04,208
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

29
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:28,708
Whoa...

30
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,333
You've improved a lot.

31
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,958
Does it mean I can win?

32
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,583
At least once out of ten tries?

33
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,167
That's not possible.

34
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:39,583
I knew it.

35
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,875
Your opponent isn't going to
use these obvious attacks

36
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,875
like I did just now.

37
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,708
When you can counter that

38
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,125
and still pull off your moves earlier,

39
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:53,875
you might actually stand a chance.

40
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:57,542
Well, at least you can win once

41
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,042
out of ten thousand tries.

42
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:01,542
With the power from your rings,

43
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,042
she shouldn't be a problem.

44
00:04:06,042 --> 00:04:07,583
Again!

45
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,833
Is that the Ring King?

46
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:15,333
They said Princess Granart
has high expectations for him.

47
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,042
She even let him touch her body.

48
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,708
What do you mean by that?

49
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:30,292
She let him touch her body

50
00:04:30,292 --> 00:04:32,583
so he could give her a scrub.

51
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,625
But...

52
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:40,042
that doesn't change the fact
that Satou touched her.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,958
The body of that princess...

54
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:48,875
No!

55
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:54,333
Maybe it's time I stop saying no to that.

56
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:59,417
The Ring King is
having a rematch with her?

57
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:01,208
We don't get this kind of fight every day.

58
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:03,417
Ouch...

59
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,583
She's insanely powerful.

60
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,083
Ring King!

61
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,292
Princess!

62
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,542
-Ring King! Go for it!
-Princess Granart!

63
00:05:13,542 --> 00:05:17,083
Satou! Give it your best!

64
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:20,583
What's the matter, Krystal?

65
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,750
Aren't you going to cheer for him?

66
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,458
Satou has been training really hard lately

67
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,625
to earn Princess Granart's

68
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,250
recognition.

69
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:32,458
Does that even matter?

70
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:35,667
His job is to collect
rings from princesses

71
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:38,042
other than myself.

72
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,833
Just when I thought

73
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,333
I might have
the chance to become a king...

74
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:48,792
Ring King, show us what you've got!

75
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:50,417
That's not fair.

76
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,458
He gets stronger with his ring.

77
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,208
A ring?

78
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:04,833
Seize me if you desire more power.

79
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,750
Desire my power.

80
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,500
Not going to change your mind, I presume.

81
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,375
Yes.

82
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,083
I'll make you acknowledge my strength!

83
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,458
Hey, what are you doing?

84
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,792
Leave now.

85
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:33,625
Come another time if you want a rematch.

86
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,625
Silence!

87
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,333
Ring King.

88
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,708
You robbed me of my chance back in Lomka.

89
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,708
I won't allow it to happen again!

90
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,042
Ring King, dodge!

91
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,292
Abyssal Creatures!

92
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,375
That guy summoned the Abyssal Creatures!

93
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:19,750
Fire monsters?

94
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,542
Stand back, Your Highness!

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,042
The catfolks have been training
night and day

96
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,000
for the resurrection of the Abyss King

97
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,083
after he was defeated.

98
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:38,125
His forces are nothing to be scared of!

99
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,500
Separate this zone from the others.

100
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,250
We must keep the monsters here.

101
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes.

102
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:46,167
Run!

103
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:48,333
Leave this area and find shelter!

104
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,375
Decouple the link now!

105
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:50,333
Yes!

106
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,000
It's time for the catfolks

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,958
to show their might!

108
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:00,875
A knight of the Abyss King.

109
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,583
I've heard rumours about it.

110
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:06,000
It should be a worthy opponent.

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,625
I've been so bored after fighting the weak

112
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,250
for so long.

113
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,333
Granart!

114
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,917
Watch and learn!

115
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,125
I need to figure out a way
to deal with his flame.

116
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,875
All right. This should work.

117
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,333
Wind magic!

118
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,000
Ouch...

119
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:44,042
I thought the wind was strong enough
to put out the flame.

120
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,167
I can take it from here.

121
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:48,250
Don't be silly.

122
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,042
Your sword can't even cut that thing.

123
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:53,125
Indeed.

124
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,625
But I'm not going to give up just yet.

125
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,917
My people

126
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:03,292
are descendants of the warriors
who fought alongside the Ring King.

127
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,458
Since you are the Ring King
of this generation,

128
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:08,708
fighting by your side

129
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,667
and protecting you until the very end

130
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,083
is our duty.

131
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,958
It doesn't matter how unreliable you are.

132
00:09:20,667 --> 00:09:22,458
Gramps says

133
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:25,958
I still can't command
the ring's magic at will.

134
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:27,667
But...

135
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,458
If I can distract that thing

136
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,792
and disperse its flame...

137
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,958
It's too risky.

138
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:39,042
I'm a total wimp compared to you, Granart.

139
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:43,375
But there is something I can do!

140
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:46,625
I get it.

141
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:48,917
Very well.

142
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:53,625
The rings are here!

143
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,208
Come and get them!

144
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,667
The rings...

145
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:01,667
Not yet.

146
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:03,500
Closer.

147
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,958
Just a bit closer.

148
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:07,917
Now!

149
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,458
Granart!

150
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:20,375
I got this!

151
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,708
Ring King, finish it!

152
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:52,292
Was the knight being controlled
by the black ring?

153
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:54,875
Princess Granart!

154
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,042
We took out all the monsters.

155
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:01,167
Well done.

156
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:02,792
Is everyone all right?

157
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:03,750
Yeah.

158
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,375
The catfolks sure are strong.

159
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:09,000
Huh? What happened to me?

160
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:17,125
Ring King.

161
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,708
It seems I underestimated you.

162
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:25,250
You may lack the strength,

163
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,458
but you possess the qualities of a king.

164
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:30,375
I acknowledge your worth.

165
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:33,708
You may become my husband.

166
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:39,583
It's inevitable.

167
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,000
This is the very reason why
Satou is working so hard.

168
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,167
No. Not yet.

169
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,458
I don't want you to recognise me.

170
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,833
I want to earn it.

171
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:54,123
Granart.

172
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,417
I'm challenging you to another fight.

173
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,542
Let me confirm once again.

174
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:06,458
The fight is over when one of us

175
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,083
is unable to battle.

176
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,250
Brace yourself!

177
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,167
From the right...

178
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,375
It came from the left!

179
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,125
Satou, calm down!

180
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,708
It's not over yet.

181
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,500
Why are you even doing this?

182
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,625
She's already agreed to give you the ring.

183
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,667
You're such a fool.

184
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,292
Princess Krystal, won't you cheer for him?

185
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:41,292
Lord Satou is fighting for your sake.

186
00:12:44,417 --> 00:12:46,750
For me?

187
00:12:48,042 --> 00:12:50,500
Use the rings.

188
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,542
Are you going easy on me?

189
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:54,458
No.

190
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:58,750
The rings are power
I'm borrowing from Hime and Nephrites.

191
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,125
It's not my own power.

192
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,583
Even if it helped me win,

193
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:07,583
I'm still the pathetic man who's lost
in front of the girl he likes.

194
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:11,667
I'm trying to be the cool guy

195
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:13,585
for the wife I love!

196
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,875
He really is

197
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,125
a big oaf.

198
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:22,500
Satou!

199
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:25,667
If you defeat Granart,

200
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,375
I'll have sex with you as your reward!

201
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,625
Yeah!

202
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,000
How amusing.

203
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,333
You are an amusing man.

204
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:48,417
I'll assist you in this fight.

205
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:50,708
This voice is coming from the ring.

206
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:55,417
I'll see through her next move.

207
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,417
Focus on my voice.

208
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,333
Doing so

209
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,583
will let you act faster than her
in a split second.

210
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:04,458
But that's...

211
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,125
Don't worry.

212
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,292
This isn't the power
of the Ring Princesses.

213
00:14:09,208 --> 00:14:11,958
Consider this an opportunity
you've earned yourself.

214
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,500
I don't quite get it,
but I know what to do.

215
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:16,333
Very well.

216
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,042
What's wrong?

217
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:24,083
Are you shocked by her cheer?

218
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,958
Brace yourself!

219
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:30,417
She disappeared!

220
00:14:30,417 --> 00:14:31,333
Above you.

221
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,542
What?

222
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,833
Satou!

223
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,292
He did it!

224
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,292
Lord Satou is amazing!

225
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:58,375
He actually won.

226
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,958
What was that just now?

227
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,417
What...

228
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:23,833
Great work, Ring King.

229
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,083
You're the first to have defeated me.

230
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:31,583
I must give you
the recognition you deserve.

231
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,250
All right. Let's make a baby.

232
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:40,667
In Needakitta,

233
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:43,458
the winner has the utmost respect.

234
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:46,625
The defeated must
serve the winner wholeheartedly.

235
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,083
Hold on...

236
00:15:48,792 --> 00:15:52,042
I'll ask my servant to get things ready.

237
00:15:52,042 --> 00:15:52,875
Wait.

238
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,083
Why should we wait?

239
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,583
I'm already your wife.

240
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:04,833
Are you saying my body
isn't good enough for you?

241
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:06,792
No.

242
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,125
I already have
a promise with someone else.

243
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,042
Hime and I made a promise.

244
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Satou did great.

245
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,083
This is his reward.

246
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:35,833
We are husband and wife anyway.
It's something we do.

247
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,833
Hime. Can we...

248
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,250
Satou?

249
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,958
get down to business?

250
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,542
I'm going to let him have his way with me.

251
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,333
All right, Satou.

252
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,500
Let's do it.

253
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:05,125
Satou?

254
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:11,208
Hime's boobs...

255
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,417
I see.

256
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,417
He used the rings' power

257
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,250
and fought so hard.

258
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,542
You looked cool today, Satou.

259
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,958
Good morning.

260
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,667
My darling.

261
00:17:49,292 --> 00:17:50,875
When did I fall asleep?

262
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:56,167
You were so feisty last night, Satou.

263
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,208
What...

264
00:17:57,917 --> 00:17:59,458
I don't remember a thing.

265
00:18:02,292 --> 00:18:04,958
Nothing happened last night.

266
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,167
Nephrites!?

267
00:18:07,542 --> 00:18:11,042
I was awake and watching the whole time.

268
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:13,042
After all, it's my turn next.

269
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,167
Your turn?

270
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,542
After her, it's my turn!

271
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:17,917
Granart was here too?

272
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,042
Princess Granart, it's time.

273
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:22,083
All right.

274
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:23,417
You should be there too.

275
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:26,458
We are holding a wedding.

276
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,583
The people of Needakitta

277
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,917
have returned to the Ring King

278
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,417
and become his fellow warriors once again!

279
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,417
She finally found the right man.

280
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:50,375
I was worried
she'd never find a good suitor.

281
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,542
Ring King.

282
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:55,625
You said you wanted
to earn my recognition.

283
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,458
I'm glad you said it.

284
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:03,458
So...

285
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,625
I know.

286
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,583
You read my movement perfectly.

287
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,083
It wasn't a coincidence.

288
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,708
That was something else.

289
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,375
Your victory

290
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:19,125
is the result of your determination.

291
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,208
That's all that I need.

292
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:40,583
Hime!

293
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:45,250
Why did you gulp down the whole cup?

294
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:48,000
How should I know?

295
00:19:51,292 --> 00:19:52,417
Satou.

296
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:57,125
Stop making me worry.

297
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,708
I was really happy at that moment.

298
00:20:06,042 --> 00:20:07,958
You cheered for me.

299
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:13,250
But I want to finish that thing with you

300
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,458
after I'm back in my world.

301
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:21,708
This world is too unusual for me.

302
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,750
If we are to develop this relationship,

303
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,208
I want us to carry on

304
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:27,500
in my world.

305
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,792
Satou...

306
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,125
I don't think it's right

307
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,917
to use this as a substitute
or a means to love.

308
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,458
Thanks.

309
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,375
It's a relief to hear that.

310
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,375
However...

311
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:48,375
I still want to reward you
for your hard work.

312
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,000
Is there anything you want to do

313
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,208
or want me to do?

314
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,667
I can grant you one wish.

315
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,542
I want...

316
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,042
I want to touch your boobs.

317
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:12,375
I want to touch your boobs
to my heart's content!

318
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:18,042
I... I guess it can't be helped.

319
00:21:18,042 --> 00:21:20,250
Satou, you're a perv.

320
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,708
Can I?

321
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:22,833
Fine. Go ahead.

322
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,250
Granart!

323
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,208
Nephrites!

324
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,708
I can't stand it! You're taking too long!

325
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:43,292
I'm already 18 years old.

326
00:21:43,292 --> 00:21:46,875
Most of my people
get married before that age.

327
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,583
-Stop making me wait.
-Princess Krystal, look at that.

328
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,958
Cat powder!?

329
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,417
I don't mind how we do it
as long as we do it.

330
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:09,208
That is how the Ring King
still remains a virgin.
