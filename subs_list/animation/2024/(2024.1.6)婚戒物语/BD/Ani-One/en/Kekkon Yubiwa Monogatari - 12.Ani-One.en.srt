1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,292
Is this the Idanokan Palace?

2
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:18,375
We actually made it back?

3
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,500
It's too dark to see anything in here.

4
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,083
Amber?

5
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,458
No monsters in the vicinity.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,750
No signs of life either.

7
00:00:35,625 --> 00:00:37,042
Do you feel lonely?

8
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,250
Stay sharp. I smell blood.

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,042
I think I'm going to be blind!

10
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,000
Is this better?

11
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:12,125
These are armours of empire soldiers.

12
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,000
They must have fought monsters here.

13
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:18,250
They didn't have time to mourn their dead.

14
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:21,125
The battle must have been intense.

15
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:25,417
Perhaps the world is already...

16
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:30,625
What's wrong?

17
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:41,167
Go!

18
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:43,000
The empire's soldiers!

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,542
They are still fighting.

20
00:01:45,542 --> 00:01:46,833
Satou, use that.

21
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,375
Satou?

22
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:53,417
I know.

23
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,375
The Abyss King...

24
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:17,292
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

25
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,625
Go down from here.

26
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,583
You can approach the demon army
from the side.

27
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,458
Use the element of surprise
to take down the Abyss King.

28
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:53,417
Yes.

29
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:55,167
Satou.

30
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:56,208
Don't worry.

31
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:58,250
We have all the rings.

32
00:03:58,917 --> 00:04:00,375
I have you with me.

33
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,583
It all happened sooner than expected,

34
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:05,125
but this is the reason we came back.

35
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,542
I'm counting on you, Ring King.

36
00:04:12,167 --> 00:04:14,542
I'm betting all my hopes on you.

37
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:18,458
You can do it, Lord Satou.

38
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,542
Yeah.

39
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,167
You're our best hope, Ring King.

40
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:33,000
Satou.

41
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,667
I'll be waiting for you.

42
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,083
Yes.

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,167
I'll be right back.

44
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,042
You finally came.

45
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,500
Heir of the rings.

46
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,833
You've done well,

47
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,500
New King.

48
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,792
Young man,

49
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:44,333
combine the power.

50
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,208
Incredible.

51
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,042
Do not show any mercy.

52
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:56,958
He did it.

53
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,458
No.

54
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,875
This can't be happening.

55
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,958
How come?

56
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,708
The rings are the truth of this world.

57
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,042
The Abyss must be destroyed.

58
00:07:16,042 --> 00:07:19,708
The world shall have salvation.

59
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,000
Am I not worthy enough?

60
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:27,917
Satou!

61
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,875
Heir of the rings.

62
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:37,083
You are also a puppet who knows nothing.

63
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,583
No...

64
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:41,417
This can't be right!

65
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,792
Our duty...

66
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,833
and the legends, do they mean nothing?

67
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,167
I'm going to fight.

68
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:51,500
We can't lose Satou here.

69
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:00,458
Don't worry.

70
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,000
I won't let him die.

71
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:10,625
All those stories
about being too weak to move a finger

72
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,250
are true, after all.

73
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,500
Return to the Abyss!

74
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,750
Women who wield the rings...

75
00:08:48,542 --> 00:08:51,417
What are you doing here?

76
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,125
We can't just watch you die.

77
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:28,083
Granart!

78
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,708
Darn it! Let me go!

79
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,875
We are outnumbered.

80
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:03,042
Satou!

81
00:10:03,042 --> 00:10:04,083
Lord Satou!

82
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,833
Sorry, everyone.

83
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:08,833
Satou!

84
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,375
Hime...

85
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,292
Satou, good morning.

86
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:42,083
Hime?

87
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:44,417
Good morning.

88
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,625
Do you promise

89
00:10:52,625 --> 00:10:55,333
to be true to her
in sickness and in health

90
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,167
and love her

91
00:10:57,167 --> 00:11:00,458
and honour her all days of your life?

92
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,333
I do.

93
00:12:02,292 --> 00:12:03,625
Gramps.

94
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,917
You're finally awake, Satou.

95
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:09,875
I see.

96
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,250
Am I dead?

97
00:12:12,042 --> 00:12:14,167
Don't be silly.

98
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,292
We're not dead yet.

99
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,208
What is going on?

100
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:23,542
Master Alabaster saved us.

101
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:25,333
Well done, Great Sage.

102
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,125
Give me a break, you're exaggerating.

103
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:31,125
I used up all of my strength

104
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:35,042
just to create an opening between you
and the Abyss King.

105
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:40,333
We can't afford
to lose the rings just yet.

106
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:42,958
That's right!

107
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:45,750
If you made it out alive, is Mr. Marse...

108
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,000
Prince Marse is alive.

109
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:53,333
You must thank her for everything.

110
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,125
It's you...

111
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,250
It's been a while, Ring King.

112
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,833
I'm from the royal family of Lomka,

113
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:05,000
Princess Sumaragdi Lomka.

114
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,250
Thanks to Sumaragdi,

115
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:14,208
we managed to break through
the Abyssal Creatures' ranks and escape.

116
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:19,417
I've been secretly
protecting Master Alabaster.

117
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:23,042
When I saw danger closing in on him,

118
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:24,958
I got anxious.

119
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,583
And because of that,

120
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:31,042
I had the chance to help Master Alabaster.

121
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,500
He gave my life

122
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,583
such a wonderful purpose.

123
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,833
He truly is...

124
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:46,667
The monsters have retreated.

125
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:50,750
The Abyss King must have suffered
great damage as well.

126
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,875
So, the attack wasn't completely useless.

127
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,417
Don't be ridiculous.

128
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,958
You did great back there.

129
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,708
None of us could have landed a hit on him.

130
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,208
Splendid work, Satou.

131
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:09,708
Great Sage,

132
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:13,250
how is the overall situation now?

133
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,083
Soon after your departure,

134
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:19,333
the Abyss King's army
began launching assaults.

135
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:23,792
The empire's army tried to
hold them off at the mountain range.

136
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:26,167
Even I went in to assist them.

137
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:27,667
But not much could be done.

138
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,833
We could only run from the monsters.

139
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:30,833
What about Marsa?

140
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,917
How is Marsa now?

141
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:37,583
Every nation
is holding its ground gallantly.

142
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,708
Marsa will be fine.

143
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,333
Prince Marse is there to help.

144
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,667
But not only is the number
of monsters not decreasing,

145
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:48,667
more are pouring in.

146
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:51,000
Things will get worse.

147
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,500
Thankfully, I never abandoned my hope.

148
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,625
You are finally back.

149
00:14:59,542 --> 00:15:02,417
Master Alabaster, it's almost daybreak.

150
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,583
The return of the Ring King.

151
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,292
All the princesses are here.

152
00:15:08,292 --> 00:15:11,750
It's a dawn of hope ahead of us.

153
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,375
The Ring King is back!

154
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,542
The five princesses are with him, too.

155
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:30,125
There are monsters everywhere.
We are trapped here.

156
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,000
But you are back, Ring King.

157
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Everything will be all right.

158
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes. You can count on me.

159
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:40,292
I will save this world!

160
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,833
Well,

161
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:48,833
time to discuss our course of action.

162
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,000
Before that,

163
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,958
please explain yourself.

164
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,042
I thought we could
defeat the Abyss King by collecting

165
00:15:56,042 --> 00:15:57,375
all the rings.

166
00:15:57,375 --> 00:16:00,083
"STARES"
Well... I mean...

167
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,542
Gramps, level with me.

168
00:16:03,542 --> 00:16:06,000
Do I lack the strength?

169
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,333
I think I know why Satou

170
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:11,583
couldn't defeat the Abyss King.

171
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,042
The black rings the Abyss King was wearing

172
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:19,500
were never mentioned in any tales.

173
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,083
Black rings?

174
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,375
Pretty much
like a black copy of our rings.

175
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,792
They don't exist in my records.

176
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,917
The dwarves
were unaware of their existence.

177
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:34,208
But based on all the sources,

178
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:38,750
we can confirm that
the Ring King sealed the Abyss King away.

179
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,125
However, I have no idea
how much power is needed

180
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,208
to accomplish that.

181
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,458
Well? What should we do now?

182
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,875
There is only one way.

183
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,375
Figure out a way to unleash the greater
power of the rings before the next fight!

184
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:54,583
In other words,

185
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:59,458
Satou must strengthen
his bonds with the Ring Princesses.

186
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:01,417
Strengthening of bonds...

187
00:17:01,417 --> 00:17:02,875
Does that mean...

188
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,125
We're making babies.

189
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:06,667
That's one way to do it.

190
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,333
Seriously?

191
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:09,792
Satou!

192
00:17:09,792 --> 00:17:11,250
Mr. Marse!

193
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,375
What are you doing here?

194
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,917
I heard that you were coming back,

195
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:17,417
so I came.

196
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:18,833
I want to see you guys again,

197
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,167
even for just a brief moment.

198
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,125
All right, time to get down to business.

199
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,292
Legend has it that the Ring King
and the Ring Princesses

200
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:32,750
went into the battle together.

201
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:36,417
To unleash the power of the rings,

202
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,458
you need the spirit to fight as one

203
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,917
and the strength to match that spirit.

204
00:17:40,917 --> 00:17:43,458
That could be the key to everything.

205
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,833
Strength...

206
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:48,833
I don't know
about Saphir, Amber, and myself, but...

207
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,042
The two of us can't really fight.

208
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,583
That's the problem.

209
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:58,083
You must acquire the strength
befitting the Ring King's wife.

210
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,958
Yes, that means training is needed.

211
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:05,417
In other words, bridal training!

212
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:15,250
The Ring King's bedroom is this way.

213
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,542
The princesses are ready for you.

214
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,667
Satou mustered the determination

215
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:35,250
to return to this world
and fight for all of us.

216
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,292
Therefore, we must be determined as well.

217
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:43,375
Ring King,
rest well and replenish your strength.

218
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,958
Here, start with the lady you like.

219
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,542
Of course, I don't mind if everyone joins.

220
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:51,667
What now?

221
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:54,125
Isn't it every man's dream
to have a harem?

222
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:58,208
See? The Ring King looks troubled.

223
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,875
Such is the nature of a catfolk
who doesn't understand emotions.

224
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:04,083
"FURIOUS"
What?

225
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:04,958
What did you say?

226
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:08,000
You're just a pipsqueak
who got overtaken by the little sister!

227
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,875
Huh?

228
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,083
Saphira has nothing to do with this.

229
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,583
See? I was right!

230
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,250
Keep your voice down.

231
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,750
I'm not yelling!

232
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,458
Bridal training, huh?

233
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,792
You look quite happy.

234
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,708
Nah.

235
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,333
You've done so much for me,

236
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,042
I should do the same for you.

237
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,500
Could that be...

238
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:47,375
My family consisted of my parents, me,

239
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,042
and my little sister.

240
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:53,083
My sister was left in this world.

241
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,875
We haven't seen each other in ten years.

242
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,708
My parents rest here now.

243
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:04,625
Father, Mother, I am home.

244
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,208
I was too young at the time.

245
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:10,208
I could barely remember their faces.

246
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,583
But they sacrificed themselves

247
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:15,458
to save me.

248
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,167
This man over here

249
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,625
is my husband.

250
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,958
Thank you, Satou.

251
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,292
I am here again,

252
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:32,708
thanks to you.

253
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,958
Krystal.

254
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,917
Gramps, when did you get here?

255
00:20:41,917 --> 00:20:45,292
"Father, Mother, I am home."

256
00:20:45,292 --> 00:20:45,750
That's when.

257
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,375
You were here all along!

258
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:50,542
It's nothing to feel embarrassed about.

259
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:53,250
It's a touching story.

260
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:57,708
By the way, let's talk about
the magic training.

261
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,625
I'll give it my best. Please train me.

262
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,000
No, I'm not here to train you.

263
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,375
I found the perfect mentor for you.

264
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,583
She should be here very soon.

265
00:21:14,042 --> 00:21:15,125
What is that?

266
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:31,833
It's you.

267
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,417
Not bad.

268
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,333
My name is Morion Ravri Nokanatika.

269
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:46,542
Please to see you, Sister.

270
00:21:47,917 --> 00:21:49,542
And you too,

271
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,708
Brother-in-law.

272
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:54,250
Brother-in-law?

273
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:59,750
Morion Ravri Nokanatika...

274
00:22:01,292 --> 00:22:02,458
You're Hime's...

275
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,917
little sister!
