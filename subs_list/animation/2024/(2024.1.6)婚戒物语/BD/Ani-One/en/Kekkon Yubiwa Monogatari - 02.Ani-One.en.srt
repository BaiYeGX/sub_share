1
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:09,458
No!

2
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:19,625
Ring King!

3
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:21,292
Go to safety now!

4
00:00:21,292 --> 00:00:22,250
Yes!

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,625
This is the third I've taken down.

6
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:27,333
Its power ran out
after a few swings last time.

7
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:32,208
It's thanks to
Her Highness' kiss earlier.

8
00:00:32,208 --> 00:00:34,542
The power of the bond
between the two of you

9
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:37,750
is the power source of the ring.

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,708
It's the princess' duty to power
the Ring King's campaign.

11
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,750
That was why Hime...

12
00:00:47,625 --> 00:00:49,292
But it's too challenging for you

13
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:51,625
to maintain the power for too long.

14
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,625
But don't worry.

15
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,417
I'll assist you along the way.

16
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:58,625
Speaking of that, are you
actually very strong, Gramps?

17
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,750
They called you Great Sage Asparagus...

18
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,167
It's Alabaster!

19
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:07,250
What was that?

20
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,292
An enemy unlike any other.

21
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,292
The Ring of Light...

22
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,708
Ring King...

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,417
That figure...

24
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:20,833
It can't be!

25
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:23,000
Knight of the Abyss King!

26
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,208
Hime gave me the power to protect her.

27
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,458
I can keep going!

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,625
No!

29
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:33,542
What's with that wind?

30
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:40,375
This hurts a lot.

31
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:43,875
But I'm still alive.
Did the ring's power save me?

32
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,458
Satou, run for your life!

33
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:46,042
Huh!?

34
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:47,792
Stop yapping! Go!

35
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:48,917
What's the deal now?

36
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:01,208
They sent in some nasty monsters.

37
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:05,125
It's evident
they fear the Ring King's power.

38
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,083
What was that thing?

39
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,958
I can't even close in on it.

40
00:02:10,583 --> 00:02:12,625
That was the Knight of the Abyss King.

41
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:16,083
It's a terrifying monster
capable of commanding powerful magic!

42
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:17,000
Magic!?

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,583
Can't we fight that with the ring's power?

44
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,167
Save that conversation for later.

45
00:02:21,167 --> 00:02:22,958
I'll buy us some time.

46
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:31,417
Incredible. What was that?

47
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:38,167
The control of mana with the power of will
that abides by the philosophy of nature.

48
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:39,833
In other words, it's magic.

49
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:42,417
All right. Go through here.

50
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:44,208
Gramps.

51
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:52,125
Darn it! It got ahead of us!

52
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,708
The prince?

53
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:02,542
Quick!

54
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:03,958
There is a carriage on the other side.

55
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,125
Hold on. Are you asking us
to flee from the castle?

56
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,500
Hime is still inside!

57
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,292
You need not worry about that.

58
00:03:10,292 --> 00:03:11,833
Come with me now.

59
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,542
I'm so glad you're safe.

60
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,667
Hime...

61
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,958
Monsters managed to seize
the southern tower as well.

62
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,042
I took it upon myself
to bring the princess to safety

63
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:36,375
before she was in danger.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,875
Thanks for getting us out.

65
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,333
You are...

66
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:45,750
My name is Marmarugias Gisaras.

67
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,500
The Second Prince of the Gisaras Empire,

68
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,042
the neighbouring country of Nokanatika.

69
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:54,958
Ma... Mar... Marugias...

70
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,583
Anyway, thanks.

71
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,167
You can call me Marse.

72
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:04,083
More importantly, Great Sage,

73
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:06,167
will the kingdom be all right?

74
00:04:06,917 --> 00:04:09,917
At the moment,
the Abyss King is going after

75
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,708
the Ring King and his ring.

76
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:14,292
When he knows we've left the castle,

77
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,375
the monsters will start searching for us.

78
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,958
There should be no other casualties.

79
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,875
However...

80
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,417
Without the power of light,

81
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:27,458
it's almost impossible to defeat a foe
like the knight of the Abyss King.

82
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:31,667
Doesn't that mean
I have to be the one to defeat it?

83
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,958
We are now on the run

84
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,708
because you still lack the power.

85
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,083
What do you mean I lack the power?

86
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:44,917
As the Ring King,
your power is still very faint.

87
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:48,042
For your full power to manifest,

88
00:04:48,042 --> 00:04:51,208
you must gather the other four rings.

89
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,542
Four more rings...

90
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:56,458
I thought this was a wedding ring!

91
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,458
In other words...

92
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,583
Correct. Your next mission

93
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,208
is to marry the other four princesses

94
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,750
and receive their rings!

95
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,375
Isn't that polygamy?

96
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,833
That's the duty of the Ring King.

97
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:18,625
There's nothing to worry about.

98
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,833
Well? Isn't this exciting?

99
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,083
There are five princesses in total.

100
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,208
-Wait! Hold on!
-This is a man's greatest dream!

101
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:28,125
No! I'm already married to Hime.

102
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:31,583
I'm not interested in that at all.

103
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:49,167
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,667
There are only two rooms available.

105
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:09,000
The men will stay in one.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,250
It's not safe
to leave Krystal in the room all alone.

108
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll share a room with her...

109
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,917
No way.

110
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:18,542
Ouch!

111
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:23,125
In that case,
you and your husband can take a room.

112
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:32,083
All right. Before we move on tomorrow,

113
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,208
let me brief you on the true duty

114
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:39,000
of the legendary Ring King.

115
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,083
Long ago,

116
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:48,667
the Abyss King intended to make this world
submit to his dark power.

117
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:53,000
Endless hordes of monsters attack,
bringing great torment to the people.

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,208
Many countries perished
amidst the looming doom.

119
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:01,167
To repel this force of darkness,

120
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:04,167
the Ring King created rings
infused with magical power.

121
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:10,167
Each ring commands an element:
Light, fire, water, wind, and earth.

122
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:12,375
Five rings, five different powers.

123
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,583
The Ring King used their powers

124
00:08:15,583 --> 00:08:19,917
to seal the Abyss King away
after an extensive battle for survival.

125
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:23,708
The five rings

126
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:26,750
were handed over to his five wives

127
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,208
and brought back
to their respective five countries,

128
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:32,458
and have been passed down for generations,

129
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:37,833
becoming five wedding rings that prove
the princesses' bond with the Ring King.

130
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:42,333
Now, the Abyss King has been resurrected.

131
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,042
He is slowly regaining his power.

132
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,958
The Ring King's duty

133
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,667
is to collect all five rings
from the five princesses

134
00:08:51,667 --> 00:08:55,875
so he can seal
the Abyss King away with their powers.

135
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,625
The Ring King's duty...

136
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,375
Don't be concerned
about what he said earlier.

137
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,417
Don't overthink.

138
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:10,417
Our marriage is only for show anyway.

139
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,792
But I...

140
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,000
Satou?

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,167
Did I get hurt in the fight?

142
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,417
I thought the ring protected me.

143
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,875
Take it off.

144
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,958
Isn't it too quick to jump to this part?

145
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,917
Now is not the time to fool around!

146
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,000
This is all my fault.

147
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,750
No. I got injured
because I got carried away.

148
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,042
No.

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,500
It was my fault for choosing you.

150
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:43,792
Hime!

151
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,250
Hime!

152
00:09:53,542 --> 00:09:54,833
Where did she go?

153
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:00,542
Mr. Marse.

154
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,500
What's the matter?

155
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,625
Did you see Hime coming through?

156
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,833
Princess Krystal ran past me just now.

157
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,500
I see.

158
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,208
The Ring King and the Ring Princesses.

159
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,083
It's a heavy burden to bear.

160
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,250
It is natural you'd feel overwhelmed.

161
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,583
No, it's not that bad...

162
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,125
In fact, I have to thank you.

163
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:34,792
To be honest with you,
it was a relief to be freed from my duty

164
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,083
as the Ring King.

165
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:40,167
You followed her to this world

166
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:41,500
to win her back, right?

167
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,625
She must mean a lot to you.

168
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:47,250
Not really, I was only...

169
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,833
You left your life behind

170
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,917
in pursuit of love.

171
00:10:57,083 --> 00:10:58,917
It's not easy.

172
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,792
Take pride in that.

173
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,333
Sorry, I took up too much of your time.

174
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,292
She should be in the backyard up ahead.

175
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:10,958
Thanks.

176
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,042
Thank you!

177
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,792
I wish

178
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:23,250
I could have his courage.

179
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,667
Satou...

180
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,667
I...

181
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,333
I like you, Hime.

182
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:47,208
And I don't mean our friendship.

183
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,792
I really like you.

184
00:11:52,833 --> 00:11:54,708
I am here

185
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,500
because of my own decision.

186
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,417
I chose this.

187
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,625
You shouldn't blame yourself
for our circumstances.

188
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,833
You've made up your mind.

189
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,250
I've been so frustrated.

190
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,375
I wanted to forget my life as Hime Nonaka

191
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:20,000
and fulfil my duty
as the Princess of Light.

192
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,042
For the fate of this world,

193
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,667
I was willing
to marry a complete stranger

194
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,500
and make even greater sacrifices.

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,125
But when you followed me to this world,

196
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:35,792
I love every bit of that resolve.

197
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:41,958
All because I finally had the chance
to marry someone I really liked.

198
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:48,750
With that said,
my husband is the Ring King.

199
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,708
He gets hurt in battle.

200
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,958
He's obligated to marry other princesses.

201
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:59,125
I don't want to
see the man I like go through these.

202
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,083
Hime...

203
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,292
Sorry. I...

204
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:07,042
I've been too selfish.

205
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,083
No, that's not it.

206
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,250
I have to change.

207
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:17,250
I'll make up my mind this time.

208
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:20,417
This marriage shouldn't be just a sham.

209
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,542
I want to be your real wife

210
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:25,042
and help you
fulfil your duty as the Ring King.

211
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:27,375
Hime...

212
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,458
Satou...

213
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:35,792
Will you take me as your real wife?

214
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,292
Yes.

215
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,417
-What now?
-What now?

216
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,708
After everything we said just now...

217
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:56,125
It suddenly got so arousing.

218
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:57,667
Satou!

219
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:58,792
Yes?

220
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:03,792
I'm ready to be a real wife.

221
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:23,292
Can I... really do this?

222
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:25,708
Though I've longed for this moment,

223
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,667
but this feels...

224
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:38,792
Satou...

225
00:14:38,792 --> 00:14:40,042
What's wrong?

226
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,375
No.

227
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:45,292
This isn't the way to do it.

228
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:52,083
Our first time
should be much sweeter than this!

229
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:53,375
Huh!?

230
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:57,125
It's wrong
to simply go along with the mood!

231
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:59,167
My ten years' worth of love for you

232
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,417
shouldn't be like this!

233
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:03,958
I don't get it. You sound gross.

234
00:15:05,875 --> 00:15:07,792
In other words,

235
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:10,167
this isn't like us at all.

236
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:14,625
We suddenly went from
childhood friends to a married couple.

237
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,708
We can take our time to do

238
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,083
what a married couple does.

239
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:22,417
You have a point.

240
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,500
Well? Did you sleep well last night?

241
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,000
Safe and sound.

242
00:15:38,792 --> 00:15:40,750
No way I could sleep after that!

243
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,292
Are you serious?

244
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:46,792
Did nothing happen afterwards?

245
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:49,375
The mood was perfect at the moment.

246
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,042
You two are no fun!

247
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:52,417
Did you see everything?

248
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,167
Sorry, I misspoke.

249
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:59,125
It's the bond. That's the source
of the Ring King's power.

250
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:06,583
It's a good thing
your bond has been strengthened.

251
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,208
Good morning to both of you.

252
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,333
It seems the problem has been solved.

253
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,375
Here, put this on.

254
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:20,125
Your clothes from the other world
are too conspicuous here.

255
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,167
Time to move on.

256
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,792
First, we are visiting the elves' tribe,

257
00:16:27,792 --> 00:16:29,958
the nation of knowledge known as

258
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:32,000
Lomka of the Wind.

259
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,708
Elves?
Like the people with pointy ears?

260
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:37,208
Correct.

261
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:41,083
The Ring of Wind is
the heirloom of the elven royal family.

262
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:46,042
Besides, the elves are a race of beauty!

263
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,917
Did that get your excited?

264
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,167
Well, Satou?

265
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:50,917
Not at all.

266
00:16:50,917 --> 00:16:52,792
Grandpa, stop it.

267
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:55,125
I'm your only real wife!

268
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,667
I know.

269
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:58,583
Do you really?

270
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,417
Don't worry.

271
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:02,208
Unbelievable. Do you really understand?

272
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,208
The Ring King...

273
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,000
A man from the other world...

274
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:12,417
Utterly disgusting.

275
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:19,208
Deep within the valley

276
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,125
is the homeland of the beautiful
and intelligent race of elves.

277
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:27,083
Long ago, this is the nexus of knowledge
from across the world.

278
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,708
It was a sacred place.

279
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,250
But 50 years ago,

280
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,500
Lomka was surrounded by a barrier
of gusts that came out of nowhere.

281
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:44,958
This barrier of gust has stopped

282
00:17:44,958 --> 00:17:46,708
the invasions from other races.

283
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,833
This nation is nothing
like what it used to be.

284
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,417
Grandpa, have you been here before?

285
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:54,958
That was a long time ago.

286
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:59,208
The barrier wasn't here when I came.

287
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:08,667
What is this thing?

288
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:10,917
Is this the Abyss King's monster?

289
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,375
No, this is a beast from the forest.

290
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,708
You can think of it as a bear.

291
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,958
What? It's just a bear?

292
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,833
So, this is just a wild animal.

293
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,208
It's probably not dangerous...

294
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,417
You fool!

295
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:30,125
What kind of fool would
approach a wild animal like that?

296
00:18:30,125 --> 00:18:32,625
A bear from the forest
can just be dangerous too!

297
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,250
I'm so sorry!

298
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Oh no.

299
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,958
There's nowhere to run.

300
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,208
Over here!

301
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,833
The bear flew away.

302
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,750
Who are you people?

303
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,792
What are you humans doing here?

304
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:59,417
Long and pointy ears...

305
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:00,708
Are they...

306
00:19:01,417 --> 00:19:05,583
Sons of the Wind, thank you for saving us.

307
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:07,167
We are...

308
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:09,042
I am the Ring King.

309
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,875
I've come for your princess.

310
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,750
Hold on, Satou.

311
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,542
Not all nations with rings
are willing to join our cause.

312
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,417
Is that so?

313
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,042
The Ring King... I see.

314
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:26,333
We've heard the rumours.

315
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,125
Very well. We'll take you to the palace.

316
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,042
However,
things probably won't go as you wish.

317
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,833
To reach Lomka,

318
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,875
you must pass through
the roots of this giant tree.

319
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,458
Isn't this kind of inconvenient?

320
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:45,250
It's a safety measure.

321
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,708
Only smaller creatures
can pass through it.

322
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,542
That will minimise the damage.

323
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,667
Stronger monsters
will be faltered by the gust barrier.

324
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:54,250
It's pretty good at its job.

325
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,292
This is the Lomka,
the nation of the Ring of Wind.

326
00:20:14,917 --> 00:20:19,000
I wonder what kind of person
the elven princess is.

327
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,583
What she is like doesn't really matter.

328
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,750
I must collect the rings
for the sake of this world.

329
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,375
Nothing comes before that.

330
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Huh?

331
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,083
There's no one here.

332
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,208
She is hiding behind the throne!

333
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,958
Is that the princess we're looking for?

334
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,875
She seems very wary of us.

335
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,583
Ye... Yeah.

336
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:59,417
Are you the Ring King?

337
00:20:59,417 --> 00:21:00,250
Yes!

338
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,458
I am the hero from another world, Satou!

339
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,833
The other world!?

340
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:05,958
Yes!

341
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:12,958
Aren't you married?

342
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:19,708
Does that mean... you've done it?

343
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,417
Well...

344
00:21:23,292 --> 00:21:25,792
S...

345
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,667
That's the first thing she wants to know?

346
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:29,750
S...

347
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,750
We haven't gotten to that part!

348
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,542
Did you smooch?

349
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,083
That's it?

350
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,792
Well, you can put it that way.

351
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:39,292
No.

352
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:41,292
I can't waver
because of something so trivial.

353
00:21:41,917 --> 00:21:45,333
He already has the Ring of Light.

354
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:47,792
To free the world
from the evil of the Abyss King,

355
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:50,292
please abide by the tradition
and give him the ring...

356
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:52,208
This is too lewd!

357
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,625
You're asking me to
touch his lips with mine!

358
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,458
Huh!?

359
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,125
So gross...

360
00:21:58,125 --> 00:21:59,167
She ran off!

361
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,542
Ewwww...

362
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,917
Huh?

363
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:06,792
Huh?

364
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:10,042
Huh!?
