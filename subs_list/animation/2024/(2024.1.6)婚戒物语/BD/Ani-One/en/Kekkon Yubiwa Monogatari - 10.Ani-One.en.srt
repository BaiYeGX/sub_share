1
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:07,250
Oh man!
This feels like a real adventure!

2
00:00:09,583 --> 00:00:12,292
I thought so at first.

3
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:14,542
Just when will we reach the place?

4
00:00:14,542 --> 00:00:17,167
We've been walking
on the mountains for three days!

5
00:00:17,167 --> 00:00:19,458
Just a little bit more.
We're almost there.

6
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:20,667
Really?

7
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,875
Stay on your toes.

8
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,958
That'd be you
if you ever fell off the cliff.

9
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,250
Those bones are massive!

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,667
Great Sage, what are those creatures?

11
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,083
Probably monsters
from the Abyss King's era.

12
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,708
A fierce battle once took place

13
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,917
in the Kaogamika Mountains.

14
00:00:40,917 --> 00:00:43,542
I never knew
monsters of this size existed!

15
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:44,833
This is amazing!

16
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:47,875
Why did she get so excited?

17
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,375
Thanks for scouting ahead.

18
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:54,042
Anything ahead of us?

19
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:56,000
No signs of humans or monsters.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,583
Even if we get attacked,

21
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,708
you can turn into a dragon
and finish them off easily.

22
00:01:01,708 --> 00:01:05,375
You know,
that technique is very exhausting.

23
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:07,292
It depletes a lot of mana.

24
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:10,375
My hips and legs
will be sore the next day.

25
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:11,958
The others get it, right?

26
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,875
Yeah.

27
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,875
It's very tiring to use magic.

28
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,250
Hold on, are they...

29
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Muscle brain!

30
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,583
Incompetent!

31
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,167
Basement dweller!

32
00:01:24,958 --> 00:01:27,333
I wish I could go home now.

33
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,750
Come on...

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,333
There is a place not far ahead
where we can take a break.

35
00:01:33,333 --> 00:01:35,375
We'll spend the night there.

36
00:01:35,917 --> 00:01:38,417
All right. Come on, youngsters!

37
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,250
We can take a break pretty soon!

38
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,083
Fine...

39
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:55,542
Well, Gramps, you're the Great Sage.

40
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:57,833
Can you be honest with me?

41
00:01:57,833 --> 00:02:01,333
Is there any meaning
to collecting the rings?

42
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:03,792
Why do you ask?

43
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:07,125
The empire is planning
to fight the Abyss King

44
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,000
without the power of the rings.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,833
They eliminated almost all the monsters

46
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:14,250
that attacked Maasa.

47
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:19,083
It all seems different
from what I had expected.

48
00:02:20,292 --> 00:02:22,792
A hero who saved the world...

49
00:02:22,792 --> 00:02:26,458
The legendary Ring King
who defeated the Abyss King...

50
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,375
It sounds great on the surface,

51
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:32,167
but people don't really
expect anything from me.

52
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,917
You could be right.

53
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,833
It's a big world.

54
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:41,042
Different people live their lives
with different ideals.

55
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:45,542
Not everyone shares the same hope.

56
00:02:45,542 --> 00:02:48,792
If the humans can defeat monsters
without any help,

57
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:50,875
they can probably
defeat the Abyss King, too.

58
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,208
It's perfectly reasonable
to think that way.

59
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,125
Is that so?

60
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:59,083
These rings are not as trusted
by the people

61
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,375
as I thought.

62
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:02,375
However,

63
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:04,208
I've seen my fair share of the world

64
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,750
at this point.

65
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,667
There were bits and pieces,

66
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:12,708
but I've heard horrible stories
about the Abyss King,

67
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:17,042
including the scars that have endured
since the mythic age.

68
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,792
There is no telling
how powerful the Abyss King is.

69
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,875
We've seen it ourselves.

70
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:26,458
He uses terrifying powers
we can't undo with magic

71
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,000
to control his knights and monsters.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,583
That power was only a small portion
that leaked from his imprisonment.

73
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:38,917
The humans will stand
no chance against him without help.

74
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,208
All the remaining records in this world

75
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:43,292
led me to that conclusion.

76
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,083
Relax.

77
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,458
If the Abyss King comes back to life
just as the legend says,

78
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,708
so will the Ring King.

79
00:03:57,708 --> 00:04:00,750
Satou, you've collected four rings.

80
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,208
The final one might
present itself to you later on.

81
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:09,667
All right. My turn to keep watch.

82
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,042
Go and get some sleep.

83
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,000
All right.

84
00:04:18,542 --> 00:04:20,667
How can I even call myself the Great Sage?

85
00:04:21,542 --> 00:04:22,917
I'm a failure.

86
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:41,000
TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

87
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:03,667
This is the Kingdom of Earth, Idanokan.

88
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,583
The fallen dwarven city.

89
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:11,750
Everything is in ruin.

90
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:17,083
They fended off
the Abyss King's army several times.

91
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:22,667
But the final battle
seemed pretty brutal.

92
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:27,500
Before they could even rebuild their city,

93
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,417
the dwarves were gone.

94
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,667
This place really seems empty.

95
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:40,125
This silence
is sending chills down my spine.

96
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:43,333
Really? I'm quite fond of it.

97
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,250
It's great to have the place to myself.

98
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,250
I'd love to live here.

99
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,833
It'd be even better if it were warmer.

100
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,500
I'll wait here.

101
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,000
You can go on and look
for the Ring of Earth yourself.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,250
What's wrong, Princess Saphir?
Already worn out?

103
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,792
I hate wandering aimlessly.

104
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:07,292
This place is not far
from the Abyss' domain.

105
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,250
I won't help if you get in trouble.

106
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,500
Well, then. Keep me out of trouble.

107
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,292
It's a great honour.
Give it your best.

108
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,042
You are unbelievable.

109
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:21,500
I'll carry you on my back.

110
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,792
Come on. Get up.

111
00:07:24,208 --> 00:07:25,583
Huh?

112
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,917
Nope! I can walk on my own.

113
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,083
There is no need to be concerned,
shy little girl.

114
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,083
I'm not!

115
00:07:34,085 --> 00:07:35,460
Is that so?

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,250
What is it?

117
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:45,250
I think someone's here.

118
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:49,667
Perhaps you got too edgy

119
00:07:49,667 --> 00:07:52,583
from this desolation.

120
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,917
I see...

121
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:13,417
This place looks very clean.

122
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:17,083
This looks like a throne.

123
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,125
The place was probably their palace.

124
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,250
And this is...

125
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,542
Gramps! There is a corpse here!

126
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,208
Calm down, Satou.

127
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,667
That is not the body of a dwarf.

128
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:35,542
It's an automaton,
a relic of the mythic era.

129
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,042
An automaton?

130
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:39,583
Like a robot?

131
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,250
Relax.

132
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,500
It won't move without mana.

133
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,083
This is nothing but a doll.

134
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,500
The dwarven civilisation
was based around automation

135
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,375
and contraptions driven by mana.

136
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:55,250
They dig into the earth
and forge metal parts.

137
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,250
It was said that
they would sacrifice their lives

138
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,375
just to be the best craftsmen.

139
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:04,083
This is the evidence
of their existence and their technology.

140
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:07,750
Back in the war during the mythical era,

141
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,500
dwarves had already started using
automatons as weapons.

142
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,125
The moving platform of Needakitta

143
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,333
is one of the very few remaining relics.

144
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:22,333
I heard our ancestors
got it from the dwarves long ago.

145
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,625
I had no idea

146
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:26,708
how the vehicle was moved.

147
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,375
They left us
all kinds of things to discover,

148
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:33,083
but no one knows
what happened to them.

149
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:36,417
It truly was a chaotic time.

150
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:43,583
As I expected, there is nothing here
to help us locate the ring.

151
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,208
Should we check the underground tunnel?

152
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:49,417
Underground?
We have to keeping going?

153
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:57,208
Perished...

154
00:09:57,917 --> 00:10:00,208
We perished...

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,875
Everyone in the Kingdom of Earth...

156
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,917
Gramps, what is going on here?

157
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:26,000
Looks like things could
still be functional.

158
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,542
But how?

159
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:29,417
Wait, this is...

160
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,708
The Abyss King's knight!

161
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,917
He can control even machines?

162
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,250
He never ceases to surprise.

163
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:43,750
Why?

164
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:47,333
We fought on the same side.

165
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:51,500
But why were we the ones who perished?

166
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,708
Why did we have to die?

167
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:58,583
What is it talking about?

168
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:06,292
Wind, Fire, Water, and Light...
All of them shall perish!

169
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,333
You will be sent to where we are,

170
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,875
together with our lord!

171
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,833
The Abyss will devour you!

172
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:17,792
Oh no!

173
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:24,833
Satou is trapped on the other side.

174
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What is going on now?

175
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,042
Don't get in my way,
boy from another world.

176
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,667
The fate of this world
doesn't concern you.

177
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:46,292
You have no reason to fight for it.

178
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:47,625
No, you are wrong.

179
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,250
I may not come from this world,

180
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,667
but this world

181
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:56,500
has people who live in peace

182
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,417
and all of Hime's loved ones.

183
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:02,083
Are they worth risking your life for?

184
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,500
Yes.

185
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:08,000
I want to protect Hime's world.

186
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:10,625
I will defend it!

187
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:18,250
Satou!

188
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,750
Thanks, Hime.

189
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,583
You fool.

190
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,667
You are being used by the people.

191
00:12:55,667 --> 00:13:00,250
Do the dwarves hate us?

192
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,958
Who knows?

193
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,208
Maybe it said that

194
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,875
under the influence of the Abyss King.

195
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,417
It's time.

196
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,542
It's for the resurrection.

197
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:23,875
The ancient king shall come back to life!

198
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,292
What now?

199
00:13:29,292 --> 00:13:31,375
The black ring is vanishing.

200
00:13:32,917 --> 00:13:34,167
What?

201
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,958
All the black rings

202
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,042
are vanishing.

203
00:13:46,417 --> 00:13:47,708
Finally...

204
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,667
It has begun.

205
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:10,250
What is happening?

206
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:17,792
Watch out! Brace yourself!

207
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,083
Abyssal Creatures!

208
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:27,583
It's too risky to start fighting
until we know more.

209
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,042
Let's get out of here.

210
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:36,667
There are hordes of them.

211
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,000
Where are they coming from?

212
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,375
Were they summoned here?

213
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,875
But there are too many of them.

214
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,708
In that case...

215
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:47,917
Master! We need your help!

216
00:14:47,917 --> 00:14:49,125
My help?

217
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,375
Turn into a dragon and fend them off!

218
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,042
No, I can't do it.

219
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:55,875
The transformation
requires a lot of mana.

220
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,917
I can't use it on a land
with so little water-element mana.

221
00:14:58,917 --> 00:14:59,792
Are you kidding me?

222
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,125
Satou.

223
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:06,417
Get ready for combat.

224
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,792
Satou! Behind you!

225
00:15:21,042 --> 00:15:23,250
I'll cover you.

226
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,250
Thanks.

227
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:36,250
Gramps, how did this happen?

228
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,708
They just keep coming.

229
00:15:39,292 --> 00:15:42,417
There's no end to this.
There is no other way.

230
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,625
Run! This way!

231
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,708
We must get away now!

232
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,125
Are you all right?

233
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,167
I'm all right.

234
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,750
Just a bit exhausted.
All I need is a break.

235
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,417
This is bad.
His stamina depletes too quickly.

236
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:14,958
At this rate...

237
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:22,417
Unbelievable!

238
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,625
There should have been more time.

239
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,583
No. I should've known better.

240
00:16:29,417 --> 00:16:31,333
We are doomed!

241
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,833
What... What is going on now?

242
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:48,500
The Abyss King has been fully resurrected!

243
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,417
The number of monsters...

244
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,583
Without all five rings,

245
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,875
the Ring King
can't unleash his true power.

246
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,583
Battling the monsters will be futile.

247
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,625
Would the Ring King
collect all five rings first?

248
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:15,417
Would the Abyss King
come back to life before that?

249
00:17:15,417 --> 00:17:18,167
It was a gamble with this world.

250
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,875
And I lost.

251
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,292
Satou...

252
00:17:33,292 --> 00:17:35,917
Our priority now is to flee.

253
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,875
We have to find the Ring of Earth.

254
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,792
There could still be time.

255
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,250
He won't let us escape so easily.

256
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,750
No. The Abyss King will
hunt us down to the edge of the world.

257
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:54,708
He will find us.

258
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:58,583
No! What should we do now?

259
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:00,042
Don't worry.

260
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:02,708
I won't let him take your lives.

261
00:18:08,167 --> 00:18:10,333
Gramps, what are you doing?

262
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,042
Opening a portal.

263
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:16,208
The Abyss King must never
get his hands on the rings.

264
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:18,833
Gramps!

265
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:19,708
Don't come here!

266
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,917
I can take it from here.

267
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:28,458
By closing the portal,

268
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:31,208
there is no way
the Abyss King can pursue you.

269
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,750
In order for you to escape,

270
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,375
I must stay to close the portal.

271
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:38,792
If it remained open,

272
00:18:38,792 --> 00:18:41,583
our plan could be ruined.

273
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:47,250
Satou, you are my only hope.

274
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,250
Sorry we have to
say our goodbyes this way.

275
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,333
Please free the princesses
from their fate with the rings.

276
00:18:56,042 --> 00:18:58,583
Take care of Hime.

277
00:19:01,792 --> 00:19:02,833
No!

278
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,500
Gramps!

279
00:19:08,292 --> 00:19:12,625
Are you sure you want to stay?

280
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,750
I've made up my mind

281
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:17,000
to defend this world until the very end.

282
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,958
Sorry for dragging you into this mess.

283
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,125
No.

284
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,250
It's a great honour to fight by your side,

285
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,417
Great Sage.

286
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,083
That's right.

287
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,667
I remember now.

288
00:21:29,042 --> 00:21:31,708
It must feel worse for the others.

289
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:40,708
Gramps...

290
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,333
Are we really back?

291
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,083
This... This feels awful.

292
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:10,375
It doesn't fit well.

293
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:13,083
What is this thing?

294
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,375
It's a bra.

295
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,583
Try putting it on.

296
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,833
Can I?

297
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:21,250
I feel like I'm tied up.

298
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,250
This is incredible.

299
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,125
It kind of makes me nervous.

300
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:28,667
Why would you wear
something so fancy under the clothes?

301
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:30,417
Isn't it pointless?

302
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:33,625
Your underwear is not meant
to be shown to others.

303
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,417
But you do that all the time.

304
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:40,792
Well... A little bit of that
can work quite well.

305
00:22:41,583 --> 00:22:44,375
The answer to that is pretty obvious.

306
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,750
I get it now.
It's meant to seduce men.

307
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,750
What...

308
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:00,417
Hime?

309
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:09,000
A bra?

310
00:23:17,708 --> 00:23:20,667
Hey, bring me the size that fits me.

311
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:21,917
I don't have anything like that.

312
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:25,167
This shirt smells funny.

313
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,583
That belonged to Gramps!

314
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:28,667
Princess Krystal!

315
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,667
What is "free shipping?"

316
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:38,500
Satou. Good... Good morning.
