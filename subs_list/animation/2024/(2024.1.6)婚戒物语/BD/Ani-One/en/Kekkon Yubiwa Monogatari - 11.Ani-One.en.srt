FASHION STORE

2
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:03,583
I'm done getting changed.

3
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:05,083
Same here.

4
00:00:05,083 --> 00:00:06,417
Me too.

5
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:08,167
You can come out now.

6
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:13,167
How do I look?

7
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:14,833
Super cute!

8
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,125
Will this do?

9
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,917
I don't see how this is attractive.

10
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:21,917
You both look great in those outfits.

11
00:00:21,917 --> 00:00:23,167
Am I right, Satou?

12
00:00:23,167 --> 00:00:24,458
Not bad.

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,750
Cat ears and horns?

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,083
Is there an event going on?

15
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:34,000
Those things on your head
are too conspicuous.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,083
All we have to do
is to avoid drawing attention.

17
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,167
Check this out.

18
00:00:38,167 --> 00:00:40,542
This style will suit you too.

19
00:00:40,542 --> 00:00:42,500
Each of us can wear a different colour.

20
00:00:44,042 --> 00:00:46,792
-Hime is having a great time.
-It's lovely!

TALES OF WEDDING RINGS

JOOSTARS

23
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:25,125
All right, we should figure out

24
00:02:25,125 --> 00:02:27,583
how to proceed with this situation.

25
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:28,750
I get it,

26
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,708
but there's nothing left

27
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,292
where the portal of light opened.

28
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:34,167
It was difficult to pull that off.

29
00:02:34,167 --> 00:02:36,167
But the ability to cast that spell

30
00:02:36,167 --> 00:02:38,667
is what made him the Great Sage.

31
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:42,083
We can either wait for our people
to come for us

32
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:45,208
or find a way back.

33
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,667
Whichever the case,
we have no clue how to proceed.

34
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,292
We are completely helpless.

35
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:52,500
It's too early to give up.

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,708
Aren't you worried about your country?

37
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:57,792
May I take your order?

38
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:02,750
The merchant guild will decide
Needakitta's destination.

39
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,958
There's no need for me to worry.

40
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:10,375
My brother and the elder
will keep Lomka safe.

41
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:14,542
I'd spent ten years in this world.

42
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,625
What an optimistic bunch.

43
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,375
That doesn't mean I've given up.

44
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:21,042
But given our circumstances,

45
00:03:21,042 --> 00:03:23,833
we must prepare for the worst.

46
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,625
By the way,

47
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,542
all the worries don't seem to

48
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,917
affect your appetite.

49
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,542
The desserts are simply too good.

50
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:37,875
Sweet food is my favourite.

51
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,375
I hope I have enough money
to pay for this.

52
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:43,208
Don't worry, let me take care of it.

53
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,583
But I am anxious.

54
00:03:48,417 --> 00:03:50,833
Despite knowing there's nothing we can do,

55
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:54,667
I still want to find a way back.

56
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,333
But where do we even begin?

57
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,417
A place with a high density of mana

58
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:02,125
should be able to
form a connection with our world.

59
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,375
The first step is to find that place.

60
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,708
We mustered the spirit

61
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,375
but couldn't find any lead.

62
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,417
I'm actually surprised.

63
00:04:17,417 --> 00:04:19,292
There are only humans on this land

64
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,667
and no other races.

65
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:24,958
All right! I'm going to
increase the catfolk population!

66
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:26,625
I'm going to make babies with him!

67
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:27,833
Stop!

68
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:31,708
I'll find a way to leave
this extremely extraordinary land.

69
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,083
Try your best, Princess Saphir.

70
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:36,958
By the way, Krystal,

71
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:37,958
how are things going?

72
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:41,833
Weren't you going to further develop
your relationship with the Ring King?

73
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:46,333
Well, that's up to Satou.

74
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,083
You have a promise, right?

75
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,167
Huh!?

76
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,125
Well then, good night.

77
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:54,542
Good night.

78
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:59,583
The room is too cramped
for all four of us.

79
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,250
I'll be spending the night here.

80
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,500
Are you sure
we can let them be on their own?

81
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,208
They are staying next door.
Nothing to worry about.

82
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,333
So...

83
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,292
Yes?

84
00:05:17,042 --> 00:05:20,250
The bills for the clothes and food...

85
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,875
Oh...

86
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:27,417
Gramps left a letter in my room.

87
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:31,333
If you are reading this letter,

88
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:33,958
it means things didn't go as planned.

89
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,625
Sorry I can't be with you right now.

90
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:40,542
But all that matters is that you're safe.

91
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,667
There's nothing to worry about.

92
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:45,583
The house and the money are still here.

93
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,083
I made the arrangements
so you could live here when necessary.

94
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,917
Please, forget about Arnulus.

95
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:57,667
Live on and have a normal life.

96
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,042
Gramps predicted

97
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:06,500
things could end badly.

98
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:11,375
He told me not to be worried.

99
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:20,167
I thought you went abroad.

100
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:23,708
Well, something came up.

101
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,583
How did you spend your summer break?

102
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,542
Nothing special.
Some family matters.

103
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:34,042
I thought I didn't have to
come to school again.

104
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,792
A few days have passed.

105
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:43,000
Nephrites goes to the library every day

106
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,750
to learn more about our world.

107
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,292
Granart made some new friends
in the neighbourhood.

108
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:52,208
Saphir is always deep in thought.

109
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:09,000
Satou.

110
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:13,875
You've been coming here every night.

111
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't mind living here,

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,375
but I don't know
if the princesses will say the same.

113
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:25,042
Don't you remember Gramps' last words?

114
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:29,667
He wanted you to free the princesses
from their fate with the rings.

115
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:36,583
Everyone should find
their happiness in this world.

116
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,167
You too, Satou.

117
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,000
Leave the other world behind.

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,750
Let's live happily

119
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,292
in this world.

120
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:49,333
Okay?

121
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,833
To live happily...

122
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,792
Satou?

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,917
Hime.

124
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:07,917
What is that?

125
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:09,542
The shrine!

126
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:18,792
A girl came out of the shrine!

127
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,833
It's been too long.

128
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,292
I've been waiting for you.

129
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,833
We finally meet.

130
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:34,708
Ring King.

131
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:42,167
Sorry for interrupting.

132
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:42,958
I'm going back in.

133
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,708
Wait! You called me the Ring King.

134
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,792
Are you actually...

135
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,833
The guardian of the Ring of Earth,

136
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,500
Amber Idanokan.

137
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,000
A Ring Princess has been
living in our world this whole time?

138
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:12,000
Long ago, after the great battle
against the Abyss King ended,

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,333
a small number of dwarves survived.

140
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,625
The race of dwarfs
would face extinction one day,

141
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,750
and Idanokan,
the Kingdom of Earth, would fall.

142
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:26,250
To prepare for their extinction
and ensure the ring would be passed down,

143
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,125
the dwarves created
an immortal vessel for the ring.

144
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:31,875
The name was Amber.

145
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,917
Created?

146
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,875
I was a creation.

147
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:39,750
A substitute for the dwarven princess.

148
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:45,917
I was sent to this world
along with the ring.

149
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:50,750
It was an effort to ensure
the ring would not be lost

150
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,000
and was safely delivered to the Ring King.

151
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:59,083
I've been waiting for centuries.

152
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,000
And finally,

153
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:03,667
you are here.

154
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:09,083
Now, become one with me.

155
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,000
Defeat the Abyss King

156
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and bring peace to Arnulus.

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,875
No!

158
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,625
Arnulus is lost.

159
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,625
The Abyss King came back to life.

160
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,167
It was the reason we fled to this world.

161
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:24,542
We lost. Therefore,

162
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,583
Satou must never go back to that world!

163
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:32,208
Hime...

164
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,583
Is that so?

165
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,667
In other words,

166
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,542
I can't fulfil Amber's duty.

167
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,833
Come to me when you change your mind.

168
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,875
I'm used to waiting
for the man who never came.

169
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:01,875
Hey, Satou.

170
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:04,667
Can you come home early tomorrow?

171
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:07,250
Every day here is so boring.

172
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,875
I didn't do my summer homework.

173
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:13,417
I'll have to attend extra classes
for some time.

174
00:11:13,417 --> 00:11:15,542
You are our husband.

175
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,042
You should spend more time

176
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,500
with us.

177
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,458
Yes.

178
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,958
Nephrites seems bored as well.

179
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:23,542
What about the library?

180
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,500
Well...

181
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Since I've been going there every day,
the people remember my face.

182
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,458
Now I find it a bit daunting to go there.

183
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,458
Saphir has been cooped up at home.

184
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,125
Aren't you bored?

185
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:40,667
I'm doing all right.

186
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,500
By the way, Ring King,

187
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,792
you and Krystal were out
until late night yesterday.

188
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,583
What were you doing?

189
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,875
Actually, there was...

190
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,542
We went to the convenience store.

191
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,667
Isn't that right, Satou?

192
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,417
Yeah...

193
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:08,208
Hime,

194
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,917
shouldn't we tell them about Amber?

195
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,958
Can we even make a difference
by going back?

196
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,042
Can we really defeat the Abyss King

197
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:17,875
by collecting all the rings?

198
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,167
Are you sure you can defeat
a monstrosity like that?

199
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:29,458
We must stay in this world
and find happiness.

200
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,750
We should've left the house sooner.

201
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,583
Yeah.

202
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,292
Let's run.

203
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,917
Amber! What are you doing there?

204
00:12:49,917 --> 00:12:52,667
Doing what I'm meant to do.

205
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:58,417
It's my duty to watch over the Ring King.

206
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:03,500
It's my destiny
to be found by the Ring King.

207
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:07,125
When I heard your voice last night,

208
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,958
I thought you finally came looking for me.

209
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:14,000
However, it wasn't me that you sought.

210
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,542
You were searching for the happiness

211
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:21,292
the Ring Princess of Light mentioned.

212
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,083
Welcome!

213
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,542
High quality at a low price!

214
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,000
There are carrots.

215
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Apple.

216
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,208
Amber?

217
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,500
Their apples are delicious.

218
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,292
The people running this shop

219
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:42,583
are a family that has
safeguarded the shrine for generations.

220
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:45,583
Their offerings are always
the delicious apples.

221
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,250
I never knew.

222
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:52,417
"DELICIOUS APPLES! 178 YEN EACH!"
Apples...

223
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,875
Where did she go?

224
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:16,292
I can help you return to Arnulus.

225
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,667
I was gifted with that power.

226
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,792
Form the pact of ring with me

227
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:25,000
so I can regain my power

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,667
to open a portal to Arnulus.

229
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:36,583
It's finally over.

230
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:50,292
Where is the Ring Princess of Light?

231
00:14:51,042 --> 00:14:53,833
She finished her homework and went home.

232
00:14:53,833 --> 00:14:56,292
She has people waiting for her at home.

233
00:14:56,292 --> 00:15:00,333
You are very eager to go back to Arnulus.

234
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,625
That was the plan,

235
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:06,125
but when I saw the looks on Hime's face...

236
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:08,833
She has a point.

237
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:11,417
We probably won't make a difference

238
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,167
by collecting all the rings.

239
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:15,125
Don't worry.

240
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:18,708
The rings' power is absolute.

241
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,667
They can certainly
seal the Abyss King away.

242
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:24,542
The dwarves told me so.

243
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,125
Just like the legend?

244
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:30,833
I won't force you.

245
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,458
I was created for the Ring King.

246
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,208
You must witness my existence
until the very end.

247
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,583
Until the very end...

248
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:44,167
I want to know the meaning of my creation.

249
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:47,542
I want to measure the value
of the time I spent waiting for you.

250
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:48,958
That sounds heavy to me.

251
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,000
I am not heavy at all.

252
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,333
I weigh as much as a normal person.

253
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,417
Just kidding.

254
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,333
All the Ring Princesses

255
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,375
live for the Ring King

256
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:05,542
and devote themselves
to saving the world.

257
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,042
Such is the meaning of our births.

258
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,875
Our duty is a difficult one.

259
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,708
The meaning of life...

260
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,375
She's right.

261
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:22,167
Can you hand me the ring?

262
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:25,417
Did you change your mind?

263
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,833
No. I found the answer.

264
00:16:28,667 --> 00:16:30,417
I must do what I'm meant to do.

265
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,167
I see.

266
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,042
I'm so happy to hear that.

267
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't you want to know why?

268
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:44,333
The will of the Ring King is mine as well.

269
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,667
There's no need for a reason.

270
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:47,625
I see.

271
00:17:11,542 --> 00:17:12,750
Hime...

272
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,708
Sorry for startling you.

273
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,292
I thought about Gramps again.

274
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,333
But it's all right now.

275
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,500
I couldn't hold my tears just now.

276
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,333
I'll get used to it very soon.

277
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,333
That ring...

278
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,542
The Ring of Earth.

279
00:17:42,542 --> 00:17:44,208
We have all five rings now.

280
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,042
Did you get that from Amber?

281
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:48,042
Why?

282
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,208
I want to go back to Arnulus.

283
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,833
No! You can't!

284
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,792
We are only here

285
00:17:56,792 --> 00:17:58,667
because we didn't have all the rings.

286
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,542
But we have all of them now.

287
00:18:01,542 --> 00:18:02,750
It's time to go.

288
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,250
Of course I know!

289
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,750
But we are finally together again.

290
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,792
What if you die
in that world full of danger?

291
00:18:12,542 --> 00:18:14,167
Is the duty of a Ring Princess

292
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:16,375
so insignificant to you?

293
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,375
We grew up together
in the past ten years.

294
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,417
That's all I know.

295
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,000
Isn't that duty worth realising

296
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,417
even if you have to give up

297
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:29,042
those ten years?

298
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:33,792
To break free from
the fate of a Ring Princess,

299
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:36,708
you must not run away or forget.

300
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,792
The right way
is to put an end to all of this.

301
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,667
Hime, let's face it together.

302
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,875
I'll be right next to you this time.

303
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,125
You don't have to carry
this duty by yourself any more.

304
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:56,500
As Gramps said,

305
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,167
our bond powers the rings.

306
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:04,167
No one in this world
loves you more than I do.

307
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,958
Don't worry, I can win the fight.

308
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,583
What? You sound so silly.

309
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,792
But I'm relieved.

310
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,583
There's no way
you can lose with that spirit.

311
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,708
Hime...

312
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:29,500
Well then, I should answer your love.

313
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:33,542
Satou.

314
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:37,083
Why don't we fulfil
our promise from that day?

315
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,167
You mean...

316
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,417
Don't make me say it out loud.

317
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,542
This feels like a dream.

318
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:52,542
We're actually doing it in this room.

319
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,333
Hime...

320
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:10,125
I'm getting a head start.

321
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:14,417
I feel sorry for the others.

322
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,375
Didn't I tell you?
My heart belongs to you alone.

323
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,542
The teleportation device is ready.

324
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,917
We can now return to Arnulus...

325
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,750
Is this a bad time?

326
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:44,083
The teleportation device
can only be used once.

327
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:44,958
What's the plan now?

328
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,542
We are going back now! Immediately!

329
00:20:47,653 --> 00:20:49,236
Right, Hime?

330
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,833
Yeah.

331
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,542
Satou, what happened?

332
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,708
No, don't get the wrong idea.

333
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,875
So, the time has come.

334
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,333
You noticed?

335
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:08,542
I'd be disappointed
if you underestimated a catfolk's

336
00:21:08,542 --> 00:21:09,417
perceptiveness.

337
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:13,583
Granart, I want to apologise.

338
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:16,833
No, I understand how you feel.

339
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:21,750
There's no telling
how bad the situation is in Arnulus.

340
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:25,250
I was going to respect Satou's decision,

341
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,083
but I also anticipated this outcome.

342
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,625
Hold on.

343
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,125
I'm completely at a loss here.

344
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,542
There's no time to explain. Anyway...

345
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,125
What?

346
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:40,708
The girl is Amber Idanokan?

347
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,625
The Ring Princess of Earth?

348
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:45,750
Are we going back?

349
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,792
Correct.

350
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:49,042
We can head back to Arnulus now.

351
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:50,589
I see.

352
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,000
I see. We can finally go back.

353
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,625
All right, we are all set.

354
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,958
Let's go.

355
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,917
Huh? Are we going somewhere?

356
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,667
Stay still and hold on tight.
