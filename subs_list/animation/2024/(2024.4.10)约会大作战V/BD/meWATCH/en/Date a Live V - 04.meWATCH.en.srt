1
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:08,258
Well, let's see what should
I cook up for dinner?

2
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,887
Mana said she wanted to eat curry...

3
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,382
What is... happening?

4
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,634
What is...

5
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,691
It can't be... is this spacequake?

6
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:35,470
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

7
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:41,184
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

8
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:46,648
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

9
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:52,154
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

10
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:58,452
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

11
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:06,543
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

12
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:12,633
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

13
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:18,805
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

14
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:24,102
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

15
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:28,106
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

16
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:32,653
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

17
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:39,534
<i>in our hands alight</i>

18
00:02:56,927 --> 00:03:00,972
Brother! Thank God you're all...

19
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:02,182
...right...

20
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:08,187
Brother?

21
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,399
Mana, erm, this is...

22
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,235
It's fine!
Mana's on your side, Brother!

23
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:16,029
Let us atone for our sins
from now on!

24
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,073
There is nothing fine about it!

25
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,284
I understand what happened...

26
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:25,288
Still! You don't have
to bring her to our house!

27
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,749
I didn't have a choice, you know.

28
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,794
The town was in a panic,
she wasn't talking,

29
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,296
and I didn't know what to do.

30
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,552
Anyway, let's give her my clothes!

31
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,762
I'll get it for you right now.

32
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,286
I see.

33
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,539
I have a rough idea
of the linguistic system.

34
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:10,041
Is something wrong?

35
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,753
No, it's just...

36
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:17,716
We were surprised when a child who could
only speak "Ah..." or "Uh..." yesterday

37
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:22,012
suddenly started to speak fluently.

38
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,557
Perhaps your Japanese
is more correct than Mana's...

39
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:32,272
Seems like you want to say nothing but
"Ah," and "Uh" for a while, Brother...

40
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:36,401
Wait, relax,
I like your distinct personality!

41
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,028
As long as you understand.

42
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,822
By the way, I have a question...

43
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,034
Who on earth are you?

44
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,620
You are obviously not normal.

45
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:51,249
Did yesterday's spacequake
have anything to do with you?

46
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,419
Sorry, I don't know...

47
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,216
I don't think she's lying.

48
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,511
Then, can you tell us what you know?

49
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,555
Um... I want to know about you.

50
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,682
What I remember is...

51
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:13,021
It's like yesterday, after something
exploded on the horizon...

52
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,066
There were three people there,

53
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:20,028
two young men and a girl.

54
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,863
Three people?

55
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,241
After an explosion like yesterday...

56
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,202
Are you talking about
the Eurasian Air Disaster?

57
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,374
Are you okay?!

58
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:35,794
I'm fine, I just felt a little pain...

59
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,172
Is that so? Please don't force yourself.

60
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,717
Thank you.

61
00:05:45,204 --> 00:05:49,668
So, what should we do
about her, Brother?

62
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:52,310
Well, what do you mean by that?

63
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,228
Should we call the polic―

64
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:54,354
W-Wait!

65
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,691
It seems like the police and hospitals
have been in chaos since yesterday,

66
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,485
and if you're suddenly thrown her
in a place like that...

67
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,029
Ah... I know.

68
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,032
I guess we'll just have to wait
and watch her at our place.

69
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,119
She doesn't seem to be a bad kid.

70
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,623
You will let me stay here?

71
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,752
Yes. Father and Mother
aren't here now either...

72
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:22,632
Erm, that's right,
we didn't introduce ourselves yet.

73
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,135
We still didn't know
each other name yet.

74
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:26,636
Name?

75
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,180
Yes. My name is Shinji Takamiya.

76
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,682
She's my little sister...

77
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,100
I am Mana Takamiya!

78
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,228
Shinji and Mana Takamiya?

79
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,272
So, what's your name?

80
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,774
Do you have a name?

81
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,279
My... name is...

82
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,451
Ah, um, you don't have to
force yourself to remember it.

83
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:52,621
And who knows, maybe your memory
will come back to you in time.

84
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,790
But it would be a problem
to call her without a name,

85
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,043
so we need to think
of something to call her.

86
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,879
I guess you are right...

87
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,423
(May)

88
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,800
That's right, Mio.

89
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,010
Mio?

90
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,305
Mio, kanji written as "zero" with the
three strokes "water" radical, for now.

91
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,863
Ooh! I think it's good enough!

92
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:14,309
By the way,
where did it come from?

93
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:18,410
You see, yesterday was May 30th, right?

94
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:21,066
It's Mio because
it was "three" strokes and "zero".

95
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,068
Ugh...

96
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:25,820
Mio?

97
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,323
However, since there is
also a public perception,

98
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:31,409
let's say for the time being
that you are our relative.

99
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:35,580
So, your full name
will be Mio Takamiya!

100
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,583
Mio Takamiya?

101
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,801
Huh? It's strange...

102
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,387
I'm so happy... but why?

103
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,597
This is...

104
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,358
So, Ike...

105
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:06,069
Do you really think she's in this city?

106
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,614
Maybe she already
ran away somewhere.

107
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,243
Anyway, I just hope she's okay...

108
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,599
Alright!

109
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,395
Finally got it.

110
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,605
Here you go, Mio.

111
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,609
Are you giving it to me?

112
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:51,031
That's the reason I took it.
Perhaps you didn't want it?

113
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:55,118
You were looking at it the whole time we
were walking, so I assumed you liked it.

114
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,249
Like? The feelings of fondness...

115
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,544
Strong interest in the subject...

116
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:09,257
That's it... yeah,
I'm sure that's "like".

117
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:13,136
I "like" you.

118
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,642
Um... Mio.

119
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,811
If you'd like to...

120
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:24,647
h-have a date with me!

121
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,652
Ugh...
I need to practice some more...

122
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:34,657
M-Morning, Mio! What a beautiful day,
why don't we go out for a bit?

123
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,367
No, it's wrong...

124
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,996
I mean, we go shopping
together all the time...

125
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:43,041
Rather, I want Mio to think...

126
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,294
that it is just a normal date!

127
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,421
Aah... Ahem!

128
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,633
Mio, let's have a date with me.

129
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,801
Okay.

130
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,260
W-Wha... M-Mio?!

131
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,346
Yes? What's wrong, Shin?

132
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,223
H-How long have you been there?

133
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,560
Since you said, "No, it's wrong," Shin.

134
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,522
So, when are we going to do it, Shin?

135
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:07,816
Huh? W-What of?

136
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,318
I mean, the date.

137
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,570
Date?!

138
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,905
Yeah...

139
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,199
Do you want to go on a date?

140
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:20,370
That naive, oblivious, obsequious Brother
of mine has asked you out on a date?!

141
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:23,581
Whoa...

142
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,001
Yeah. But when I think about it,

143
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:30,797
a date is a time when a man and
a woman meet together, right?

144
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,592
Shin and I are spending
every day together,

145
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:40,598
and I wasn't sure what it meant for
the two of us to go out together again.

146
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:46,229
No, in short, my brother wants
to get to know you better, Mio!

147
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,983
I would say that he is showing
his favor to you, Mio...

148
00:10:52,008 --> 00:10:52,986
Mio?

149
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:58,199
Is that so... Shin favors me, huh...

150
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,993
That's great to hear...

151
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,498
Geez!

152
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,378
All right! If that's the case,
let's prepare for it!

153
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,131
I've heard the story!

154
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,134
I'm Haruko Homura!
Mana's dearest friend!

155
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,678
Let me take care of it!

156
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,096
Dearest friend?

157
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:24,392
Oh, it's not a word in the dictionary,
so don't worry about it.

158
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:28,188
Haruko is a fashion expert,
so I asked her to help me out.

159
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:32,400
I have heard about you,
but you are really beautiful.

160
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,238
Who is the lucky boy who gets
to date such a beautiful girl?

161
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,365
Well, it's my Brother.

162
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:42,285
Huh?! Seriously? He did it!

163
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,537
Okay, I've got it figured out!

164
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:48,041
This is challenging in many ways!

165
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,669
The first step is to wear
an item that doubles your focus!

166
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,925
What should I choose?

167
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,177
T-Then...

168
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,554
I will be in your care.

169
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,811
Shin?

170
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,813
Ah. Huh?

171
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:22,575
What's the matter?
You look scared...

172
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,911
H-Huh... S-Sorry.

173
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,829
Am I making that kind of face?

174
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,375
You did.
It's like you're off to a war...

175
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,586
A war, huh?

176
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,756
Sorry, I was kind of spaced out...

177
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,007
Um...

178
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,969
I-It's because you are so cute, Mio!

179
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,560
Then...

180
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,230
Shall we go?

181
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,110
Yes, let's begin...

182
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,028
...our date.

183
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,039
Sea...

184
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,292
You said you wanted
to see it at least once, right?

185
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,878
I'm so happy. Thank you, Shin!

186
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,132
Yeah, I'm glad you enjoyed it.

187
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,637
A-Ah, Mio!

188
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,892
Mio! The hem of your skirt...

189
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:31,644
Shin.

190
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,026
Ah, Mio!

191
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:42,155
H-Hey, Mio...

192
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:57,587
Uh, M-Mio...

193
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,539
What are you going
to make for dinner tonight?

194
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,502
I haven't decided yet. Is there
anything you want to eat, Mio?

195
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,880
I'll eat whatever you cook, Shin...

196
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:45,218
Mio?

197
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,394
This way!

198
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,645
Mio!

199
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,647
What in the world is going on?!

200
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,273
I will explain it later!

201
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,316
Hurry!

202
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,914
Who are you guys?!

203
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:18,292
Shin, hang on to me!

204
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:28,886
Shin!

205
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,639
I'm okay... Anyway, you need to run...

206
00:15:40,349 --> 00:15:41,570
Show me your hand.

207
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,677
Who in the world are those guys...?

208
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,513
Maybe they were after me.

209
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,308
I'm starting to remember...

210
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,562
When I first woke up, the guy
from earlier was in front of me...

211
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,690
Then he tried to capture me...

212
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,613
I'm sorry, it's my fault
for dragging you into this...

213
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,199
Just run. I'll handle the res―

214
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,228
I don't want to!

215
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:38,039
I'm prepared for some trouble
when I protect a child

216
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,791
with a mysterious power.

217
00:16:43,311 --> 00:16:44,369
We are...

218
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:46,289
...family, you know.

219
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,846
Anyway, let's go to a public place.

220
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,932
Then we can go to the police.

221
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,559
Don't underestimate the rule of law!

222
00:17:03,138 --> 00:17:04,440
Stand back!

223
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,650
Mio...

224
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,693
Don't worry, I won't let him kill you!

225
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:10,279
Hey, hey, are you kidding me?

226
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,450
Why are you coming
to me of all people?

227
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,996
Is Mio her name?

228
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,082
Yeah, I'm the one who gave it!

229
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,918
Is that so? It's a good name.

230
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:27,088
Well, are you happy right now?

231
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,925
At least I don't have
a penchant for enjoying

232
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,969
being chased by a hostile person.

233
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:35,888
No, that's not what I mean...

234
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,724
I mean, do you want to be with him?

235
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,683
I see.

236
00:17:47,331 --> 00:17:48,359
Just go.

237
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,861
What does that mean?

238
00:17:51,752 --> 00:17:55,178
It's not a problem.
Just get out of here.

239
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,912
I'm...

240
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,124
entrusting Mio to you, boy.

241
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,720
It's been a while, Spirit...

242
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,722
I've missed you...

243
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,602
And it was a pleasure
to meet you, young man.

244
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,356
Thank you for protecting our Spirit...

245
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,233
I really appreciate it.

246
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,276
Don't mess with me!

247
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,695
You see, your sister's in our custody.

248
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,281
Let's return them

249
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,283
to where they belong.

250
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:41,162
Bastard! Try and do something to Mana!
I'll never let you get away!

251
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:45,166
Oho, she is called Mana, huh?

252
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,209
That is a good pun.

253
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:51,339
It's no wonder the spirit
has drifted into your home.

254
00:18:55,289 --> 00:18:56,550
Promise me...

255
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,722
that if I go with you,
you will return Mana back.

256
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,723
Huh?

257
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,976
Yes, of course.

258
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:05,561
Mio?!

259
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,982
It's okay, I was never supposed
to be here in the first place...

260
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:14,737
I was happy to be with you,
even for a moment.

261
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,334
Screw you...

262
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,461
Goddamn it!

263
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,880
Shin, what are you doing?!

264
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,175
Stupid!
You think he will keep his word?

265
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:40,805
What is the guarantee that they won't kill me
or Mana just because they got you, Mio?

266
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:45,393
As long as I got you, Mio,
those guys can't touch Mana!

267
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,104
Then it's best to take a stand here―

268
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,868
Shin...

269
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,453
Good lord.

270
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,708
I had no intention of lying to you.

271
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,834
Shin!

272
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,338
Mi...

273
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,011
o...

274
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:17,240
I see...

275
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,196
I just need to rebuild it.

276
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,801
I'll never let go of you again.

277
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:45,387
I will never make a mistake again...

278
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:47,723
So...

279
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,728
wait for me,

280
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,687
Shin.
