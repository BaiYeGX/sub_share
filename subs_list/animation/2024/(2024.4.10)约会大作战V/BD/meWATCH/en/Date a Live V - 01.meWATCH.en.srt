1
00:00:05,713 --> 00:00:08,007
I have never dreamed...

2
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,259
...of that scene from that day.

3
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:14,263
Even though a long,
long time has passed,

4
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:17,892
my memories haven't
faded in the slightest.

5
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,979
I've wished to at least...

6
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,440
meet him in a dream...

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,400
...for countless times.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:28,945
I miss you.

9
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,446
I want to meet you.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,323
Once again.

11
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,547
Oh, my dear self.
Are you okay?

12
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:49,549
I am...

13
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,218
Never mind me,
where is Miss Murasame?

14
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:52,927
I mean...

15
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,554
Can you sense the Phantom's presence?

16
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,098
She's nowhere to be found.

17
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,101
It seems she had disappeared.

18
00:01:00,893 --> 00:01:03,104
How disappointing, isn't it?

19
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,816
A spirit dispersing her power
too much ends up like this.

20
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:09,068
However...

21
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,071
Defeating the phantom
doesn't necessarily mean

22
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:15,575
our objective has been fulfilled.

23
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,995
Yes, of course.

24
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:24,000
What we're after isn't some
half-hearted figure like now,

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,126
but rather

26
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,587
the monster at its peak from the past.

27
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,921
But...

28
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,464
Why did the phantom

29
00:01:30,464 --> 00:01:34,468
divide her own power to increase
the number of spirits?

30
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:38,472
Even though it's inevitable that
she would weaken herself by doing so.

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,396
Does that mean Kurumi
saved you 204 times, Shido?

32
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,230
Yeah, she did.

33
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,692
Every time I was killed,
she would rewind time

34
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,111
and prevent the DEM's attack.

35
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,779
Kurumi's objective is

36
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:58,826
to save her friend by defeating
the Spirit of Origin in the past.

37
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,413
And to prevent all tragedies

38
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,749
caused by the birth of
Spirits from ever occurring.

39
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,377
That's why she needs
my spiritual power.

40
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:14,425
I never would have thought
Kurumi had such circumstances.

41
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,011
That surprised me.

42
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,847
Talk about our Sephira within us

43
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:25,478
are refined through the sacrifice
of many lives, aren't they?

44
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:28,356
It makes me feel conflicted.

45
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,360
No matter what circumstances
Kurumi may have,

46
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,321
we can't just hand over
Shido's spiritual power.

47
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,989
That's our fundamental
premise, after all.

48
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,115
Moreover,

49
00:02:38,115 --> 00:02:42,244
there's no guarantee that Kurumi can
defeat this so-called Spirit of Origin either.

50
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:45,873
Besides, it's hard to believe
all of this suddenly.

51
00:02:45,873 --> 00:02:47,249
Yeah.

52
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:50,961
You've fought Kurumi
many times before, after all.

53
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:52,380
- But still...
- However!

54
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,635
Well, if I were asked which is more
likely, my brother lying to me or not,

55
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,513
it's a close call, but I'd have
to reluctantly believe it.

56
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,848
It's kind of complicated, isn't it?

57
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:06,018
Well, I get what you're
trying to say, though.

58
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:08,145
Anyway, Brother.

59
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:10,815
There's one more thing
I'm curious about.

60
00:03:12,024 --> 00:03:14,193
It's about the woman

61
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:16,529
named "Mio Takamiya"
mentioned in your story.

62
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,157
I don't think she's
unrelated to us, brother.

63
00:03:20,157 --> 00:03:22,368
If "Takamiya" is her real surname,

64
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:26,539
there's a possibility that
she's a relative of ours, blood-related.

65
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,916
To be honest,
I'm curious about that, too.

66
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:32,420
Who is this Mio Takamiya, actually?

67
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,172
What is her purpose
behind creating spirits?

68
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:38,426
Kurumi was given Sephira
to turn her into a Spirit.

69
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,930
It's as if the "Phantom"
appeared before us.

70
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,932
Mio Takamiya.

71
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:45,850
Phantom.

72
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,061
And also the Spirit of Origin
that Kurumi mentioned...

73
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,690
Question.
What is the relationship

74
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,025
between these three entities?

75
00:03:55,025 --> 00:03:59,363
Geez... I wish I could
use Rasiel right now...

76
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:01,991
The answer to all of this should've
come out immediately.

77
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,327
I see.
Quite a peculiar story, isn't it?

78
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:08,706
If you're so curious, Mister,

79
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,959
perhaps you should try to remember
what happened in the past.

80
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:14,587
If only it were that easy,
there would be no trouble.

81
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,839
But both I and Mana

82
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,716
have lost our memories from the past.

83
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:21,051
We don't even know
why that happened,

84
00:04:21,051 --> 00:04:23,846
another thing we're clueless about.

85
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,724
You had told me about that before.

86
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:30,352
That's why, I'm suggesting that
you should try to remember.

87
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,731
Can we actually <i>do</i> that?

88
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,609
Muku's "Michael" is the absolute key.

89
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,736
There is nothing
that cannot be unlocked.

90
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:43,407
Even if it's the door
to closed memories.

91
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,746
Wait a minute!
Will it be okay if you do that?

92
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,749
I don't know what happened in the past.

93
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,918
It wouldn't be good
if something bad happened

94
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,629
to Darling as soon as
he regained his memories.

95
00:04:57,254 --> 00:04:58,088
Brother?

96
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,133
It's okay.
Don't worry about me.

97
00:05:01,842 --> 00:05:04,136
It's not just my relationship
with Mio Takamiya,

98
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:07,139
but also what happened
in the past between me and Mana,

99
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,849
and the person who wants to know

100
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,267
more than anyone else is me.

101
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:13,270
Shido...

102
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:15,177
Michael!

103
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:22,071
All right. Let's go.

104
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:22,835
Yeah!

105
00:05:23,537 --> 00:05:27,076
Don't worry.
You can trust Michael.

106
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:31,664
Oh no! I can't believe there's something
that thorny in my darling's mind.

107
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,667
- No! You can't do that!
- Miku! Can you shut your mouth?!

108
00:06:04,154 --> 00:06:07,408
Oh. Are you awake, Shin?

109
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,243
Hmm?

110
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,203
Is anything wrong?

111
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:14,957
Uhm, no.
Nothing.

112
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:16,375
Shido!

113
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:18,377
Are you okay?

114
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:19,545
Shido!

115
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,131
Don't push yourself too hard.

116
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,799
Well, well.

117
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,384
What's going on here?

118
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,553
"What's going on," my arse!

119
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,306
I was shocked when you
suddenly collapsed!

120
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,934
Affirmative.
After inserting Michael into your head,

121
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:35,978
you lost consciousness.

122
00:06:38,188 --> 00:06:39,356
I see...

123
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:42,109
I'm sorry for causing you worry.

124
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:44,570
Not at all.
I'm just glad you're awake.

125
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:46,280
It all thanks to my kiss.

126
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,282
I've woken up
the sleeping beauty.

127
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:48,866
What?

128
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,911
What are you yapping about?

129
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,787
You better don't buy it, Shido.

130
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:55,581
But hold on a second.

131
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,834
There are a lot of molecules
floating around in this room,

132
00:06:58,834 --> 00:07:01,211
and I can't be sure that
the molecules in my breath

133
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:04,465
haven't touched Shido's mouth.

134
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,802
This means we could assume that
we were kissing indirectly.

135
00:07:08,802 --> 00:07:10,930
Wait a second, Professor!

136
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,726
So that means that all of us who have been
in the same room since a moment ago are...

137
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:19,063
Deep kissing in a frenzy.

138
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:21,649
Such a genius in the field!

139
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,693
Why hasn't the academia
discovered this theory yet?!

140
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:28,197
Hold on a second.
I'm completely lost here.

141
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,324
Why and how could we
end up in such a frenzy?

142
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:35,329
I'll explain it to you practically later.
The three of us, including Natsumi!

143
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,374
My apology, Mister.

144
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,961
Muku was confident about "using Michael,"
yet things went completely south.

145
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,130
Nah, nah. It's all good.

146
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:47,216
See? I'm fine.

147
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:49,718
Mister...

148
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:53,097
So, how was it, Brother?

149
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,140
Did you recall something?

150
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,517
Yeah. It was...

151
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,479
What? This feels off.

152
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,482
I'm pretty sure
I saw something earlier.

153
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:04,984
But I...

154
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,652
I can't remember it.

155
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,658
No need to rush, Shin.

156
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,161
We'll find another way.

157
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:17,496
Reine...

158
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,415
If that's the case,

159
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,792
would you try it on me, too?

160
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:22,543
Huh?

161
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:27,297
Although you can't, I might
be able to remember something.

162
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:29,133
We'll find out about Mio Takamiya

163
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,845
and what happened to us in the past.

164
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,723
Yeah, yeah.
We can do that someday.

165
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,809
For now, let's wait for Shido's recovery.

166
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,852
Huh?

167
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,437
Why wouldn't you let me?

168
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:44,857
Yeah, she's right.

169
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,943
I'm sorry, Mana.
Let's do it someday, okay?

170
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:49,278
Hmm?

171
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:54,906
Ike, you said you've
done your research?

172
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,120
I've found out how
Nightmare, Kurumi Tokisaki,

173
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,374
was able to thwart
our attacks at every turn.

174
00:09:03,288 --> 00:09:07,584
You see, she knew
our plans before we did.

175
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:09,798
To put things correctly,

176
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:14,636
she actually experienced
and avoided the fate of death

177
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:18,390
that was coming to
Shido Itsuka, altering it each time.

178
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:22,227
But it would be troublesome
if she really did that.

179
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,355
We're always behind her.

180
00:09:25,355 --> 00:09:27,024
I know.

181
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,276
But that doesn't mean
it's a disadvantage.

182
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,405
What may be a few operations for us,

183
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:36,533
is hundreds for Nightmare.

184
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:40,829
After all, repeating the same thing over
and over again is mentally exhausting.

185
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:42,873
Even for Nightmare,

186
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,668
there is no way her strength
and energy will last forever.

187
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,421
We just have to wait
until Nightmare gives up.

188
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:51,173
Am I right?

189
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,426
Well, yes, indeed.

190
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,302
But...

191
00:09:55,844 --> 00:09:57,471
We can't be sure that the Nightmare

192
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:02,017
wouldn't eventually lead us
to a solution we didn't think of.

193
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,187
We will have to do everything we can

194
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,482
to get her to give up
as soon as possible.

195
00:10:11,151 --> 00:10:13,112
Father, Father!

196
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,321
Take a look at this!

197
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:15,948
I caught this thing.

198
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,533
Nightmare?!

199
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:21,328
She's been eavesdropping, huh?
Nice work, Nibelcole.

200
00:10:22,094 --> 00:10:25,457
But I lost some of them I was with.

201
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:29,336
Maybe they have heard some
of your conversations, Father.

202
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:31,380
That sounds good, actually.

203
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,631
It will be a fierce battle,

204
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:35,384
with both sides aware of
each other's strengths and weaknesses.

205
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,887
There would still be at least one left.

206
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,849
Tell it to your master.

207
00:10:42,349 --> 00:10:44,059
That Shido Itsuka...

208
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,562
...will die by my hand.

209
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,440
No matter how many
times you rewind the time,

210
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,068
no matter how many
times you repeat the world,

211
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,745
no matter how many times
you rewrite history...

212
00:10:57,215 --> 00:11:01,010
I'll be so thorough that
it can't be overturned.

213
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,746
Now, let's see what you've got...

214
00:11:05,914 --> 00:11:08,167
...the Worst Spirit.

215
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,716
I was relieved yesterday.

216
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,634
Mana could listen
and agree with me, somehow.

217
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:21,388
After all, Mana is
being enchanted by DEM, right?

218
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:23,891
If she could recall that time,

219
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,268
it would be pretty damaging.

220
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,396
Even though, I'd certainly like to get
more information on Mio Takamiya.

221
00:11:29,396 --> 00:11:31,854
Mio Takamiya, huh?

222
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:34,610
I don't know why,

223
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:35,402
but surely,

224
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:38,197
it sounds like a name
I've known for a long time.

225
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:44,870
Kurumi!

226
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,041
Greetings, Shido and Kotori.

227
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,876
Morning, Kurumi.

228
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,004
What a pretty outfit
you're wearing today.

229
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,297
She's an alter ego.

230
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,966
Thanks for helping me last night.

231
00:11:57,966 --> 00:11:59,343
Don't mention it.

232
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:03,472
But it's too early for you
to thank me yet.

233
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:10,437
On February 20th, DEM Industries
will come to kill you...

234
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:13,440
...with all its might, Shido.

235
00:12:14,441 --> 00:12:18,195
I came here today to inform you that.

236
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,824
And what's your goal?

237
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,705
As a matter of fact, the real
Kurumi Tokisaki does not know

238
00:12:28,705 --> 00:12:31,959
that I, her alter ego, am here.

239
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:38,131
The real me is going to take care
of this one on her own.

240
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:41,843
No matter how many times
she has to rewind the time...

241
00:12:41,843 --> 00:12:45,389
...until you grasp
the future to survive, Shido.

242
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:50,185
Yet even that determination
will be known to the enemy.

243
00:12:50,727 --> 00:12:53,021
That's why the all-out attack

244
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,107
of the DEM is also

245
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:57,943
a scheme to discourage
the hearts and minds

246
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,654
of the time-traveling "me."

247
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:04,533
So the reason you are here is

248
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,494
to urge Shido to evacuate?

249
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:10,998
Well, that's not entirely true.

250
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,627
If the fact that
"I" am fighting so hard

251
00:13:15,627 --> 00:13:19,131
for you, Shido, to protect you,
yet you don't know about it...

252
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,758
...that would be such a waste, no?

253
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,636
Ah. I see.

254
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:32,060
Well then, farewell.
Please survive.

255
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,103
Shido.

256
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,021
Kurumi.

257
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:37,107
Yes? What is it?

258
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,442
If it is possible,

259
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,610
would you tell Kurumi this?

260
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,837
"Thank you."

261
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:44,823
"I'm alive now because of you."

262
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,493
"But I can't keep being saved forever."

263
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:50,704
"When I'm done with the DEMs,

264
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,789
this time I'll seal your spirit power."

265
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,125
No, that's not it.

266
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,544
"This time...

267
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,130
I'm going to snatch your lips!"

268
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:03,884
"You better be prepared for that,
My Honey."

269
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,768
That's a wonderful poem.

270
00:14:13,268 --> 00:14:16,021
"I" am a very lucky girl.

271
00:14:31,536 --> 00:14:34,039
(1 Unread Message: Reine, come to the
conference room. We have an emergency.)

272
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:37,167
Here he comes, the Wizard.

273
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:39,920
We've got a serious situation here.

274
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,764
Given the circumstances,

275
00:14:41,765 --> 00:14:45,550
the information from
Kurumi's alter ego is not less credible.

276
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,094
But that doesn't mean

277
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,930
we can run and hide forever.

278
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,891
However, there's simply
no way to negotiate.

279
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:53,683
Confirmation.

280
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:56,186
There is no way to discuss this
with them at all.

281
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,562
So that means...

282
00:14:57,562 --> 00:14:59,314
Only one option remains.

283
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,566
It's about taking down the DEM.

284
00:15:02,859 --> 00:15:04,820
And of course, it's not easy.

285
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,073
But we have no choice
but to go aggressive.

286
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:11,284
In order to seize the future
with our own hands.

287
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:14,329
<i>That's right, Commander Itsuka.</i>

288
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:15,497
Mr. Woodman!

289
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,581
Oh!

290
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:19,251
Are you feeling better already?

291
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,544
<i>Yeah.</i>

292
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,838
<i>I'm sorry I've caused
you so much worry.</i>

293
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,383
<i>I'm sorry I haven't been
in touch before.</i>

294
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:30,637
<i>Our enemies are indeed powerful.</i>

295
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,347
<i>But DEM is an organization dominated</i>

296
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:35,600
<i>by the charisma of Isaac Westcott</i>

297
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,730
<i>and the viability of Ellen Mathers.</i>

298
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,691
<i>On the flip side,</i>

299
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,862
<i>once those two things are
eliminated, it's not much of a threat.</i>

300
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,946
So that means

301
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:51,324
defeating Westcott and Ellen
is the only way to win.

302
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:56,997
<i>I see. Then it might be
worth trying "that."</i>

303
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,125
MARIA, what do you mean by "that?"

304
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,879
<i>Perhaps we can immobilize Nibelcole.</i>

305
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,380
<i>That's what I mean.</i>

306
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,548
What?!

307
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:10,385
Actually, I have an idea of
how to deal with the Bandersnatch.

308
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:11,636
Hey, wait a second!

309
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:13,096
By attacking the enemy's New Realizers―

310
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:16,141
Hey, stop it!
Enough talking.

311
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,310
<i>What's wrong, Nia?</i>

312
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,645
<i>We're just getting started.</i>

313
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:24,858
Geez. You don't get it,
do you, Robot Girl?

314
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:28,236
<i>First, I'd like to ask for
an explanation for that name.</i>

315
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:30,780
<i>Depending on the answer,
I might throw you outside.</i>

316
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,115
Have you forgotten?

317
00:16:32,115 --> 00:16:35,410
You see, Westcott can use the
omniscient Demon Lord, Beelzebub.

318
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:37,621
I see.

319
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:41,333
He can find out everything and anything
about all the events in the entire universe.

320
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,834
So that means...

321
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:47,047
They might even know all
about what we're discussing now.

322
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,715
Exactly.

323
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:52,511
However, he could never tell
what people were thinking in their heads

324
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,429
and what the future holds.

325
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:58,934
So even if you come up with a plan,
don't say it out loud.

326
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:01,686
<i>It's frustrating, but you're right.</i>

327
00:17:02,285 --> 00:17:03,980
<i>Thank you for your advice, Nia.</i>

328
00:17:06,274 --> 00:17:07,943
I'm glad that you understood me.

329
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,694
Honesty is a virtue, you know...

330
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,405
...my dear little faceless Robot Girl.

331
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:14,241
<i>Anyway, Nia,</i>

332
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,993
<i>could you please touch
the console sometimes?</i>

333
00:17:16,993 --> 00:17:18,328
Huh? Like this?

334
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,794
What the hell are you doing?!

335
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,255
<i>I appreciate the point you just made.</i>

336
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:32,050
<i>However, you need to
pay for what could be taken</i>

337
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,552
<i>as abusive language towards me.</i>

338
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,304
Oh gosh!
That's a crappy argument!

339
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:39,266
Still, it's inexcusable that

340
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,061
we can't voice our opinions or ideas
when we're at a strategy meeting.

341
00:17:43,061 --> 00:17:46,189
Nevertheless, I think there's something
we can do individually.

342
00:17:46,189 --> 00:17:48,191
I have some things
I need to get done, too.

343
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:52,696
<i>I agree. I'll do what I can to help.</i>

344
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:59,578
Do you have something to say?

345
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,870
Oh my...

346
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:04,624
I have received a report
from another "me".

347
00:18:04,624 --> 00:18:07,085
I heard that you
informed Shido and Kotori

348
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:10,380
of the DEM raid, didn't you?

349
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,593
You can't just do whatever you want
without my permission.

350
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,220
The punishment for disrupting the order

351
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,889
will be a death sentence.

352
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,309
Well...

353
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,519
It can't be helped, then.

354
00:18:25,895 --> 00:18:27,314
There's one last thing.

355
00:18:28,228 --> 00:18:30,650
I have a message for you from Shido.

356
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:36,114
I love love <i>love</i> you.
Let's get married, My Honey.

357
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,284
You're correct on nothing
but the "My Honey" part!

358
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,789
I knew you had heard his message
from the other alter ego.

359
00:18:52,922 --> 00:18:54,507
Oh my...

360
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:00,305
No one would be foolish enough to purposely
reduce the force before a crucial battle.

361
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,141
If you are one of "my" self,

362
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:05,060
do at least one useful thing

363
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,812
before you die on the battlefield.

364
00:19:10,815 --> 00:19:14,152
Yeah, I know that...

365
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:15,695
My dear self.

366
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,325
A secret organization
that protects the spirits, huh?

367
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:24,454
You expect me to believe that crap
that just came out of the blue?

368
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,289
B-But, Captain...

369
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:30,001
The fact that the two of them put
their lives on the line like this...

370
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:33,463
...is not something that can
be easily dismissed as a lie, is it?

371
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,174
I think it's fair to say
that you don't believe us.

372
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:39,552
But they will refuse it all
because it's true.

373
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:42,430
On February 20, in Tengu City,

374
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,349
a major battle will possibly take place.

375
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:49,521
At that time, you may also be requested
by the DEM to mobilize, Captain.

376
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:52,732
But please ignore that.

377
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:58,279
And you say this information was obtained
by a secret organization called Ratatoskr?

378
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:01,366
But even if that were true...

379
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:02,242
That's right.

380
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,953
Rejecting a DEM request

381
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:07,622
means ignoring orders
from high command.

382
00:20:07,622 --> 00:20:12,669
Are you asking us to give up
our jobs and go to jail?

383
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,962
And also...

384
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,632
What do you mean
we shouldn't attack the spirits?

385
00:20:17,632 --> 00:20:19,509
They are the natural enemy
of mankind, aren't they?

386
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,763
That should be considered malicious
manipulation of information by the DEM.

387
00:20:23,763 --> 00:20:27,183
After all, the spirits have
no intention of attacking humans.

388
00:20:28,768 --> 00:20:31,563
I mean, even if you say so...

389
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:35,900
If what you just said is true,

390
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,530
I'd love to tinker with that secret
organization's new weapon.

391
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,782
My mechanic instincts are kicking in!

392
00:20:42,782 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm sorry, but could you
be quiet for a second?

393
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:51,916
We can't do that, no way!

394
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,793
Captain...

395
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:54,794
How unfortunate.

396
00:20:54,794 --> 00:20:57,172
But I can't blame Captain
for her choice.

397
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,216
But if it turns out to be a battlefield,

398
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:02,552
I'd want you to at least stay back.

399
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,054
I don't want to kill you all.

400
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,266
It is bold of you to underestimate us.

401
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:09,642
Sure, you were
a skilled fighter, but...

402
00:21:13,104 --> 00:21:13,912
Please.

403
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,247
Zaphkiel.

404
00:21:31,247 --> 00:21:32,373
Het.

405
00:21:32,373 --> 00:21:33,458
Het.

406
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,459
Het.

407
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,460
Het.

408
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:42,967
Het. Het. Het.
Het. Het. Het. Het.

409
00:21:48,097 --> 00:21:49,766
All right...

410
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:53,978
Let's begin our date!

412
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:13,915

413
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:20,255

<i>A flower fluttering in the air</i>

<i>One day, I'll keep it a secret</i>

417
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:43,987
<i>Those faint and vivid shadows</i>

418
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,865
<i>I'm still here and breathing</i>

419
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:50,451
<i>With the pain that never ceases</i>

420
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:53,496

<i>The battle against DEM is approaching,</i>
(Episode 2: "The Final Rest")
