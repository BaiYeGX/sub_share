1
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,323
Reine...

2
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:54,513
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

3
00:00:54,513 --> 00:01:00,227
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

4
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:05,691
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

5
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

6
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:17,494
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

7
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:25,586
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

8
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:31,758
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

9
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:37,931
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

10
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:43,145
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

11
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,149
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

12
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:52,029
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

13
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:58,577
<i>in our hands alight</i>

14
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,932
Good morning, Reine.

15
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:28,774
Was I actually...

16
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,401
Yes, you were asleep.

17
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,029
You only slept for
about five minutes, though.

18
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,783
Reine?

19
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,542
Reine is laughing?

20
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:52,798
This is my first time hearing
laughter from Analyst Murasame.

21
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,009
Really? So I was asleep, huh?

22
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,138
I see. My bad.

23
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,436
Uhm, is there anything wrong?

24
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,397
I'd like to thank you.

25
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,067
For the first time in a while,
I was able to fall into a peaceful sleep.

26
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,446
Your shoulder must have been
incredibly comfortable to sleep on.

27
00:03:18,153 --> 00:03:18,949
Shido!

28
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:22,577
Reine's affection level
and mental state are fluctuating!

29
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:23,704
This is your chance!

30
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,456
Reine.

31
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,710
Hmm? What's the matter?

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,128
Previously...

33
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,423
Talk about the person you love, Reine.

34
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,094
Am I not good enough for being one?

35
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,974
I never thought
I could replace that person.

36
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:46,643
But, is it wrong for me

37
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:51,356
to care about you in my own way,
different from that person?

38
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,444
Reine...

39
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,327
Shin.

40
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,954
I...

41
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,881
We did it!

42
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:23,889
Commander!

43
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,140
The numbers are fluctuating!

44
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,141
What?!

45
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:38,403
Her spirit power isn't flowing in!

46
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,411
I get it now.

47
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,371
So you'd seen the future, huh?

48
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,083
Why are you shocked like that?

49
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,921
You see, if the path is clear,
memory sharing is also possible.

50
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,882
I mean, this is not
your first time, right?

51
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,219
With this, the mystery
of the day has been solved.

52
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,807
Well, I may have had a hunch,

53
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,184
but I probably just
didn't want to understand it.

54
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,689
Since I was so happy
when you asked me out on a date.

55
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,734
I truly had a wonderful time.

56
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,073
You even made me forgot
about my painful past for just a moment.

57
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:27,494
But dreams always come to an end.

58
00:05:28,196 --> 00:05:29,189
Am I right?

59
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:31,849
Shido?

60
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,920
<i>Shido, DEM is approaching!</i>

61
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,432
It seems like history
has been rewritten.

62
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,981
Would you like to return
to Fraxinus together, Reine?

63
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,609
After defeating DEM,
it'll just be you, me,

64
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,695
and the spirits, living together!

65
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,780
Surely, our day will be fun.

66
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:07,701
Ah... that sounds very appealing.

67
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,832
If I hadn't met Shin, I would've definitely
joined you without a second thought.

68
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,375
Then, please!

69
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,543
But I can't.

70
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,713
I've already met Shin.

71
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:24,843
Although it's true
that I love the spirits,

72
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:27,137
when it comes to meeting Shin again,

73
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:30,338
I can give it all up.

74
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,905
Kurumi?!

75
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,156
Why are you here?!

76
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,911
What do you mean "why"?

77
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:54,915
I rushed to your aid
in your time of need, Shido.

78
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,376
Kurumi.
I'm glad you're finally here.

79
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,670
Now that you're here,
we can get straight to the point.

80
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:06,676
My, my. You're just
as arrogant as ever,

81
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,678
Miss Spirit of Origin?

82
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:13,141
I can't believe I was
so thoroughly deceived.

83
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:18,188
Who would have thought that my
archenemy was so close by all this time?

84
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,691
Regardless, with this,

85
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:24,611
I now have what Westcott possesses
and what you possess,

86
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,113
leaving only two remaining Sephiras.

87
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,951
It's enough to awaken Shin.

88
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,452
All right, then.

89
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,829
Let's see how you're doing it!

90
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:55,141
I'll get them back, Kurumi.

91
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,562
The Sephira within you and half of me.

92
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,940
Huh! I refuse!

93
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:10,281
Come to me, Kurumi.

94
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,665
Kurumi?!

95
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,297
I've been waiting for this moment!

96
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:30,719
Zafkiel!

97
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,309
Kurumi...

98
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:14,888
Mio...

99
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,724
It's been a while since
you've seen me in this form.

100
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:23,188
Well, you have already
met me in this form

101
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,648
in a future I don't know
about, haven't you?

102
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,151
It's a bit complicated, isn't it?

103
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,745
Kurumi's Sephira is missing?

104
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,662
Did she tamper with something?

105
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,666
As expected of my dear friend.

106
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,301
Shin!

107
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,975
This is...

108
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:02,977
DEM's fleets are approaching!

109
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,480
We'll be in their range soon!

110
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,609
Shido, we'll retrieve you.
Let's regroup for now.

111
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,613
Shin, what's wrong with you?
Shin!

112
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:20,745
He was retrieved by Fraxinus, huh?

113
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,999
Right now, that might be
the safest option.

114
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:30,463
It wouldn't be fun to have
this scenery ruined

115
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:34,425
by boorish wizards or
mechanical dolls.

116
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,761
Ain Soph Aur!

117
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,518
- Shido!
- Boy!

118
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,021
Tohka... Everyone...

119
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,731
Are you okay?

120
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,775
Did Mio hurt you?

121
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:54,404
No, but I got a rush
of Mio's memories all at once,

122
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,156
and I got a little confused.

123
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,740
But I'm okay now.

124
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,367
Commander, look at that!

125
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,042
That's Ain Soph Aur!

126
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,545
The Angel of the Spirit of Origin...

127
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:14,549
I had heard about it, but I didn't
expect it to be to this extent.

128
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,678
While DEM is occupied with Mio,
let's retreat.

129
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,637
No!

130
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:23,391
No, I can't.
I still can't escape!

131
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,769
What are you talking about?
Our mission has failed.

132
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,898
We need to retreat for now
and come up with a new plan.

133
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,652
<i>Someone is requesting
communication with us.</i>

134
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,905
<i>What should I do, Kotori?</i>

135
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,533
Alright, connect them.

136
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,495
Shido, look!

137
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:47,874
What? School?!

138
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:49,751
What is going on?!

139
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:54,505
Captain, Mike, and also Mily.

140
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,967
Yuzuru, isn't that...

141
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,137
Shock. That's our classroom!

142
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,640
What the hell is this?!

143
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,777
Are the terrorists attacking us?!

144
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,403
What is going on here?!

145
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,787
<i>As you can see,
my dear Ratatoskr friend.</i>

146
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,789
Westcott!

147
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,042
Isn't this a nice change
of pace once in a while?

148
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:37,548
Now that Deus has appeared, we want
to expedite things on our end as well.

149
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,634
Are you trying to threaten us?!

150
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,303
But that deal won't go through.

151
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:47,850
If we hand over the Sephiras to you,
this entire world would be overwritten

152
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,811
Then it would be pointless, wouldn't it?

153
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,398
Then I'll just kill those spirits

154
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,150
as brutally as possible.

155
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:03,324
If even one spirit join our side,
that would be enough for us.

156
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,132
What is this?!

157
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,051
Design-wise, it's not a hero, isn't it?

158
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,911
It looks like an
evil robotic soldier!

159
00:13:24,912 --> 00:13:26,347
That's so lame!

160
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,017
Oh my God!
Someone, help!

161
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:35,315
Before I die I wanted to bury my face
between a girl's thighs just for once!

162
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:38,401
E-Everyone, please run away!

163
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,903
Even if you say that,
we're already surrounded.

164
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,046
Are you okay?
Ai, Mai, Mii?

165
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,173
What about you,
Tonomachi and Tama?

166
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,759
- Tohka?!
- Tohka?!

167
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,885
Yatogami?!

168
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:05,053
That's so lame?!

169
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:08,056
Everyone, stick together in one place!

170
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,246
O-Origami?!

171
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,134
Nice!

172
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,888
Good. Looks like everyone
got there in time.

173
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,641
I was worried about
doing long-distance teleportation.

174
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:53,661
Ah, geez.

175
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:57,188
Even with Ratatoskr, can we really
cover something like this up?

176
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,148
My stomach already hurts.

177
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:04,404
But I survived, Isaac Westcott!

178
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,365
<i>What a truly skillful display.</i>

179
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:11,285
<i>But it's always wise to keep
a trump card hidden.</i>

180
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,870
Excuse me?!

181
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:19,252
<i>The DEM fleet is attacking the Fraxinus!</i>

182
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:23,214
<i>It's like they're assimilating
and docking with our territory.</i>

183
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,927
Goetia?!
It's Ellen Mathers!

184
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,018
The idea that the ship's interior
is safe is an illusion.

185
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,896
At least, not in front of me!

186
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,285
We always keep a trump card hidden.

187
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:55,955
For a heartless president like you,
you seem to enjoy using nice words.

188
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,457
Mana!

189
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,298
Shido, stop!

190
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,427
Mana!

191
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:19,103
Oh my, it seems like
the siblings are together today.

192
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,063
Can I join in too?

193
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:24,942
Nibelcole!

194
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,700
Westcott!

195
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,954
How's DEM fleet's situation?

196
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,332
They are being attacked by Ain Soph Aur!

197
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,084
Several ships are heavily damaged,
and their formation is in chaos!

198
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,046
They're drawing Mio Takamiya's
attention to the fleet,

199
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,049
while they target Shido.

200
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,427
I can't believe they would use
the entire fleet as a decoy.

201
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,304
That's quite a bold move.

202
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,723
This isn't the time to be impressed.

203
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,476
I'll leave this to you, Kannazuki.

204
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,727
Roger that.

205
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,340
Brother?!

206
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,447
Who would have thought
it'd be a gathering of familiar faces?

207
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:14,617
It's as if we've returned
to the past, isn't it?

208
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,827
Yeah, indeed.

209
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,289
Neither you nor Ellen
have made any progress.

210
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,041
With this much time passed,

211
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,127
one would normally expect
some kind of growth, you know?!

212
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,715
I'd love to reminisce about old times,
but unfortunately,

213
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,385
we're short on time here too.

214
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,306
Before the spirits return,
let me settle this matter.

215
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:45,189
<i>Oh, if you're going for
"matching siblings,"</i>

216
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,441
<i>didn't you miss one of the siblings?</i>

217
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,945
- Kotori?!
- Kotori?!

218
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,238
It can't be helped, right?

219
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:56,617
Mukuro must maintain
the hole for everyone to return.

220
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,620
And Nia doesn't have
the power to fight anymore.

221
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,665
Then it's just me left, isn't it?

222
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:04,250
But still...

223
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,044
Don't worry. I can wield
my power for a little while

224
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,214
without being consumed
by destructive impulses.

225
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,801
It's not a funny joke that I can't
do anything in such a crisis!

226
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,219
Kotori...

227
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,554
Kotori.

228
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,183
Sandalphon!

229
00:18:22,892 --> 00:18:24,186
Wolftail!

230
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:26,939
Camael!

231
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,198
Bring it on,
Isaac Westcott!

232
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,161
We'll show you the power
of us three siblings.

233
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,579
Right, Kotori?

234
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,707
Are we really three siblings?

235
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,376
Quit sweating the small stuff!

236
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:56,469
Interesting. Bring it on then.

237
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,471
Filthy humans!

238
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:13,694
We'll be arriving at
the battlefield shortly, Elliot.

239
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,099
Deus...
Mio, huh?

240
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:24,029
She's the spirit we called
forth thirty years ago, right?

241
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,291
For the sake of revenge
against humanity.

242
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:33,005
Look how it turned out, I've gone and
fallen for quite the wicked woman.

243
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:41,639
But if Deus and the other
spirits are going to fight...

244
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,349
we can't just leave them alone.

245
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,685
What should we protect?

246
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,354
Obviously, both sides.

247
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,022
Both sides...

248
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,983
Is such a thing even possible?

249
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:57,071
It might be impossible for just me.

250
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,864
But if it's that boy,

251
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,159
Shido Itsuka,

252
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:05,503
he must be thinking
the same thing as me.

253
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,667
So you're also going there, Elliot?

254
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,377
Yeah.

255
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:14,505
Karen, could you
handle Wodan's preparations?

256
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:22,138
Don't you think it's a lie that a man
who turned his back on his comrades

257
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:25,850
to protect the spirits

258
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,102
wouldn't risk his life for that mission?

259
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:33,566
It's because of you, with that kind
of mindset, that I've come this far.

260
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,199
I'm counting on you, Karen.

261
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,953
<i>Lord Woodman,
we are awaiting instructions.</i>

262
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,539
<i>This is...</i>

263
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,374
<i>What is this reaction?!</i>

264
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,924
- Shido!
- Brother!

265
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,343
Shido!

266
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,178
Brother!

267
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,565
It's over now.

268
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,192
Damn it!

269
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,319
I can't die here!

270
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,681
And now,

271
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,434
I'm going to return the favor.

272
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:52,311
("The Battlefield That Shouldn't Exist")

273
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,479
Shido.

00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,980
("The Battlefield That Shouldn't Exist")

275
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:12,915
<i>It's all gone by so naturally</i>

276
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:19,255
<i>Seeking out the simple happiness</i>

277
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:24,885
<i>The dry wind that asks</i>

278
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:30,099
<i>A flower fluttering in the air</i>

279
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:37,273
<i>One day, I'll keep it a secret</i>

280
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:42,987
<i>Those faint and vivid shadows</i>

281
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,865
<i>I'm still here and breathing</i>

282
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:49,451
<i>With the pain that never ceases</i>

283
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,496
<i>I'm still here</i>

284
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:58,377
<i>Waiting for you</i>

285
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:10,472
<i>We shall live in this world</i>

286
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:17,021
<i>With those simple happiness</i>

(Episode 11: "Temporary Paradise")

288
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,741
Everyone has a summer
they will never forget.

289
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,493
Next, Episode 11,

290
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,078
"Temporary Paradise."

291
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,623
Would it be a sin

292
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:39,501
to wish for that happiness back?
