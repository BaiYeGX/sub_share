1
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,129
A date...

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:05,135
with me?

3
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:10,385
I'm kind of shocked.
What are you talking about, Shin?

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,054
Can't we?

5
00:00:12,054 --> 00:00:15,599
There should still be
a full day for the DEM raid.

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,262
That's true, but you wouldn't need to
conduct training right away, would you?

7
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:21,939
It's not about training!

8
00:00:22,976 --> 00:00:26,568
You see, it is only now,
before the upcoming battle,

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,488
that I'd like to ask you out on a date.

10
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,534
Have you told everyone about this?

11
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:35,077
I haven't.

12
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,829
Why would you take me
on a date, though?

13
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,790
So you wouldn't date me?

14
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,959
I didn't say that I wouldn't.

15
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:45,504
But if you want to date someone,

16
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,422
there must be someone else beside me.

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,174
I can't do that.

18
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,010
You <i>are</i> the only person
I'd want to date right now, Reine.

19
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,224
Let's set the schedule.

20
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,434
Where would you take me for a date?

21
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:20,414
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

22
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:26,169
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

23
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:31,633
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

24
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:37,139
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

25
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:43,437
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

26
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:51,528
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

27
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:57,618
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

28
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:03,790
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

29
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,087
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

30
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:13,091
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

31
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:17,638
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

32
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:24,519
<i>in our hands alight</i>

33
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:34,696
I see.

34
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,533
Reine is your best friend, after all.

35
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:42,913
I think it's shocking for you
to suddenly be told this story.

36
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:43,705
But...

37
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:49,127
Thanks. It must be
tough for you too, right?

38
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,254
Thanks for telling me this, though.

39
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,714
Kotori...

40
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:57,177
<i>Now, let's plan countermeasures
before Reine notices.</i>

41
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,555
Yeah. You're right.

42
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,809
Anyway, we need to think about
what your date with Reine

43
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,936
is going to be like by morning.

44
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:11,066
At the same time, we need to work
on the operation against DEM.

45
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:13,568
You're right.
And also...

46
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,238
Oh? Is it about the spirits?

47
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:17,197
Yeah.

48
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:22,244
For them, I believe Reine was a reliable
and trustworthy older sister figure.

49
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,789
If they knew that
she had betrayed them...

50
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,711
Yes, I know, but they
have to get over it.

51
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:33,088
(Origami Tobiichi's - Incoming Call)

52
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,214
Origami?
(Origami Tobiichi's - Incoming Call)

53
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,340
(Origami Tobiichi's - Incoming Call)

54
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:39,177
<i>I've heard about the thing.</i>

55
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,262
What?

56
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:42,806
<i>The spirits have been informed
of the situation.</i>

57
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,892
<i>We will help you to plan the date.</i>

58
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,602
Wait! Hold on!

59
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,564
How on earth could you know
about this already?

60
00:03:52,135 --> 00:03:53,442
Shido.

61
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,693
Check your second shirt button.

62
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,485
Huh?

63
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,987
Whoa!

64
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,490
I've got the whole situation figured out!

65
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,243
We asked Origami.

66
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:06,872
I'm surprised, but
it isn't the time to be upset.

67
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:11,209
I don't even know what's going on,
but the situation is getting hotter.

68
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,628
It's not that I hate it, though!

69
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,548
Hmph! As expected of
Reine Murasame!

70
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:19,468
I'd never thought she'd deceive
the vigorous Kaguya Yamai!

71
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:23,263
Petition. Let us help you.

72
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:27,684
Okay. Then we'll meet
in the briefing room.

73
00:04:27,685 --> 00:04:30,257
To disguise our intentions
in case we run into Reine,

74
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:31,855
make sure to move one at a time.

75
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,484
Kotori, can you give me a minute?

76
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:36,401
What?

77
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,945
I've got something to do.

78
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:44,868
We need to talk.

79
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,329
I know you're there, Kurumi.

80
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,712
It's you, huh?

81
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:59,591
Oh, dear, it's very unusual of you.

82
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,969
I can't believe you called me, Shido.

83
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,430
Are you the only one here right now?

84
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,558
Is the real Kurumi listening
to our conversation?

85
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:11,728
You're asking me
some strange questions.

86
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:17,526
There are no other alter ego,
or even real me here.

87
00:05:17,526 --> 00:05:21,947
If there's a story you don't want
my real self to hear,

88
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:24,366
that's completely okay.

89
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,743
I see.

90
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:31,623
I don't know if it's safe
to tell the real Kurumi

91
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:33,375
what I'm about to tell you.

92
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,126
So...

93
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,587
Could you help me make a decision?

94
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,884
On 20 February,
the main body of Kurumi...

95
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,427
...will die.

96
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,808
You speak as if you have
seen it all, huh?

97
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:52,060
Yes, you guessed it.

98
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,064
Can you tell me who's the killer?

99
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,609
Even if Ellen Mathers were to
be our opponent later on,

100
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:04,406
we would not be so easy
to defeat, you know?

101
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,033
It's Mio Takamiya.

102
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,621
The Spirit of Origin
is going to kill Kurumi.

103
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:15,333
On the battlefield of the future,
Mio suddenly appeared out of Kurumi...

104
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,880
I believe Mio should
already be inside Kurumi now.

105
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:23,174
I get it now.

106
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,969
I appreciate it.

107
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:31,433
Certainly, this is not information
that can be handled carelessly.

108
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,976
What do you think?

109
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,813
Can you tell Kurumi about this
without Mio realizing?

110
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:38,940
Maybe...

111
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,820
The only question is
how to deal with it afterward...

112
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,488
I know, right?

113
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,325
I wish there was
something I could do, but...

114
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,121
Don't look so gloomy, please.

115
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,667
Sure, it's a desperate situation,

116
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:01,838
but thanks to you
I have a choice now.

117
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,842
Shido.

118
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:10,096
Has the future me fulfilled my duty?

119
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,101
Yeah. You were amazing.

120
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,979
I see.

121
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,206
R-Reine?! What are you doing?

122
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,333
Doing my job, obviously.

123
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,544
I thought I'd get
tomorrow's work done, too.

124
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:43,838
And I've finished it.

125
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,424
Oh really?
You've been working hard, then.

126
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,302
What about you, Tohka?
Why are you still awake at this hour?

127
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,972
Well, uhh, you know...

128
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,518
If you're looking for evening meals,
go to the canteen or the rest area.

129
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,231
But our time is regulated,
so be moderate.

130
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,484
Don't forget to brush
your teeth before sleep.

131
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,987
Y-Yeah, I'll be paying attention.

132
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,241
I know you can't sleep, but rest well.

133
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:17,247
After all, we must protect Shin
from the DEM at all costs.

134
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,129
Reine.

135
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,001
Hmm?

136
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,504
Reine, do you love Shido?

137
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,422
Huh?

138
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:27,799
What do you mean?

139
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,427
Come on, just answer it. Please.

140
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,638
Well, yeah.
I love him.

141
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:38,393
I see.
Me too.

142
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,024
I mean...

143
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,988
I might just be overthinking it.

144
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:57,037
<i>Hello Shido. How's the
bone-conduction headset working?</i>

145
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:01,166
I can hear it well. It feels a bit
different from usual, though.

146
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,294
<i>If we use an intercom,
Reine will find it out, obviously.</i>

147
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,589
<i>But with this, you don't have to worry
about being noticed.</i>

148
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,203
<i>She should be there by now, get ready.</i>

149
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:11,176
Got you.

150
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,553
Hey. Did I make you wait?

151
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,767
R-Reine...

152
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:35,074
It's time.
Let's get started!

153
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,451
All right!

154
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,580
Let's start our date!

155
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,917
To be honest, I still can't believe it.

156
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,969
I can't believe that Reine
is actually the Phantom!

157
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,222
I feel the same way, you know.

158
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,849
But we have to accept the facts.

159
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,812
But it's not so depressing, actually.

160
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:09,609
According to the boy, it's true that Reine
feels friendship towards us, isn't it?

161
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,361
Exactly.

162
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,156
The point is that if Shido makes
Reine fall in love and seals her,

163
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:17,242
everything will be fine.

164
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,869
What's wrong, Shin?

165
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,871
Did I surprise you that much?

166
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,124
Uhm, well, uhh...

167
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:24,999
(1. Sorry, I was admiring you, Reine.)

168
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:25,708
(2. Your hair is different
from usual. It's lovely.)

169
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,668
(3. How do you want me
to take off that dress?)

170
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,336
All hands, select!

171
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,712
-Yeah!
-Let's go!

172
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,338
(1. Sorry, I was admiring you, Reine.)

173
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,172
(2. Your hair is different
from usual. It's lovely.)

174
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:31,965
(3. How do you want me
to take off that dress?)

175
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,717
Number one, huh?
It's pretty much in order.

176
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:39,639
Yes. I think that silence makes
people feel insecure.

177
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,976
But I thought she'd
be happy to hear him say this.

178
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,354
What's with that caring?
Are you a goddess?

179
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,190
I might seem weird
for choosing this option,

180
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,860
thinking he should
look at this part first.

181
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,488
Well, this should convince Reine!

182
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,868
Hmm. But Muku thinks
the number two is not so bad.

183
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,995
Well, it is what it is.

184
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,081
Certainly! God dwells in the details.

185
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,834
The ability to notice
small changes is important.

186
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,751
But!

187
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,919
Addition.

188
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:15,216
Some people might perceive even minor
changes in hairstyle as not quite right.

189
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,511
Perhaps it's best to start with a safety
measure and see how things go.

190
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:22,015
And what about those three over there?

191
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:25,393
Oh, obviously I chose number three!

192
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,271
If a seemingly innocent boy
like him suddenly caught her off guard,

193
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,398
she'd be totally aroused, wouldn't she?

194
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,903
Exactly! Reine is a mature woman,

195
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,156
so she'd totally appreciate
this level of wit!

196
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,033
I mean,

197
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,287
our future depends on this,
could you please take this seriously?

198
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,289
I know.

199
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:50,793
That's why I chose the option that would
make me happiest if someone said it to me.

200
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,797
Shido.
It's number one.

201
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,717
Ah, I'm sorry.

202
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,845
Because I had never seen you
wearing such an outfit before,

203
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,888
I was, well...

204
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,307
captivated by you, Reine.

205
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:07,810
Really?

206
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,355
I see.

207
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,442
Thank you.
You look good in that outfit, too.

208
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,945
Thank you.

209
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:20,073
All right, where are we going today?

210
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,450
It seems like quite
a heavy load you're carrying.

211
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,912
It's still a secret.
I want to surprise you, Reine.

212
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,207
Will you trust me and come along?

213
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,792
Yes, of course.

214
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,127
Shall we go now―

215
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,213
Is there anything wrong?

216
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,675
I guess this was technically a date, huh?

217
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,970
Indeed. Though I didn't mean
it to be just 'technically'.

218
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,472
Yup.
If so, then...

219
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,734
Shall we go?

220
00:12:57,369 --> 00:12:58,222
Yes!

221
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,907
Affection level stats...

222
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,742
It's a strange waveform, isn't it?

223
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:08,621
She's overflowing with affection, almost
like he could seal it away right now.

224
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,624
And yet, there's no indication
of any sealable response.

225
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:16,587
It feels like she's keeping a distance
despite harboring affection.

226
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:21,384
It's like warmly watching them
on stage from the wings.

227
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,387
It's like a motherly feeling, I guess?

228
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:27,557
Indeed, quite aptly put.

229
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:28,641
Regardless,

230
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,395
it seems it remains
a challenging issue.

231
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,399
This is...

232
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,027
Reine's affinity has increased!

233
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,654
It seems the commander's
strategy has paid off!

234
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,282
It's not just my idea, though.

235
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:49,037
Last night, I stayed up late with all
spirits to plan this, and it's paid off.

236
00:13:49,037 --> 00:13:51,956
A day trip to
a hot spring on a holiday,

237
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,043
indeed, that's an enticing choice.

238
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:59,881
After all, Analyst Murasame works
the hardest within the Fraxinus.

239
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:04,677
Moreover, she also works as
a teacher at Raizen High School.

240
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,680
And for decades,
she has continued to work

241
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,184
towards the revival of Shinji Takamiya.

242
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,937
Even for spirits,
it's only natural to be exhausted.

243
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:19,609
Well, Reine always had dark circles
under her eyes, didn't she?

244
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,820
I always thought that
her work was always tough.

245
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,699
Yeah, she probably didn't get
much sleep every day.

246
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,453
Not just her body,
but her mind must be exhausted too.

247
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,580
And I suppose what Reine needs is...

248
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,956
...relaxation!

249
00:14:34,332 --> 00:14:36,834
She can relieve all that
accumulated fatigue and weariness

250
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,213
with various relaxation facilities!

251
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:45,426
(1. Relax in the spacious communal bath.)
(2. Unwind in your own private outdoor bath.)

252
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,469
(3. Refresh with a massage.)

253
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,221
All hands, select!

254
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,597
- Yes!
- Yes!

255
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:51,349
(1. Relax in the spacious communal bath.
2. Unwind in your own private outdoor bath.)

256
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:51,849
(3. Refresh with a massage.)

257
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:54,102
Hmm...
It's number two, huh?

258
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:58,940
Well, the idea of Shido and Reine
bathing together is,

259
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,859
well, a bit awkward, isn't it?

260
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:07,490
Yes, I think it's better if the two of them
can have a good conversation together.

261
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,620
It's okay. I'm calm,
I'm calm, I'm calm.

262
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,331
Wait, why should you
say it three times?

263
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,709
Besides, I have experience being alone

264
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,378
with Shido in the bath.

265
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:24,048
I'm not the type to lose my calmness
over something like this.

266
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:28,678
Wait! Weren't you the one who was waiting
in ambush without his knowledge back then?

267
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,807
Hmph. When it comes to bathing,
we Yamai can't be ignored.

268
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,035
Agreement.

269
00:15:34,036 --> 00:15:37,437
Making Shido a sandwich by
squeezing him between me and Kaguya was...

270
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,063
a beautiful memory.

271
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,066
Since they've come all
the way to a hot spring inn

272
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,444
let them enjoy
some naked bonding time!

273
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,572
In a bath this size,
there's plenty of room

274
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:50,324
for Darling and Reine
to squeeze in a bit!

275
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,410
Isn't this the world's best

276
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,080
complete erotic bento box?!

277
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,207
Shido. It's number two.

278
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,709
Roger that.

279
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:09,552
Shin.

280
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,429
May I go in?

281
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,639
Uhm, yes, please.

282
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,058
Huh?!

283
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,560
Oh my goodness!

284
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,854
What?!

285
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,106
What on earth is going on?!

286
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,691
Analyst Murasame's body...

287
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,611
I mean, I can't see the important
walkthrough screen!

288
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:30,490
Oh my God!
Restore it right away!

289
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,785
<i>Our goal is for the spirits
to feel love and affection.</i>

290
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,662
<i>After sealing the spiritual power,</i>

291
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,374
<i>it would be wise for us not to do anything
that might make Reine uncomfortable.</i>

292
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,710
-No!
-No!

293
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,590
Kannazuki, you're calm, huh?

294
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,257
Oh.

295
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:53,763
Yes. I am not so much
interested in big breasts.

296
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:55,765
Oh, I see.

297
00:16:59,499 --> 00:17:02,271
It's just the two of us,
so it should be fine, right?

298
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,648
Huh?

299
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,774
Geez...

300
00:17:05,493 --> 00:17:07,246
You've got pretty enormous ones.

301
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:11,948
Uhm...

302
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,533
Reine,

303
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,410
when did you start working at Ratatoskr?

304
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,080
Probably since five or six years ago.

305
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,415
Around the same time when
Kotori was appointed

306
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,251
as the commander.

307
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,431
I see.

308
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:26,379
Well, uhh...

309
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,047
Thank you so much.

310
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,549
What for?

311
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,758
Well, I mean...

312
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,511
You've been supporting Kotori all along.

313
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,349
I haven't done much.

314
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,101
Even without me,

315
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,937
she would surely
have become a great commander.

316
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:48,150
Well, I won't deny that Kotori's
ability is exceptional...

317
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,069
But what did you do before that?

318
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,862
I was just an ordinary student.

319
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,076
My thesis was recognized,
and that's how I was scouted by Ratatoskr.

320
00:18:00,292 --> 00:18:01,919
Did you have someone

321
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,332
you liked or something?

322
00:18:06,522 --> 00:18:08,838
There was only one person.

323
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,289
Is that person―

324
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,056
It's not fair that I'm
the only one talking, huh?

325
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,024
Would you let me hear your story, too?

326
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:22,837
Eh?!

327
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:25,250
Uhm, okay...

328
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:29,567
I've been curious
to hear your story, too.

329
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,613
Do you remember anything
before being taken in

330
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,739
by the Itsuka family?

331
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:40,244
To be honest,

332
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,663
it seems like I don't have
very clear memories.

333
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,624
The thing I remember...

334
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,501
The feeling of being held
by warm hands,

335
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,838
and the warmth of embrace, followed by
a sense of loss as those hands vanish.

336
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:52,632
I'm sure that...

337
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,217
it was from my mother.

338
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,640
Do you resent your mother
for abandoning you?

339
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,515
What?!

340
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,143
Well, I don't harbor

341
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,895
any resentment.

342
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,899
There must have been
some circumstances.

343
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,027
She didn't abandon me out of choice.

344
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,364
Besides, I remember.

345
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,159
How gentle those hands
were when they held me.

346
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:22,514
I see...

347
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,631
Eek!

348
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,175
There, there.

349
00:19:36,935 --> 00:19:37,746
Hold on!

350
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,679
Reine?!

351
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,139
A little wouldn't hurt, right?

352
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,143
I may not be able to replace her, but...

353
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,311
Uhm...

354
00:19:50,544 --> 00:19:53,484
<i>Ellen, I'm sorry for the suddenness,</i>

355
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:55,361
<i>but I've decided to expedite our plans.</i>

356
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,987
<i>The situation has changed.</i>

357
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,575
<i>No, it seems like it's about
to change from now on.</i>

358
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,703
What do you mean, Ike?

359
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:08,040
<i>Oh my, I'm truly fortunate.</i>

360
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,501
<i>I've never felt such a fateful connection</i>

361
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:16,090
<i>to the Demon King in my hand,
Beelzebub, the Omniscient.</i>

362
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,383
Does that mean...

363
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:20,803
Beelzebub has discovered something new?

364
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,179
<i>That's right.</i>

365
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:27,351
<i>It seems we suffered
a painful defeat once.</i>

366
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,729
<i>In a future we're not aware of.</i>

367
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,192
But this time,
we can make the first move.

368
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,987
For now, prepare the power plant.

369
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,240
<i>We'll also need to
gather some talismans.</i>

370
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,744
Then, let's summon the Spirit of Origin.

371
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,912
Now, Ellen.

372
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:51,584
Let's change the future together.

373
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,273
What is it that you want to show, Shin?

374
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:16,150
We're almost there.

375
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,527
I'm sure you'll like it.

376
00:21:21,316 --> 00:21:22,425
Here we are.

377
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,492
You can open your eyes now.

378
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:36,412
This is...

379
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,423
The place I wanted to show you, Reine.

380
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,549
It's beautiful, right?

381
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:47,705
Yeah...

382
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,485
It's beautiful.

383
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,111
So beautiful.

384
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:55,022
(Episode 9: "The 'Second' Date")

385
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:12,957
<i>It's all gone by so naturally</i>

386
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:19,296
<i>Seeking out the simple happiness</i>

387
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:24,927
<i>The dry wind that asks</i>

388
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:30,099
<i>A flower fluttering in the air</i>

389
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:37,314
<i>One day, I'll keep it a secret</i>

390
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:43,028
<i>Those faint and vivid shadows</i>

391
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,906
<i>I'm still here and breathing</i>

392
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,451
<i>With the pain that never ceases</i>

393
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,496
<i>I'm still here</i>

394
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:58,377
<i>Waiting for you</i>

395
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,472
<i>We shall live in this world</i>

396
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:17,021
<i>With those simple happiness</i>

("The Battlefield That Shouldn't Exist")

398

<i>The final battle with Westcott.</i>

399
00:23:28,569 --> 00:23:32,411
<i>Who will grasp the future,
DEM or Ratatoskr?</i>

400
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,413
<i>Next, Episode 10,</i>

<i>The three siblings, united.</i>
