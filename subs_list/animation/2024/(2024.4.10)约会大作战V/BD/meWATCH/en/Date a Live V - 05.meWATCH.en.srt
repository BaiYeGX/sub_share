1
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:05,839
I will give birth again.

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,718
This time, I promise you won't die.

3
00:00:10,886 --> 00:00:13,972
This time, I promise
you won't be broken.

4
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,601
I will share my power with you.

5
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:20,348
Oh...

6
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:23,982
But I don't know if you could stand it

7
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,443
if I gave it to you all at once.

8
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:32,950
I should give you
the power little by little, bit by bit.

9
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,077
To do so,

10
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:37,829
let's spread the seed around the world.

11
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:43,794
In time, the power will become
acceptable in the human body.

12
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:49,132
You just have to
take it one piece at a time.

13
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:56,765
When you have all the power,
you will remember everything.

14
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:02,145
We shall always be able
to be together this time.

15
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:22,416
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

16
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:28,171
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

17
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:33,635
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

18
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:39,141
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

19
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:45,439
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

20
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:53,530
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

21
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:59,620
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

22
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:05,792
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

23
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:11,089
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

24
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:15,093
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

25
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:19,640
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

26
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,480
<i>in our hands alight</i>

27
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,336
Kurumi Tokisaki, I thank you.

28
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:53,423
You were my wonderful
friend right to the end.

29
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,728
Zaphkiel!

30
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,610
I'm sorry, Kurumi Tokisaki.

31
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,529
And also, thank you.

32
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:20,701
Thanks to you,
I could stand before him again.

33
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,787
Screw... you!

34
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:29,251
Shido, run away!

35
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:59,614
It's been a long time.
We finally meet...

36
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,365
Shin.

37
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,366
Shin?

38
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,959
Do you remember me?

39
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,570
Mio?!

40
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,972
Kurumi Tokisaki's
vital signs have disappeared.

41
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,183
It appears she has died completely.

42
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,436
W-What the hell is that thing?

43
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:32,153
Reine?

44
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,741
<i>Please, please deny me
my stupid idea.</i>

45
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,912
<i>Reine, you should correct me as usual!</i>

46
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:52,584
Kotori...
You are a really smart girl.

47
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:56,838
MARIA!

48
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,845
Thank you, Kotori.

49
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,597
Excuse me?

50
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,058
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

51
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:12,103
Thank you for
protecting Shin all this time.

52
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,232
Reine, who are <i>you,</i> actually?

53
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:21,488
I'm sure it's not too far off
from what you're imagining.

54
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:25,033
She is me and I'm her.

55
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,495
One will, two bodies.

56
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,581
I've got some work
to do over here too.

57
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,709
It was more convenient
to keep them separate.

58
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,130
Especially when it comes
to giving everyone Sephira.

59
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,466
Giving everyone the Sephira?!

60
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,635
So you're the Phantom!

61
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:48,515
Yes, and also the "Spirit of Origin,"
as Kurumi calls it.

62
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,853
Kotori, I enjoyed the days
I spent with you.

63
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,647
But it's over now.

64
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,523
Hey, what are you—?!

65
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,650
Reine!

66
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,540
All hands, proceed with the operation.

67
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,544
We lost one ally
and gained one enemy.

68
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,170
That is all.

69
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:23,049
<i>Oh, the recovery
was surprisingly virtuous.</i>

70
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,635
<i>I'm in charge of the ship's controls,</i>

71
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,680
<i>it was okay if you were
a bit more depressed.</i>

72
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,602
Hmph, if you're going to motivate me,
you could have done a bit better.

73
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,270
<i>My apologies.</i>

74
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,649
<i>I think I still need to learn more about
the subtleties of the human heart.</i>

75
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,114
Reine?

76
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,700
It's all good, Shin.

77
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,647
Mio?!

78
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,523
Shin...

79
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,234
Do you remember who I am?

80
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,071
I've always wanted to meet you.

81
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,949
I've missed you for a long, long time.

82
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,242
That's all...

83
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,995
I've ever lived for.

84
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,459
I have so much to tell you.

85
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,755
There are a lot of things
I haven't told you.

86
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:46,716
Oh, but it's okay.

87
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,303
This time, we'll be
together forever, Shin.

88
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,707
Me too.

89
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,724
I'm glad to see you, Mio.

90
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:56,017
Shin!

91
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,769
I'm sorry I left you
alone all these years

92
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:01,147
and made you feel lonely.

93
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,816
I'm so sorry

94
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,651
I was gone before you.

95
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,445
Oh, no. It's not your fault...

96
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,029
But!

97
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,990
What's this about?

98
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,741
What have you done

99
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:16,788
to bring me,
Shinji Takamiya, back to life?

100
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,081
Everything!

101
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:24,921
I did everything. I did everything
I needed to do to see you again, Shin.

102
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,801
Shin, are you okay?

103
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,930
Mio, this is not good!

104
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,806
Huh?

105
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:37,684
You... can't do that.

106
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,519
Don't do that.

107
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,565
You should never sacrifice anyone,
for any purpose.

108
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,693
Yes. I guess you're right.

109
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,697
But then what was
I supposed to do?

110
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,033
All I had was only you, Shin.

111
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,703
If I lost you, there was
no point in living, Shin.

112
00:08:56,703 --> 00:09:00,331
But I am not weak like a human.

113
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,752
I wanted to die, but I couldn't.

114
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,505
I'm not strong like a human.

115
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,341
I couldn't forget you
whatsoever, Shin.

116
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,845
What am I supposed to do?

117
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:15,597
That's...

118
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,310
Sorry, I was being mean.

119
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,064
There was no way you could
have answered this question.

120
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,649
It's okay, Shin.

121
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,234
Leave it to me!

122
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,235
Mio?!

123
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:36,284
It's the final touch. Only your
memory as Shin will remain,

124
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,161
while other memories will be erased.

125
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,747
Just as I returned to be Mio.

126
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,499
You too must return to be Shin.

127
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,752
Thank you for everything.

128
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,377
Shido.

129
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,880
Shido!

130
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:51,633
Tohka!

131
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,385
Sorry I'm late, Shido!

132
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:58,098
I heard it on the intercom.
Was that really Reine?

133
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:01,142
Warning. Moreover, to think
that she is the Spirit of Origin

134
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,811
and also the Phantom is

135
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,521
too much of a greedy thing.

136
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,650
Shido!

137
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,276
Huh?!

138
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,946
Hold on for a moment,

139
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:13,780
Shin.

140
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,032
- Shido!
- Shido!

141
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,034
Where did you teleport him?!

142
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,370
To a safer place.

143
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,164
I shouldn't let him
get involved in our fight.

144
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,260
Ya-Yamabuki?!

145
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,427
Why are you here?

146
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,429
That's what I want to say!

147
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,182
Itsuka, where did you come from?!

148
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,518
Were you on the ceiling,
aiming at Ai this whole time?

149
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,896
You bastard! Are you saying that Tohka
and the other chicks aren't enough?

150
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,231
That's so lame!

151
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:51,234
What? Is this a spacequake shelter?

152
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,112
Geez, what are you yapping about?
Get off me, I'm scared!

153
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:54,696
Yamabuki!

154
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,739
Eek! W-What is it?!

155
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,700
Which shelter is this?!

156
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,995
What do you mean? Of course, it's
the shelter in the school basement!

157
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,330
School? I see...

158
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,126
That's quite a distance
from where I was.

159
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,421
Sorry, guys, just let me through!

160
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:13,381
I have to go!

161
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,634
You idiot!
The alarm hasn't been lifted yet!

162
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,803
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

163
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,472
I've got to go.

164
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,349
To Tohka and Origami!

165
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,017
Huh?

166
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,477
Ah, I see what is he trying to do.

167
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,022
We didn't see them earlier, did we?

168
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,733
To be honest, I thought they
went into another shelter.

169
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,444
- Kyaa!
- Got you!

170
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,780
Hey! What are you guys doing?!

171
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,490
T-Tonomachi!

172
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:42,410
Yamabuki. Hasakura. Fujibakama!

173
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:46,289
Hurry up! Tohka and the
others are running late, right?!

174
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:46,873
Hey!

175
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,250
You can thank me tomorrow for lunch!

176
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,668
That's so lame!

177
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:51,920
- You should have let us

178
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,631
- Hey, stop! Get off me!
- show off for a change!

179
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,799
- What are you girls doing?! Stop it!
- Miss, we're in a good scene right now,

180
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,051
- What are you girls doing?! Stop it!
- please go a bit easier on me!

181
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,302
- please go a bit easier on me!

182
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,054
Thanks y'all.

183
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,055
I appreciate it!

184
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,099
Hey, stop! You can't go, Itsuka!

185
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,478
The doors won't open
before the alarms are off!

186
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,022
Michael!

187
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,779
Lataib!

188
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,827
That's so lame...

189
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:28,135
Mio.

190
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,416
You're Reine, right?

191
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,919
Yes, I am.

192
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,087
Tohka.

193
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,464
Can't you reconsider your decision?

194
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,008
After all, I owe you a lot.

195
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,969
I wouldn't want to fight if I could.

196
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,724
I see.
How disappointing.

197
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,478
Wait a second!

198
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,522
You forgot about me,

199
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,775
and you're giving me the impression
that this is the final battle?!

200
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,403
Really, it can't be real!

201
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,910
Ain Soph Aur!

202
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:08,955
Huh?

203
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,165
What is this?

204
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,167
Blossom in full glory.

205
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,442
Bandersnatch squadron, destroyed!

206
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,861
Nibelcole disappearance
cannot be reproduced!

207
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,654
Ship No. 3, Galdrabók,

208
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,114
unable to hold territory!

209
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:43,990
We're going down!

210
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,249
She's finally here.

211
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,625
Deus!

212
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,253
My beloved spirit!

213
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,596
I feel really sorry for you guys.

214
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,600
So I wouldn't say "don't resist".

215
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,062
It is your right to do so.

216
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,732
Come on in,

217
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,902
my sweet little girls.

218
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,791
All right!

219
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,837
Are you okay, Origami?

220
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,007
Yeah. It looks like
the operation was a success.

221
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,220
So you are the one
who beat Artemisia.

222
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,766
I was surprised when the key
suddenly poked out of nowhere.

223
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,142
Hmm?

224
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,895
Uhmm... I was...

225
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:56,979
Gosh...

226
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,359
Seeing you from this distance,
you're really just a normal girl.

227
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,750
They said you were hostile life forms
whom we can't communicate with,

228
00:15:04,751 --> 00:15:06,155
and just doesn't
make any sense now.

229
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,410
Bombardment?!

230
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,536
Origami!

231
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,042
Defensive formation!

232
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,174
No way... Run!

233
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,061
Wai... Mike?!

234
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,480
What is happening?

235
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,565
She's dead?!

236
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,570
I'm sure Mister was over there!

237
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,737
Let's go!

238
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,782
Captain, take care of
Mike and the others.

239
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,953
Medical facilities in Fraxinus
might be able to resuscitate her.

240
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,455
Fraxinus?

241
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,499
It is the flagship of
the fleet fighting the DEM.

242
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,085
I've got to go to Shido right now.

243
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,801
That's a hell of a lot of magic power.

244
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,512
But your attacks are too linear.

245
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,391
I know you're happy to see me
again after all these years,

246
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:18,227
but you need to relax a bit, Ellen.

247
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,688
You're still as young as ever.

248
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,984
Well, I can't exactly judge
anyone else now.

249
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,068
Shut up!

250
00:16:28,141 --> 00:16:29,167
Why?!

251
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:32,325
Why the hell did you betray us, Elliot?!

252
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:36,329
We are the retribution
for every human being!

253
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,874
The vengeance! And we should
have sworn to rebel against them!

254
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,422
You have turned your back on our oath!

255
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,300
You manipulated my sister,
stole her research results

256
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,260
and became our enemy!

257
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,514
Know that even death
cannot atone for your sins!

258
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:57,767
I feel bad for you and Ike.

259
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:58,893
Well,

260
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,771
I didn't mean to manipulate Karen.

261
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:06,108
I mean, I found myself next to her,
all packed up and ready to go...

262
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,110
Anyhow,

263
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,197
I didn't want to antagonize you.

264
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,950
Your path and mine

265
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,160
just collided in a weird way.

266
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,161
Bullshit!

267
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,081
I have not forgotten the hatred I felt

268
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,792
for the burning of my village

269
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,293
and the slaughter of my people.

270
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,337
But...

271
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,716
Have you noticed that, too, Ellen?

272
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:33,553
This outrageous spirit force is...

273
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,679
Deus!

274
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,559
Yeah, exactly.

275
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,685
When I saw that spirit,

276
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,687
I thought like this...

277
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:44,918
"Oh,

278
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,275
it's beautiful."

279
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,280
And, no matter how much
it was for revenge,

280
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,741
was it right to sacrifice such a child
who had nothing to do with it?

281
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,162
How is that any different
from the people

282
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,582
who burned our homes?

283
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,294
You have always been pure

284
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,545
and straightforward.

285
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,423
The foremost amongst the three of us.

286
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:12,393
Maybe,

287
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,720
it's us who have changed.

288
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,640
But I still

289
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,727
consider you and Ike my friends.

290
00:18:23,696 --> 00:18:25,319
That is the only thing
that remains the same.

291
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,232
I believe Karen thinks so, too.

292
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,734
What are you talking about?!

293
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,500
If you can't forgive me, so be it.

294
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,880
But... I'd like to at least have
a chance to meet Karen―

295
00:18:49,881 --> 00:18:50,963
Chastiefol!

296
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,386
Go through, Rhongomiant!

297
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,555
Gungnir!

298
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,577
Kaguya. Yuzuru.

299
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,495
Can you do it?

300
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,706
W-Who do you think
you're talking to?

301
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,583
It's not a problem at all!

302
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,586
Agree. No matter
how formidable the enemy,

303
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,005
there is no way the Yamai sisters
will back down.

304
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,131
Got you.

305
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:49,563
Tohka, that won't defeat me.

306
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,982
Yeah, I'm sure you're right.

307
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,278
Raphael!

308
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:58,322
Calling!
El Kanaph!

309
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,581
What a brilliant surprise attack.

310
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,332
But...

311
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,202
Sandalphon!

312
00:20:11,203 --> 00:20:12,795
Halvanhelev!

313
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,068
Kaguya! Behind you!

314
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:53,794
K-Kaguya?!

315
00:20:55,044 --> 00:20:55,963
Yu...

316
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,965
zu...

317
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,219
Kaguya...
Kaguya?! Kaguya!

318
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,764
Hang in there!

Kaguya!
Kaguya!

320

Kaguya!

321
00:21:12,681 --> 00:21:13,887
I hope there's still time.

322
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,829
What happened?
What the hell is going on?!

323
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,260
Well, Shido Itsuka.

324
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,764
Let's decide here, shall we?

325
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:50,643
Which of us is worthy
to have the power...

326
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,852
of the Spirit?
