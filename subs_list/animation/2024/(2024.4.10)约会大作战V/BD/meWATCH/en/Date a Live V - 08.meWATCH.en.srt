1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,927
<i>What happened to me?</i>

2
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,513
<i>Where am I?</i>

3
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,850
<i>Shido... and Mio Takamiya...</i>

4
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,978
<i>Oh, I'm so sleepy...</i>

5
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,773
<i>No... I can't...</i>

6
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:24,650
<i>I need...</i>

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,238
<i>I need to get back
to Shido right away...</i>

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,285
Will you fall?
Well, that's okay too.

9
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:37,960
Who is there?

10
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,831
Who are you?

11
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,000
My name, huh?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,710
I don't have such a thing.

13
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:46,380
As far as I'm concerned,

14
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:49,800
I'm you.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,884
Me?

16
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:54,012
What on earth is going on?

17
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,682
Is this a dream?

18
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,601
It is probably not far off the mark.

19
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:05,691
There's a difference, though,
in your head and in that woman's.

20
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:07,234
That woman?

21
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:09,570
Do you mean Mio Takamiya?

22
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:13,782
Where is everyone?! If I'm here,

23
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,450
are they here too?

24
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,870
You are the only one alive here.

25
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,584
The others died as human beings

26
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,086
when that woman took their Sephira.

27
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,971
Wait. As a human being?
What do you mean?

28
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:39,141
It is true that Origami, Kotori and
the others are former humans,

29
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:44,730
but Yoshino, Kaguya, Yuzuru and Natsumi
are pure spirits just like me, right?

30
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,106
No.

31
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,568
The beings called spirits
other than that woman

32
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,614
are merely human beings
who were given Sephira by her.

33
00:01:53,614 --> 00:02:00,120
The ones you just named have only
lost their memories of being human.

34
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,996
Wha...

35
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:04,333
All spirits...
are all originally human...?

36
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:09,129
Actually, Nia did say
something like that,

37
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,007
but if that was true,

38
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,384
why am I still alive?

39
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:18,680
If I were human too,
I would have died as a human

40
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,017
like everyone else as soon as
my Sephira was taken from me!

41
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,895
I will tell you.

42
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,064
It's because...

43
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:46,500
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,214
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

45
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:57,678
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

46
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:03,183
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,481
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

48
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:17,572
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

49
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:23,745
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

50
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:29,918
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

51
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:35,132
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

52
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:39,136
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

53
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:44,015
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

54
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:50,564
<i>in our hands alight</i>

55
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:07,330
What I just said is everything
that I understand.

56
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,251
Hm...

57
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,473
I thought you'd be confused,

58
00:04:14,474 --> 00:04:18,216
but you took it much faster
than I thought you would.

59
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,178
Well, I am confused.

60
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:26,433
But if that's true,
now I'm thankful for that fact.

61
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,225
Oh?

62
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:30,270
I am alive in this way.

63
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,483
And if I am alive,
I can still fight.

64
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,777
The enemy is our mother.

65
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,821
Even if we could fight her,
we would never be able to defeat her.

66
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:43,366
The most we can do is buy
a few minutes of time at most.

67
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,745
Next time, she will wipe us out, leaving
not even a shred of consciousness behind.

68
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,582
I wouldn't mind. As long as
we can buy a few minutes,

69
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,251
Shido may be able to escape.

70
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,881
Maybe they can come up with something
to help us out of this situation.

71
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:02,302
It's reason enough to hope,
to bet my life on it.

72
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,720
Oh?

73
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:11,019
But if you die,
it means that I will also perish.

74
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,355
Because I am you, after all.

75
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,775
I-Is that so? That is...

76
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:17,776
Ugh...

77
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,778
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:24,699
But don't you want me to fight too?

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,661
Huh? And why do you think so?

80
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:31,790
Because you've been
calling out to me.

81
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,337
That's true.

82
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,423
Yeah, you're right.

83
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,222
Then off you go, dear me.

84
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:49,933
Go wild until you've had your fill.

85
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:53,103
Yeah. Thank you, myself.

86
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,032
Is everyone...

87
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:07,576
dead?

88
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,287
No... way...

89
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,380
Shin,

90
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,048
I'm sorry.

91
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:27,012
I didn't want to
make you sad either...

92
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,598
But, it's okay.

93
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,475
Because that memory will soon be gone.

94
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,395
I am the only one
responsible for this sin.

95
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,274
So you don't need
to blame yourself, Shin.

96
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:41,902
I'm...

97
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,865
You will start all over
from that day...

98
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,825
the day you were shot
in front of me.

99
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,453
Starting all over again...

100
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,664
And forget about everything...

101
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,043
Yes, as Shinji Takamiya.

102
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,680
Shido!!!

103
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,437
Shido, are you okay?!

104
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,064
Tohka...

105
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,193
Nothing is over yet!

106
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:26,446
Now, stand up, Shido!

107
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,325
Tohka... Tohka!

108
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:32,243
I'm sorry, Tohka...

109
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,914
I almost gave up for a second―

110
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,082
What are you talking about?!

111
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,585
It is because you didn't give in
that you are alive right now, Shido!

112
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:43,004
What could be
a better result than that?!

113
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,217
Thanks, Tohka.

114
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:51,137
Really, you've been
helping me a lot, Tohka.

115
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,723
I, too, am relying on you, Shido.

116
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,352
Even now, I could come back
because of you, Shido.

117
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,730
Because of you, Shido,
I can stand in front of Mio.

118
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,857
Tohka...

119
00:08:04,112 --> 00:08:05,235
Yeah!

120
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:09,239
I see... it is you after all, Tohka.

121
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:14,661
I suppose so, if anyone is going
to stand up against me,

122
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:17,747
I was sure that would be you.

123
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,828
I divided my power
into ten Sephirahs

124
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:25,630
and gave them to humans
and created spirits.

125
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:33,638
But for some unknown reason, one of
the sephira has developed an ego.

126
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,517
Just like when I was born that day.

127
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:42,272
Shin, I'm sure you've noticed that too.

128
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:45,275
The difference between Tohka
and the other spirits.

129
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,863
What the other spirits had
and Tohka didn't have.

130
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,533
Her name...

131
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,284
Right.

132
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:58,204
All of the spirits were once human.

133
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,583
So they had a name from the beginning.

134
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,337
However, Tohka is different.

135
00:09:05,338 --> 00:09:07,547
Only I and Tohka are.

136
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:12,969
There are times I am confused. I have
suffered from not having a name.

137
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,515
However, I am now grateful
for that fact.

138
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:22,395
Since I didn't have a name,
Shido was able to give me a name.

139
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:27,734
Because I wasn't human, I was able
to stand in front of Shido like this!

140
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:35,158
I'm slightly off schedule,
but well, it's okay.

141
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,869
The outcome will be no different.

142
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,438
Ah...

143
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,775
We did it, Shido!
Our attack has gone through!

144
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,568
Yeah. Wait...

145
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,029
It looks like there's
no damage at all...

146
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,197
What are you saying?

147
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:18,576
Not even Halvanhelev was able to put
a scratch on her just a few minutes ago!

148
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:23,206
I see, this seems a little tricky.

149
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,835
My apologies, Tohka.
I have to be serious from now on.

150
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,962
I will do everything

151
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,464
to take Shin away from you.

152
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,841
I won't let you!

153
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,343
Shido is mine!

154
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,852
I see, this is...

155
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:53,820
Does that mean that
when you escaped from me,

156
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,489
you took the Spiritual Power
of the other spirits and me?

157
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,867
And that's why you have
so much power...

158
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,038
What are you...

159
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,336
You are the only pure spirit
that exists besides me,

160
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,794
you are like a copy of me, in a way.

161
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:18,219
Perhaps it's only natural
that you could do what I did...

162
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,847
Tohka! I will assist you!

163
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:35,317
Ugh!

164
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:54,672
After all, despair does not suit you.

165
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:56,799
Tohka!

166
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,427
Sandalphon!

167
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,764
Halvanhelev, huh?

168
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,516
Ain Soph Aur: Henet.

169
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,353
Ratelibish!

170
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,911
Splendid, Tohka...

171
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:13,334
I will respond in kind to your
noble hearts and thoughts.

172
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,091
Ain...

173
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,983
Tohka?

174
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:40,236
Tohka is already gone.

175
00:13:40,808 --> 00:13:41,738
Huh?

176
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:45,867
The Angel of nothingness, Ain,
defies all reason...

177
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,745
...and annihilates all things.

178
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:53,249
Tohka is gone.
Nowhere in this world.

179
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:59,297
I wasn't going to use this angel,
because Tohka's Spiritual Power...

180
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:02,133
would disappear with her...

181
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,096
I had no choice if I wanted to
make sure I could finish off Tohka.

182
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:13,519
On the contrary,
that's how far Tohka had driven me.

183
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,689
Please praise Tohka.

184
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:21,652
She has surpassed her own limits
just because of her feelings for you.

185
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:27,533
Well, Shin. There's really
no one left in our way now.

186
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:33,373
The power you have now is enough
to make a body that won't kill you.

187
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,291
Now all that's left...

188
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,919
...is to return you to a perfect Shin.

189
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,923
Metatron!

190
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,178
Camael!

191
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,556
Zadkiel!

192
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:57,079
Gabriel!

193
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,356
Raphael!

194
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,027
Haniel!

195
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,368
Michael!

196
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,207
It's futile.

197
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,878
This is...

198
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:25,133
I'm sorry. It's a hassle if you
jump around too much.

199
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,260
Now, Shin...

200
00:15:34,715 --> 00:15:35,744
What?

201
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,693
It looks like I've made it in time.

202
00:15:43,693 --> 00:15:47,447
Shido, I'm glad you're still alive.

203
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,531
Kurumi?!

204
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:52,743
W-What's going on?
Wasn't you killed by Mio?

205
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,038
I am sorry for disappointing you, Shido.

206
00:15:56,038 --> 00:16:00,418
I really wish I could have rushed
over a little earlier.

207
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,795
Since this was the first time I did it,

208
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,174
I couldn't get a good sense of it.

209
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:09,051
What does that...

210
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,387
Yud Aleph, huh?

211
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,431
You got that right.

212
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:18,936
The eleventh bullet, which sends
the target of the shot into the future.

213
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:25,610
I am an alter ego of Kurumi Tokisaki,
who was entrusted with the future

214
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,321
from about an hour ago using Yud Aleph.

215
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,573
Zafkiel...

216
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,879
Yeah, yeah, you've entrusted
the future to me,

217
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:46,255
my dear self...

218
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:53,012
I was sent to kill you,

219
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,972
as the last assassin!

220
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,184
Are you really serious?

221
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,270
Do you think an alter ego like you
can beat me?

222
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:07,610
I can exist until the Spiritual Power
contained in Yud Aleph is exhausted.

223
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:11,697
That's long enough to kill you!

224
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,456
Kurumi, what are you...

225
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:26,295
I told you already.
I have come to defeat, Mio.

226
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,965
Oh, and one more thing.

227
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:35,346
Perhaps you couldn't forget
the feeling of kissing Shido.

228
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,224
Kurumi!

229
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,530
Kurumi!

230
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,870
Too... bad...

231
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,998
I couldn't defeat...

232
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,583
...her...

233
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,682
This time everything is taken care of.

234
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,268
I admire everyone's feelings.

235
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,230
But all resistance is futile.

236
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,315
Futile?

237
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,777
It's not futile.
Because they were all there...

238
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,574
Because Tohka had fought with you,
Kurumi was able to get here in time.

239
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,326
And then Kurumi...

240
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,078
made me realize...

241
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,250
Origami, Nia, Yoshino, Kotori,

242
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,713
Mukuro, Natsumi, Kaguya, Yuzuru,

243
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,633
Miku, and Tohka...

244
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:57,136
Nobody's Angel was
good enough to defeat you.

245
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:02,350
But there was one more
Angel left in me.

246
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:06,103
The power of Angel,
which I have never used yet.

247
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:12,401
Kurumi... sent her alter ego
to remind me of that!

248
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,407
Zafkiel.

249
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:21,035
Vav!

250
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,189
<i>But what should I do?</i>

251
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,858
<i>How can I prevent Mio's movement?</i>

252
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:56,570
<i>Mio should already be
inside Kurumi at this point.</i>

253
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:01,575
<i>If I made a poor move, she would
realize what I was trying to do.</i>

254
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,785
Shido?

255
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,957
What are you doing here?

256
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,208
Tohka...

257
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,837
Ah! S-Shido?!

258
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,464
Tohka... Tohka...

259
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:22,596
Mhm, it's me.
What's going on, Shido?

260
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,683
Tohka... I...

261
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:30,312
had a dream.

262
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,147
A dream?

263
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,734
Yeah, it's a bad dream.

264
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,612
Where everyone is killed
in a battle with the DEMs.

265
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,407
I couldn't do anything.

266
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,618
Even though you did your best, Tohka...

267
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,495
Shido...

268
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:52,626
It's okay. It won't happen.

269
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,712
Tohka...

270
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,092
You have saved me, Shido.

271
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:04,764
You did not call me, a spirit, as an enemy,
but you reached out to me.

272
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:10,144
I promised to protect you
no matter what, Shido.

273
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:15,333
Besides, you are the one who
has faced me and other spirits, Shido.

274
00:21:15,334 --> 00:21:18,527
There's no way that DEMs
are going to beat you now.

275
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:20,905
That might be tru―

276
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:24,658
Is something wrong, Shido?

277
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:30,039
Thank you, Tohka. Thanks to you,
I think I know what I need to do.

278
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,834
Huh? I don't really understand...

279
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,461
Well, then good for you!

280
00:21:39,891 --> 00:21:40,800
Reine!

281
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:42,504
Huh?

282
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:47,515
What's the matter, Shin?

283
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:48,808
Reine,

284
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,311
would you like to go on a date
with me tomorrow?
