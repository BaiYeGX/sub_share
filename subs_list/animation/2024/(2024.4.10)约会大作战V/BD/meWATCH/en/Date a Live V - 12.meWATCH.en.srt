(Episode 12: "And The One She Chooses")

14
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,976
An entity who can kill me, huh...

15
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,312
Maybe you were right.

16
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,397
Maybe that is...

17
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,525
what I have been hoping for all along.

18
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,902
Mio...

19
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:55,657
I'm not lying about
trying to revive Shin.

20
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,829
I've lived all this time
to see Shin once again.

21
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,374
However, you are right, Shido...

22
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:10,505
Part of me was wondering, "Is it truly
Shin that was born in that way?"

23
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:13,070
But...

24
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,179
I didn't know what else to do...

25
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,809
I see, maybe...

26
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,312
I really did want to die all along.

27
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:33,862
Why didn't I notice
something so simple?

28
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:42,204
The fact that you kissed me
knowing that much...

29
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:47,709
You are trying to kill me,
aren't you, Shido?

30
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:51,713
Yeah...

31
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,716
Did you...

32
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:56,718
expect me to say that?

33
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,474
I'm sorry, but I don't have
as much guts as you do.

34
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,102
I can't bear your death.

35
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,354
You know, Mio...

36
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:11,983
I'm here to take you away from Shinji!

37
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:18,031
I have the ten Sephiras in my body now.

38
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,867
I might even be able to seal
your spiritual power.

39
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,079
But "sealing" your power
should not equal "death".

40
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,165
If you hadn't chosen death yourself.

41
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,127
With that being said...

42
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,342
Just forget about your ex-boyfriend
and switch to me,

43
00:03:37,802 --> 00:03:38,812
Mio.

44
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:52,065
What's with that?
It doesn't suit you at all, Shido.

45
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,985
I mean, are you even serious?

46
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:57,821
W-Whether it suits me or not...

47
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,072
I'm serious!

48
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,867
I'm seriously going
to take you away from Shinji!

49
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,585
I see.

50
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,330
That's what he said.

51
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,499
So, what will you do, Shin?

52
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,835
Do you want me to say something?

53
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,839
I'm just someone who is
detached from Shido's memory.

54
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:18,884
A phony of a phony, you know?

55
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:23,054
But it's Shin's memory, right?

56
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,139
Just say it.

57
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,393
Because what you think should be
the same as the real Shin.

58
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,022
Otherwise, I might be taken
by Shido, you know?

59
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,865
Oh, well.

60
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,528
Then, let me say this in return.

61
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,782
Don't mess with me, idiot!

62
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,701
You just saying whatever you want
when others keep their mouths shut!

63
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,495
I can't stand it, even if you were me!

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,915
I will never...

65
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:52,918
give Mio to you!

66
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,381
Well, this is how I felt before I died.

67
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,133
It's just...

68
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:02,344
I'm already a goner, right?

69
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:10,060
Honestly, the thought of Mio choosing
someone other than me makes my heart burst.

70
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,564
But even so, I don't want Mio
to choose her own death.

71
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:19,528
There were still many things in this world
that I wanted to show to Mio.

72
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,074
This sea is beautiful.

73
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,911
I am so glad I was able
to bring Mio here.

74
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:32,791
But it's time to go somewhere else.

75
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,377
I'm sorry, Mio.

76
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,630
I've been holding you back
for a long time now.

77
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:45,679
Mio...

78
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,641
Shido... I...

79
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,894
W-What's happening?!

80
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,688
Reine, is this...

81
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,606
It's external interference.

82
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,900
Perhaps a Spirit Formula.

83
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,527
Spirit Formula?

84
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,613
This is the formula
that once created the spirit,

85
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,575
or in other words,
my existence, in this world.

86
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,243
It's the secret art of witchcraft.

87
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:13,540
As far as I know,
only Westcott can do this.

88
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,083
Hold on!

89
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:19,588
Are you saying that a new spirit is
being created out there right now?

90
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,881
Looks like it.

91
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,758
A Spirit of Origin like me.

92
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:28,638
Moreover, it seems that Westcott is
at the center of that power.

93
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:33,810
Apparently, he is trying to perform
the formula using himself as the core.

94
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:39,858
Does that mean that Westcott will get
the power of Spirit of Origin?

95
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,484
The same power as Mio?

96
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,364
Yes.

97
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:48,241
Now a huge flow of spiritual power
has appeared here, which is me.

98
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:53,872
Westcott intends to use this flow
to make himself the Spirit of Origin.

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,252
Now he no longer
needs the ten Sephira.

100
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,506
He can just use the power
that appears here.

101
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,177
Could it be that Westcott
had planned this all along―

102
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,762
Perhaps.

103
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,140
He must have known
about this situation beforehand.

104
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,184
It's my fault...

105
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,771
Because of what I went through in the future,
he knew about it from Beelzebub.

106
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,649
No, if you're talking about the cause,

107
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,151
it's entirely my fault.

108
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:27,447
Besides, now is not
the time for regrets, right?

109
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,531
That's right!

110
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,118
I don't want to be taken
advantage of by that guy,

111
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,538
and I don't want my world of
memories with Shin to be remade.

112
00:07:36,283 --> 00:07:38,399
Shido, lend me your strength.

113
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,754
It may sound strange coming
from me who killed the spirits

114
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,965
in the future world, but...

115
00:07:46,005 --> 00:07:47,682
Let's go and save everyone!

116
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,427
Yeah!

117
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:51,308
Shin.

118
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:52,355
Right.

119
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:54,674
I'll be going.

120
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,435
Yeah, take care.

121
00:07:58,383 --> 00:07:59,312
Shido.

122
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,689
Huh?!

123
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,273
Um...

124
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,068
Then, excuse me...

125
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,196
Thanks for the wonderful date.

126
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,073
Reine...

127
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,367
You will be fine.

128
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,498
Then, let's go.

129
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes!

130
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,263
Shido!

131
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,514
- Mister!
- Shido!

132
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,640
Brother!

133
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,516
Shido!

134
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,268
Sorry for the wait, everyone!

135
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,522
Yo, Isaac Westcott.

136
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:47,277
It looks like you've been doing whatever
you wanted while we were gone.

137
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,071
I really appreciate your help,

138
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,364
Shido Itsuka.

139
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:58,496
You stopped Deus while I was
invoking my formula.

140
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:00,915
Ah...

141
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,417
Belial!

142
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,930
Belial?

143
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,766
It's a Demon King.

144
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:22,270
It has a power comparable
to Mio's Angel...

145
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,608
Shido, this is...

146
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:27,650
He's...

147
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,029
trying to completely remake this world...

148
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,531
Mio?

149
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,075
Ain Soph!

150
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,835
Mio!

151
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,337
It won't last long!

152
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,715
Everyone, please, help me out!

153
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:54,344
I met Shin to protect this world!

154
00:09:57,758 --> 00:09:58,772
This is...

155
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,772
Wow!

156
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,357
Isn't this...

157
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:11,111
However, the opponent is also a Spirit.

158
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:15,406
We will have to combine
our strengths to defeat him.

159
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,409
Combine our strengths?

160
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,203
Is that even possible?

161
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,997
He's here with us.

162
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,876
The one who can handle the power
of all the Angels alone.

163
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,256
Let's go, everyone!

164
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,216
We will save the world!

165
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:38,847
You think we will let you?!

166
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:39,955
We won't let you go!

167
00:10:53,605 --> 00:10:54,613
Belial!

168
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,322
Gabriel!

169
00:11:00,417 --> 00:11:02,620
I will also use this power!

170
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,165
Zafkiel, Aleph!

171
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,879
Halvanhelev!

172
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:18,928
Michael,

173
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,513
Shifuru!

174
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,185
Camael!

175
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,157
Well, that's a good move. Then...

176
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,159
how about this?

177
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,368
Athiel!

178
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,165
Is that...

179
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,299
It's okay!

180
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,178
Now that I'm back,
you can rest easy!

181
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,515
You did a great job, Nia.

182
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:08,811
I'm going to upgrade your usefulness
level from paramecium to daphnia.

183
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,689
That voice...
Is that you, Maria?!

184
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:17,695
Yes. I am the perfect Maria
who just got her long-awaited real body.

185
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,784
Nibelcole is a pseudo-spirit
created by Beelzebub.

186
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:27,080
Then there is no reason why
we can't do the same with Rasiel!

187
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,334
Of course, individuals exposed to
Athiel's power cannot be revived.

188
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,710
With this body,

189
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,339
it is possible to protect everyone,
even if only for a short while!

190
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,383
Go, Maria!

191
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:40,677
I choose you!

192
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,720
Maria won't listen to you.

193
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,846
Ouch!

194
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:48,226
Now, leave the defense
to me and go, Shido.

195
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,979
And then, settle this.

196
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:52,188
Yeah!

197
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,485
Metatron!

198
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,487
Rasiel!

199
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,865
Zafkiel!

200
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,493
Zadkiel!

201
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:07,829
Camael!

202
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:10,972
Michael!

203
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,043
Haniel!

204
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,878
Raphael!

205
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,006
Gabriel!

206
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,341
Sandalphon!

207
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,032
Go, Shido!

208
00:13:26,033 --> 00:13:26,973
Yes!

209
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,017
Shido Itsuka!

210
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,417
Well done,

211
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,420
Shido Itsuka.

212
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,133
Yet, I guess you fell one step short.

213
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,051
What?!

214
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,762
Qemetiel!

215
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,894
Shido!

216
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:13,811
Shido!!!

217
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,319
No, Shido.

218
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,697
Mio?

219
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,950
You have those waiting for you.

220
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,536
The spiritual power is out of control.

221
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:34,707
If we let that thing be,
the whole world will be wiped out.

222
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:39,629
But if I use my Ain
to cause an annihilation,

223
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,423
I might be able to contain it.

224
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,591
Wha...

225
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,094
If you do that, you're gonna...

226
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,139
Shinji even said it!

227
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,975
He wants to show
the world more to you, Mio!

228
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,186
But, why?!

229
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,608
Shido, you are really nice.

230
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,985
I love you so much.

231
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:07,615
However... after Shin,

232
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:09,397
okay?

233
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:18,501
Mio!!!

234
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,641
Deus, huh?

235
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,353
It's a luxury to have you
as my bridesmaid.

236
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,942
Surely, we shouldn't be
in this world from now on.

237
00:15:44,587 --> 00:15:45,645
Neither you...

238
00:15:46,974 --> 00:15:48,005
or me...

239
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:55,246
I wonder why I couldn't get you.

240
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,832
In the first place,

241
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,834
you should never have
created a spirit.

242
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:04,380
This kind of power is
too much for humans.

243
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:09,385
It's just that, well,

244
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:13,848
if there's something else
to your misfortune...

245
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,643
You were never my type.

246
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,029
I see. Well, then,
I guess I can't blame you.

247
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,536
Qemetiel.

248
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:37,705
Ain.

249
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,226
<i>This is for the best...</i>

250
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,604
<i>I realized it too late...</i>

251
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:03,495
<i>But...</i>

252
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,902
<i>just being able to protect Shido
and everyone else in the end...</i>

253
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,530
I'm sorry,

254
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,585
everyone...

255
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,493
Mio.

256
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,457
I'm sorry, Mio.

257
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,752
I've kept you waiting for a long time.

258
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,129
Shin...

259
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,382
Shin! Shin!

260
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:30,590
Mio!

261
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,135
I've missed you for a long, long time.

262
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,138
I've missed you, too, for a long time!

263
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,129
From now on,
we'll always be together.

264
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:40,393
Yeah!

265
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,360
Ike!

266
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,535
Hey, Ellen.

267
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,454
Ike, what on earth...

268
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,291
I'll get you to
a Medical Realizer right away...

269
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,625
It's futile.

270
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:10,673
I caught up in the annihilation of Angel
and Demon King at point-blank range.

271
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,427
It's a wonder I'm still conscious.

272
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,762
Ike...

273
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:21,609
Ah, Elliot...

274
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:23,811
And Karen.

275
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,316
I beg you, Elliot. Save Ike!

276
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,817
You could do it, right?!

277
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,629
Elliot...

278
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,572
If only I could.

279
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,616
However, he is...

280
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:45,041
Why did you bother to come here?

281
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:48,085
Are you here to laugh at me?

282
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:53,966
Is it so strange to want to see
a friend on his deathbed?

283
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:58,594
Yeah, it was a dumb question...

284
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,891
We may have taken different paths,

285
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:04,477
but you and Karen are my friends...

286
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,228
Besides...

287
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,107
We were both dumped by the same woman.

288
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:13,986
I can't say you're wrong.

289
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,624
<i>What?</i>

290
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:31,462
<i>I didn't realize how easy it was...</i>

291
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,890
Shido. Shido!

292
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,192
Shido!

293
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:57,363
Mhm... You're awake now.
We were worried about you.

294
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:00,116
Relief. Kaguya was so worried that

295
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,785
she was crying and
hanging on to Shido.

296
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,787
I didn't go that far!

297
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,914
Tohka... how's Mio?

298
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,384
I... see...

299
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,472
Aw, I've been dumped.

300
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,391
She prefers Shin rather than me.

301
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,643
Is that so?

302
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,562
Then, we can't do anything about that.

303
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,400
I guess even Shido couldn't stand up
to the true love couple.

304
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,447
Huh?

305
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,366
You've...

306
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,203
You've met Shin, huh,

307
00:21:28,433 --> 00:21:29,466
Mio?

308
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:46,946
Shido!

309
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,228
Sorry I'm late, Shido.

310
00:21:53,248 --> 00:21:54,788
I just got here, too.

311
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:59,944
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

312
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:05,825
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

313
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:11,247
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

314
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:16,627
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

315
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:23,133
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

316
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:31,016
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

317
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:37,189
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

318
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:43,362
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

319
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:48,826
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

320
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:52,705
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

321
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:57,459
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

322
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:04,008
<i>in our hands alight</i>

323
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,521
Now, Shido...

324
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:19,560
Let's start our date!
