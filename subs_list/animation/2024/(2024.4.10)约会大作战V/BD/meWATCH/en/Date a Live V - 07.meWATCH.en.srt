1
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,192
All ships, fall back!

2
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:29,862
Keep your distance to avoid being hit
by the light and press on the attack!

3
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:32,532
Maria, where are Shido and Tohka?

4
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,950
<i>I do not know yet.</i>

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,245
<i>The footage is distorted
because of that object.</i>

6
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:42,416
<i>Moreover, another angel-like object
appeared on the ground.</i>

7
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:44,168
<i>Please hasten the analysis.</i>

8
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:48,798
Now that Reinyan is gone,
I guess I'm the only one available...

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,384
I'll try to do something
with spirit power!

10
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:53,719
Shido...

11
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,477
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

12
00:01:43,477 --> 00:01:49,191
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

13
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:54,655
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

14
00:01:54,655 --> 00:02:00,161
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

15
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:06,459
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

16
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:14,550
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

17
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:20,640
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

18
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,812
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

19
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:32,109
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

20
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:36,113
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

21
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:40,660
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

22
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:47,541
<i>in our hands alight</i>

23
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,142
Captain...

24
00:03:05,142 --> 00:03:06,143
We're almost there!

25
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:09,647
Anyway, if we can get to that ship
called Fraxinus or whatever that is...

26
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,151
Huh?

27
00:03:14,151 --> 00:03:16,028
This is...

28
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:18,072
You are First Lieutenant Kusakabe, right?

29
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:20,449
I have heard the story from Tobiichi.

30
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:22,159
W-Who are you?

31
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,746
I am Hinako Shiizaki,
a member of the Fraxinus crew.

32
00:03:25,746 --> 00:03:29,917
We have moved you all aboard
the ship with the transporter.

33
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:30,543
Now,

34
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,337
please bring Artemisia
and her squad over here.

35
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:35,423
O-Okay...

36
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,925
They are my dear friends.
Please take care of them.

37
00:03:37,925 --> 00:03:41,178
We can't guarantee that,
but we'll do our best.

38
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,358
Welcome to Fraxinus.

39
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:57,069
I'm Kotori Itsuka, the commander.

40
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:01,657
I am Ryoko Kusakabe,
a former AST member of the JGSDF.

41
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:02,825
Wait...

42
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:05,077
Y-You are the commander?

43
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:08,831
Oh, what a nostalgic response!

44
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:13,461
We've grown accustomed to it,
but it's just not normal, you know?

45
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,338
That a middle school girl
is the commander.

46
00:04:16,338 --> 00:04:17,715
Ahem.

47
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:19,592
Excuse me.

48
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,011
Please forgive my foolishness for trying

49
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,222
to judge your ability based on age and
appearance, even if only for a moment.

50
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,100
I appreciate you being flexible.

51
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:31,145
But I'm sorry to disappoint you,

52
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,856
I don't think we can afford
to have a welcome party.

53
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:37,818
Please don't worry about it.
We understand the situation.

54
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:41,822
Thanks.
Artemisia's recovery is completed.

55
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:42,865
Kannazuki,

56
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,784
our preparation's ready, right?

57
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,951
We're going through.

58
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,621
Yeah, I'm on it, Commander.

59
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,371
Wha...

60
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,081
What?!

61
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:58,672
Captain Kannazuki!
What are you doing here?!

62
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,634
Ah, long time no see, Kusakabe.

63
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,886
Captain...

64
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,763
...Kannazuki?

65
00:05:05,971 --> 00:05:07,139
Huh?

66
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,352
He was the captain of the AST
when I was just assigned to it!

67
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:15,147
He was the top ace of the troop,
by far and away the best.

68
00:05:15,147 --> 00:05:17,650
Wow, so he is...

69
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,276
Isn't he kind of cool?

70
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:23,030
Kannazuki, you used to do that, huh?

71
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,785
I thought the commander had picked
you up from the side of the road...

72
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,538
Commander Itsuka,
this man is dangerous!

73
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:35,000
He is a pervert who dreams of getting his
ass kicked by a middle school-aged girl!

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,829
During his tenure,

75
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,484
he started the "Association to Protect
Junior High School Girls" by himself,

76
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:41,048
and was reported as a
suspicious person while watching over

77
00:05:41,048 --> 00:05:44,051
local middle school students
on their commute to school!

78
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,554
Commander, you are in his strike zone!

79
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,013
That's rude!

80
00:05:48,013 --> 00:05:50,516
Lately, I like to get stomped
by the heels as well!

81
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,768
The modest but smoldering goodness of...

82
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,728
Y-Yahoo!

83
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,274
We don't have time for this!

84
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,318
Maria breaks through
the front DEM fleet.

85
00:06:01,318 --> 00:06:03,320
We'll launch an attack on Mio.

86
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,282
<i>Copy that.
Authorizing activation of Gungnir.</i>

87
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,534
Why are you sleeping so carefree?

88
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,288
Ratatoskr is not paying you
to take a nap, you know?

89
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:12,872
Ah!

90
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,290
Thank you so much.

91
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,959
Here we go, Maria!

92
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,627
For the spirits!

93
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:22,923
And above all, for the reward
from the Commander!

94
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,467
Captain...

95
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,388
Was that guy really our top ace?

96
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,195
He really was.

97
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:31,807
But...

98
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:34,268
To have taken the
"walking problem generator,"

99
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,479
"The man whose technique is a treasure
but his fetish should be reported,"

100
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:40,524
Kyohei Kannazuki, this far...

101
00:06:41,108 --> 00:06:45,070
That commander's no ordinary woman...!

102
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,449
<i>Launching Yggdrafolium,
first to fifteenth.</i>

103
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,576
<i>It will deflect
the enemy ship in front of us.</i>

104
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,579
<i>After passing through it,
provide support for the spirits.</i>

105
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,389
Analysis complete!

106
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:14,266
What on earth is this!

107
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,893
What's wrong, Nia?

108
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,854
What's wrong with that Angel?

109
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:21,023
It's way beyond the level of overkill!

110
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:24,151
Every living thing exposed to that
light is dead without exception,

111
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:26,028
and all objects are destroyed.

112
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:32,952
The lifespan, durability limits, and so on
of anything is instantly reduced to zero...

113
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:36,330
In a word, it's like
"absolute death beam"?

114
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,708
If I drew something like this in a comic
it would definitely be rejected.

115
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,336
I mean, how are you going to beat it?

116
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,798
As for the other thing,
it's kind of...

117
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,717
That one area is like
a completely different world.

118
00:07:48,717 --> 00:07:53,263
If we could get a little closer, we might
be able to see what's going on inside...

119
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:55,034
<i>Kotori.</i>

120
00:07:55,474 --> 00:07:57,726
<i>Jettison the compartment
where the unconscious</i>

121
00:07:57,726 --> 00:08:00,479
<i>and non-combatants
who were boarded earlier,</i>

122
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,482
<i>I suggest we jettison it to Ulmus.</i>

123
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,109
Maria...

124
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,528
<i>Of course, I have no intention of losing.</i>

125
00:08:08,028 --> 00:08:09,905
<i>It's just a risk diversification.</i>

126
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:12,741
Thank you, Maria.

127
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:15,119
Thanks for your suggestion.

128
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:19,540
<i>No. It's a given that AI's processing
speed is faster than human's.</i>

129
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:24,878
Captain Kusakabe, it's as you heard.

130
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:28,590
Would you mind guarding the section
where we're going to launch?

131
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,550
Do you mean...

132
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,720
Alright, Roger that.

133
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,887
Godspeed.

134
00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:37,224
Captain, you are a wonderful person.

135
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:39,393
I'd love to have you under my command.

136
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:48,277
Now, I'm sorry, everyone.
But you're going to join me to the hell.

137
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:52,906
If anyone wants to retreat,
feel free to join them now.

138
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:55,534
What are you saying, Commander?

139
00:08:55,534 --> 00:08:58,912
We've come this far, we're willing
to go all the way with you.

140
00:08:58,912 --> 00:09:03,167
In the first place, it's too dangerous to
leave you and vice commander alone.

141
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,918
Absolutely.

142
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,546
Alright, then.

143
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,591
Let's go. I love you, everyone.

144
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,467
Right!

145
00:09:16,972 --> 00:09:19,808
<i>We forced our way through
the enemy fleet territory.</i>

146
00:09:19,808 --> 00:09:22,227
<i>Kotori, get the main gun ready.</i>

147
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,402
We have confirmed the inside
of the space in question!

148
00:09:30,402 --> 00:09:34,364
In the center of it is Analyst Murasame...
no, it's Mio Takamiya!

149
00:09:34,364 --> 00:09:37,117
Tohka and Tobiichi
are fighting against her!

150
00:09:37,117 --> 00:09:38,660
What about everyone else?

151
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:44,166
Around them... Yoshino, Kaguya,
Yuzuru, Mukuro are collapsed!

152
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:47,920
There are no vital signs!

153
00:09:54,593 --> 00:09:56,678
Our target, Mio Takamiya...

154
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:00,516
Gungnir...

155
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,767
Fire!

156
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:08,690
What's wrong?
You're not going to come?

157
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,194
If you won't come,
then I'll come to you.

158
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,492
Origami!

159
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,409
I know!

160
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:22,204
Sandalphon!

161
00:10:32,422 --> 00:10:34,216
Einherjar!

162
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,774
Reine...

163
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:36,361
Or... should I call you Mio now?

164
00:11:37,237 --> 00:11:39,573
I'm fine with both.

165
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,912
Reine... was it all a lie?

166
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:47,497
You who helped me...

167
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:50,542
and kept supporting me...

168
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:53,212
even when you called me
your best friend!

169
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:56,089
Was it all a lie, all of it?

170
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,633
It's not a lie.

171
00:11:58,258 --> 00:12:04,097
I cared for the spirits
and I liked everyone in Fraxinus.

172
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:08,560
And I still consider you
to be my best friend, even now.

173
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,854
It's just...

174
00:12:10,854 --> 00:12:15,609
I would even devour
my best friend to get Shin back.

175
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,485
That's all.

176
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,961
There's... no way...

177
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:37,422
What does... that mean...

178
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,886
Raphael!

179
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,060
Nibelcole.

180
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,400
Leave it to us, Father!

181
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,695
It's no use!

182
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:05,492
What?!

183
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:10,372
How is it? It's simple,
but it's not a bad move, right?

184
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:15,294
You've been doing
whatever you want all this time.

185
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,629
You're going to take responsibility!

186
00:13:20,757 --> 00:13:22,259
Metatron!

187
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,145
Huh, what? Did you just get
obliterated by your own attack?

188
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,231
Do you think you're no match for us
so you blow yourself up?

189
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:39,526
So, what should we do, Father?

190
00:13:39,526 --> 00:13:41,862
Hmm... Well...

191
00:13:45,615 --> 00:13:46,491
Huh?!

192
00:13:48,493 --> 00:13:52,914
What?! What's wrong with me
that I dare to attack Father?!

193
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:55,125
Is it rebellion?
Am I being rebellious?

194
00:13:58,628 --> 00:14:00,005
Wha... You!

195
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,758
I can't believe you attacked
Father dressed as me!

196
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:06,845
Were you transformed into Nibelcole
with the power of Haniel?

197
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:12,142
It was a smart move,
but also very predictable.

198
00:14:13,518 --> 00:14:19,399
My Demon King is Beelzebub, which is
able to know everything in the world.

199
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:25,280
Of course, I've already researched
what kind of power each spirit has.

200
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,746
It's time to close the curtain.

201
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:39,878
I have to get the remaining
Spiritual Power before I encounter Deus...

202
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:43,423
In order to create a new world.

203
00:14:44,424 --> 00:14:47,177
A new... world?

204
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:52,182
Yes. I, Elliot, Ellen, and Karen...

205
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:54,976
are not artificial magicians.

206
00:14:54,976 --> 00:14:59,689
We are descendants of
a pure sorcerer called Magus.

207
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,735
One day, humans who feared our power

208
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:07,823
burned down our village
and killed all of our people.

209
00:15:09,324 --> 00:15:14,579
So I will override this world
with the power of Deus.

210
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,999
To exact revenge on mankind...

211
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:24,089
Would it be easier to convince you
if that is the reason?

212
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,465
What did you say?

213
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,345
To tell you the truth,
it's not that big of a reason.

214
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,850
In my case, my standards for feeling
"pleasure" and "discomfort"

215
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,018
were a little different from others.

216
00:15:37,018 --> 00:15:38,854
That's all there is to it.

217
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,983
The rest is no different than
any other human being.

218
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:48,613
I'm just striving to achieve my goals
and my curiosity as I wish.

219
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:55,370
In that regard,
I <i>am</i> a very ordinary person...

220
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,416
Well, this has gotten long-winded...

221
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,793
Farewell, Shido Itsuka.

222
00:16:02,335 --> 00:16:03,420
And to you, too,

223
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,133
Shinji Takamiya.

224
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,805
W-What?!

225
00:16:14,887 --> 00:16:16,099
Natsumi?!

226
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:24,691
Are you okay, Darling?

227
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,201
Dangerous.

228
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:27,569
That was a close one!

229
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,155
Thanks for saving me.

230
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:33,450
What is going on
with the battle right now?

231
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:36,203
We've been out of communication
with everyone...

232
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:39,706
I mean, isn't that the enemy general?

233
00:16:39,706 --> 00:16:41,666
I'll fill you in later!

234
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,835
The Spirit of Origin has appeared!

235
00:16:43,835 --> 00:16:47,589
We'll beat that guy as soon as possible
and assist everyone!

236
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,217
Wha... Spirit of Origin?

237
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,512
That's something we need to rush!

238
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:57,432
I will take it a step higher
for Darling and everyone else!

239
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:08,777
Oh? Diva and Witch, huh?

240
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,445
I'm happy to see that.

241
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:13,532
I can get two Sephiras
from the two of you.

242
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:17,410
What should we do, Darling?

243
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,916
Shido will take out Nibelcole
while we beat the master?

244
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:28,380
No. To beat him, we'll have to make
a move beyond his anticipation...

245
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,008
Otherwise, we must launch attacks
that are predictable but unavoidable.

246
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:35,929
Both of you can enhance me
with Gabriel's performance.

247
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,347
That's all I need.

248
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,431
Darling...

249
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,315
You must have some idea, huh?

250
00:17:41,316 --> 00:17:43,687
All right, take care!

251
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,904
Whatever you're doing, it's useless!

252
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:56,408
We'll put all three of you down and
make you kneel before our father!

253
00:17:56,783 --> 00:17:57,909
Sandalphon!

254
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,622
Halvanhelev!

255
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:24,670
Father!

256
00:18:31,234 --> 00:18:35,655
I possess omniscient power
and unlimited knowledge.

257
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:39,993
I think you still underestimated
the meaning of that.

258
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:52,589
Right!

259
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,634
If it's you,
I'm sure you'll block that attack.

260
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,096
Surely, if you've got Beelzebub,

261
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:03,391
Angel's power is the first thing
you'd look into, of course.

262
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:07,228
Since I'm the one who uses it
and not the original owner,

263
00:19:07,228 --> 00:19:08,855
it is less powerful.

264
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:10,899
But you see,

265
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,902
did you know this from Beelzebub?

266
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:15,820
Did you look into it?

267
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:19,282
Say, the omniscient Westcott!

268
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,034
What?

269
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:23,203
Roaring Flash...

270
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,330
...Blast Wave!

271
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:45,850
Darling!

272
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:46,851
Shido!

273
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,026
Looks like you've got me...

274
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,115
Is this the end of the line?

275
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,535
It's surprising how easy it went.

276
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,130
Geez... I was so surprised.

277
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,717
Yeah... frankly, I thought
you were going to kill him.

278
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,095
Yeah... I'd like to kill him.

279
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:27,016
In fact, I made the last attack
because I didn't care if he died.

280
00:20:27,016 --> 00:20:29,102
The last attack...

281
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:31,020
Roaring Flash or something like...

282
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,605
Ah, ahem!

283
00:20:33,773 --> 00:20:36,484
I don't know how to say it.

284
00:20:36,484 --> 00:20:40,572
It's just... I'm sure
it's not good to kill him.

285
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,699
I don't want to end up
like these guys...

286
00:20:43,616 --> 00:20:45,368
I feel bad for Shinji, though.

287
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:47,704
Darling...

288
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,249
Well, that's fine, too. I guess.

289
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,752
Are you sure?

290
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,755
I don't think you'll ever get
another opportunity like this...

291
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,258
Shut up! The loser doesn't get
a say in the matter!

292
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,513
You sound just like Elliot.

293
00:21:05,513 --> 00:21:07,474
That's too bad.

294
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:12,020
I've always been interested
in the sensation of death...

295
00:21:21,637 --> 00:21:22,530
Wha...

296
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,491
Huh?

297
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,162
Miku! Natsumi!

298
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,373
Shin...

299
00:21:35,418 --> 00:21:36,419
Mio!

300
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:40,423
Everyone is...

301
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:43,885
All of the Sephiras
have been collected...

302
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:46,929
Along with their lives.

303
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,227
Now we'll be together forever...

304
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,061
Shin.
