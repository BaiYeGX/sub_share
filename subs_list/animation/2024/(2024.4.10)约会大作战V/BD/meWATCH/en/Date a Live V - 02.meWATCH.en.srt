1
00:00:04,755 --> 00:00:07,758
Hmm...
This is kind of hard.

2
00:00:07,758 --> 00:00:09,259
Am I doing it right?

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,971
Yes, I think you're doing great!

4
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:15,766
Yours looks bigger
than mine, though, Tohka.

5
00:00:15,766 --> 00:00:17,559
Oh, you think so?

6
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:22,356
Are you making refreshments
for Shido and the others?

7
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,650
Yes, exactly!

8
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,859
Yup.

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,905
Right now, Shido and others are
preparing for the upcoming battle.

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:33,450
I believe the more you think,
the hungrier you'll be.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,369
Yoshino, Natsumi, would you
join us in making these, too?

12
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,828
It'll be fun!

13
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,996
Huh?!

14
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,375
Well, uhh,
I'm kinda bad at such things...

15
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:45,629
Let us do it. We want to
be a part of helping you, too.

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,133
Yoshinon's paw is on fire right now!

17
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:53,303
What? Are you saying that rabbits
are not supposed to have paws?

18
00:00:53,304 --> 00:00:57,766
You know what?
I hate perceptive brats like you.

19
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:02,396
Let's do it, Natsumi. I am sure
it will be fun if we do it together.

20
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,899
What?! Well, uhh...

21
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,403
That sounds like a "yes."
Come on, join us.

22
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:11,280
Come on. Let's do it!

23
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:30,465
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

24
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:36,179
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

25
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:41,643
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

26
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:47,149
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

27
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:53,447
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

28
00:01:53,447 --> 00:02:01,538
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

29
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:07,628
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

30
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:13,800
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,097
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

32
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:23,101
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

33
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,648
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

34
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:34,529
<i>in our hands alight</i>

35
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:48,251
All Times Riddle! Mention words
that are not erotic but sound erotic.

36
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,420
"Chinsukko."

37
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,422
Uhm, let's see...

38
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,049
"Full of load."

39
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,551
Answer. "Sax."

40
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,262
What?!
Umm...

41
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,683
Well, uhh...
"Machupichu"?

42
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:05,644
What? Would you mind
to explain that, Kaguya?

43
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,771
How could "Machupichu"
sound erotic?

44
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,163
I would like to hear
your explanation, too!

45
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:11,817
Please enlighten me.

46
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,319
Request.
I demand an explanation.

47
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,199
What is it about the ruins of the Inca
Empire that arouses your sexual arousal?

48
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,328
Hey, why do you
only tweak when it's my turn?

49
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,832
Uhm...

50
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,751
I mean it sounds like it, doesn't it?

51
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,305
Huh? What sound?

52
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:33,130
I don't get it!

53
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,091
Petition.
Please elaborate.

54
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,928
It's like a kiss...

55
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,346
After you pronounce it.

56
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:46,351
Ah, I see.
I get it now.

57
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,229
Oh, my! What a cutie, Kaguya!

58
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,482
Toleration.
Well, she seems to be serious about it,

59
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,192
so let's leave it as good.

60
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,820
What's with that awkward feel?!

61
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,615
Then explain to me!
What's so erotic about "Chinsukko"?!

62
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,491
What?

63
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,534
Obviously, it sounds
like "Wiene―"

64
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:05,036
Whoa, hold on!
Don't explain it, please!

65
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,832
What?! But you asked me
to explain it, didn't you?

66
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,125
Whatever.

67
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,378
All right, round two. "Cuniculus."

68
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,173
Uhm... "Bust," I guess.

69
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,633
Answer. "Six."

70
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,512
Chu... "Chupacabra."

71
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,432
How could you find that erotic?

72
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,100
Please tell us.

73
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,976
Confusion.

74
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,772
What is it about a South American
vampire that sexually arouses you?

75
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,816
Oh, my God! I had enough
of these members!

76
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,318
Um...

77
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,445
Well, let's do All Times Riddle again!

78
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,031
Tell me about our boy's coolest moments!

79
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:41,615
Huh?

80
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:45,368
For me, I think it was
the time he kissed me

81
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,913
and didn't give up
when I was dying.

82
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,457
And he hugged me so tight like this.

83
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,042
For me, it should be that one!

84
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,545
The moment when he took a stand
and protected me from the attack

85
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,465
of the inverted Tohka at
the DEM Japan headquarters!

86
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,968
Awww. It's so cool
just to remember it already!

87
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,471
Reflection.
For Yuzuru...

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,474
it was when he stopped
Yuzuru and Kaguya from fighting.

89
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,644
Hey, that's not fair!
That's what I was going to say!

90
00:05:12,896 --> 00:05:15,649
We don't want him,
our beloved boy, to die.

91
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,859
If my darling hadn't been there,

92
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:22,280
I still might not have been able
to trust people as much as I did.

93
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,950
Affirmation.
If Shido had not been there,

94
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,162
either Yuzuru or Kaguya would not
have existed in this world.

95
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:30,747
Well, me, too.

96
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,626
If it weren't for the boy,
I'd be dead for sure.

97
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,261
(Tohka - Dialing)

98
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,011
Tohka?
(Tohka - Dialing)

99
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,679
(In call)

100
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,722
<i>Hey, Kaguya.</i>

101
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:50,976
<i>I'm making rice balls for Shido
and the others right now,</i>

102
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,185
<i>would you like to join me?</i>

103
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,522
<i>Uhmm, it's me, Yoshino.</i>

104
00:05:55,522 --> 00:06:00,443
<i>Yuzuru, I'm making refreshments
for Shido and the others right now.</i>

105
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,904
<i>Hey, Nia.
It's Muku.</i>

106
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,322
<i>I want you to help me.</i>

107
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:06,324
(Natsumi)
(<i>"Help me with the refreshment"</i>)

108
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:11,997
Ah! Natsumi, why are you the only
one who is texting instead of calling?

109
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,041
Please let me hear your lovely voice!

110
00:06:17,736 --> 00:06:20,714
Shizaki, have you requested
support from each division?

111
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,965
Yes, I have.

112
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,968
I will report back as soon
as I receive a response.

113
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,596
MARIA, have you finished
the aircraft maintenance?

114
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:29,764
<i>No mechanical issues,</i>

115
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:34,352
<i>but if needed, the basic realizer could
be manually monitored by the wizard.</i>

116
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:38,607
<i>And I would like the exterior
to be cleaned and waxed.</i>

117
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,027
I'll accommodate the first
but reject the second.

118
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,738
I mean, it'll just get dirty
after two days anyway.

119
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,572
<i>Geez...</i>

120
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:49,242
<i>It is from the heart
that women wither, Kotori.</i>

121
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,619
Excuse me?!

122
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:52,454
Calm down, Kotori.

123
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:55,248
Why don't you get some rest?

124
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,250
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

125
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,543
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,379
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

127
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,635
What are you talking about? You're going
to have the toughest mission, Shido.

128
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:09,262
You can't afford to be helping people.

129
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,139
"The toughest mission?"

130
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,517
Survive, whatever it takes.

131
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,522
I see.
You're indeed right.

132
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,068
Both DEM and Kurumi
are after you, Shido.

133
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,695
And I'm also curious to see
how the phantom will work out.

134
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,699
Particularly, we don't know
what the phantom's identity is

135
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,577
or what her purpose is
for increasing the number of spirits.

136
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,205
To me, that just doesn't
seem eerie enough.

137
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,416
The Phantom's purpose, huh?

138
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:42,128
Well, maybe it's just
a surprisingly silly thought.

139
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,175
We brought refreshments for you all!

140
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,302
We made you rice balls.

141
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,305
Yes.
Feel free to eat.

142
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:52,847
(Kotori)

143
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,432
And this one is for Kotori.
(Kotori)

144
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:58,061
Oh... is there possibly
a difference in what's inside?

145
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,729
Let's dig in!

146
00:08:02,973 --> 00:08:04,943
Kotori?
What's wrong?

147
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:08,947
Coriander?

148
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,490
What, are you bullying me?!

149
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,034
You know that
I really hate coriander, right?!

150
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,120
In order to defeat DEM,

151
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,998
all of us are trying to
overcome our preferences

152
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,792
in order to become mentally
as strong as possible!

153
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:24,546
There's something in our rice balls
that we hate too, by the way!

154
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,259
In my rice ball,
it's dried plums.

155
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,888
Muku's rice ball has wasabi in it.

156
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,142
Mine has celery.

157
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,231
Here you go.

158
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,609
You must go through
the ordeal too, Shido!

159
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,360
What?!

160
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,279
Uhh...

161
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:49,904
(Shido)

162
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,782
What's inside this thing?
(Shido)

163
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,161
Hmm... Frankly, I had trouble
filling your rice balls.

164
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,789
I mean, you rarely have
a food you find unpleasant, Shido.

165
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,874
Affirmation.

166
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,877
We had to examine everything
right up to the last moment.

167
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:05,712
Darling.

168
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,673
I'll help you if you
have difficulty eating.

169
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,760
J-Just tell me what's inside
this thing already!

170
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:19,684
At least tell me what's inside!

171
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,069
Shido?

172
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,030
Tohka?
What's going on?

173
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,698
You can't sleep?

174
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,286
You see, Miku's sleeping
posture was horrendous...

175
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,289
She would crawl across
the floor like a caterpillar

176
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,417
and try to crawl into people's beds.

177
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,380
Are you sure that's
only a sleeping posture?

178
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,591
Anyway, what about you, Shido?

179
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:52,967
Well...

180
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,929
I was thinking about
Kurumi for a minute.

181
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,223
Kurumi…

182
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,683
...will be rescued by me, for sure.

183
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,769
I wanted to seal her spirit power,

184
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,313
and make her pay
for her sins as best I could.

185
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,273
Or so I thought.

186
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:14,030
But is my idea of "rescue"
really "rescue" for Kurumi?

187
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,115
That, I have no idea.

188
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:18,743
Kurumi is trying so hard
to help her best friend.

189
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:23,206
Would it be a genuine rescue
if I made her give up on that?

190
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,711
You see, Kurumi
absolutely has to be rescued.

191
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,799
But what should I do
to make that happen?

192
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,593
Is there actually anything I can do?

193
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,806
Can I sit next to you?

194
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,766
Yeah, sure.

195
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,692
They did this on a TV program
called "With Your Mother".

196
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,195
Apparently,
it's a way to relax the mind.

197
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,784
Thanks, Tohka.

198
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,037
You're always helping me out.

199
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,708
That's not true.

200
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,836
I should have apologized to you, Shido.

201
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,174
The other day, when I was told that

202
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,468
if Kurumi hadn't been there,
you would have died,

203
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,472
I felt a tightening
in my chest, Shido.

204
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,642
And I thought...

205
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,106
If I hadn't met you then,

206
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,985
you wouldn't have had
to go through that suffering, Shido.

207
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:39,490
Even now, it wouldn't have
bothered my mind so much like this.

208
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:44,996
Tohka...

209
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,082
What are you talking about?

210
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:52,253
You know what? I'm really glad
I met you back then.

211
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,130
But...

212
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,883
Yes, I've been in danger,

213
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,343
but more than that,

214
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,639
I've got a lot from you
and all the spirits.

215
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,226
If I were to go back to before I met you

216
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,770
with all the memories I have now,

217
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,023
I wouldn't hesitate
to reach out to you, Tohka.

218
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,901
Shido...

219
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,299
Good morning, ladies!

220
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,176
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

221
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,719
Morning, Tanomachi.

222
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,596
I mean, it's a cloudy day, though.

223
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,599
Say, did you hear
anything from Itsuka?

224
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,560
Nope. I think he's still
recovering from his cold.

225
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,063
It's suspicious though, isn't it?

226
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,565
Tokisaki has been absent
for a long time, too.

227
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,858
That's so lame!

228
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,194
So did Tohka and Tobiichi, right?

229
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:02,699
No way, they've been seduced
by the Lewd Predator Itsuka!

230
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,451
Or maybe the four of them
are on a hot spring trip?!

231
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:06,786
That's so lame!

232
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,330
Oh, come on.

233
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,708
Why would Itsuka do such a thing?

234
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,834
You think that's impossible?

235
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,004
Well, there's some probability, but...

236
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,714
I'll tell you when I've got his tail.

237
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,091
We appreciate your cooperation.

238
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,428
Spacequake alarm?!

239
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,679
No way!
Again?!

240
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,972
That's so lame!

241
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,141
Come on, let's go to the school shelter!

242
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,225
Aye aye.

243
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,855
What's wrong, Tonomachi?

244
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:35,023
Uhm...

245
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,483
Didn't you see something up there?

246
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,359
What?
In the sky?

247
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,902
What did you see?

248
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:44,741
Hmm... something like a battleship?

249
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,326
Huh?

250
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,370
Tonomachi, I'm sorry
for your brain damage.

251
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,207
No, I think he's an "I can see something
you can't see" kind of guy.

252
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,500
That's so lame!

253
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,671
Can you at least gossip somewhere
else so that I can't hear you?

254
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,676
This is weird.

255
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,053
I'm pretty sure...

256
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,012
Tonomachi!

257
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:06,637
Oh...

258
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,889
We're leaving you!

259
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,267
Hey! Wait for me, girls!

260
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:14,479
DEM fleet has emerged!

261
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,023
It's a fleet of approximately 30 ships!

262
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:20,360
It's almost all of the ships
in the DEM's fleet.

263
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,279
Looks like the information was correct.

264
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,156
How's the town?

265
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,283
Civilian evacuation has been completed.

266
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,285
No one on the ground.

267
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:33,039
Very well. Now we can fight
without restraint.

268
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,542
<i>Captain of Fraxinus,
this is Kotori Itsuka.</i>

269
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,171
<i>First of all, I would like to
thank you all for your cooperation.</i>

270
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:44,175
<i>We've had a rude visitor in our town.</i>

271
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,511
<i>They're the worst kind of
domestic violence bastards</i>

272
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:50,932
<i>who try to take away the power of
the spirits in a crude and coarse way!</i>

273
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:55,019
Oh my... Disgusting.
I bloody hate to see them.

274
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,020
<i>These are</i>

275
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,232
<i>the kind of men who want
to dominate women by force,</i>

276
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,276
<i>but when they get dumped,
they come on to them like complete losers.</i>

277
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:06,781
All right! Let's teach these rowdy bastards
who have no sense of respect a lesson.

278
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,492
Let's teach them
how to treat a woman right,

279
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,203
how to escort a woman gracefully,

280
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,789
and how we date!

281
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,040
- Roger that!
- Roger that!

282
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:19,669
That's a lot of enthusiasm.

283
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,672
Yeah, Kotori was cool, too!

284
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:27,427
After all, it's the commander's job to
raise everyone's morale for the battle.

285
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,761
Nevertheless,

286
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,348
we have only six ships to fight
against the enemy's 30 ships.

287
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,768
In addition, there are thousands
of Bandersnatch over there.

288
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:40,440
Also about Nibelcole,
her frequency of appearance is unclear.

289
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,065
But,

290
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,319
the ones who can break through
this situation are you, the spirits.

291
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,281
I know it's a dreadful thing
for the commander

292
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,326
of an organization that protects
spirits to beg them for help.

293
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:56,038
But please.
I need your help.

294
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,207
As the commander of the Ratatoskr...

295
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,083
No...

296
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,586
As Shido's little sister, I beg you.

297
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,838
Please save my beloved brother.

298
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:05,590
Of course!

299
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,885
Please let us help you.

300
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:14,223
Yes, that's right!
We'd be rather angry if you left us out!

301
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,602
You said it's the commander's job
to raise morale for the battle?

302
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,354
Well, my dear little sister...

303
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,482
You're very much a commander now!

304
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,444
Yup! The only commander
who can lead us is Kotori!

305
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:30,865
Affirmation. We can entrust the lives
of Yuzuru and the others to Kotori.

306
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,954
Thanks y'all...

307
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,835
Nia. It's safe to have a strategy
meeting here now, right?

308
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,465
Yeah. I have jammed on Beelzebub.

309
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,968
If they try to sneak over here now,
they won't make it in time.

310
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,847
So, what kind of evil tricks
are you going to do?

311
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,976
Suggestion. How about connecting
the space with Muku's Michael

312
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,355
and suddenly getting into
the very core of the enemy?

313
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,149
Ah, I knew you were thinking
the same thing!

314
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,485
I didn't tell you
because I couldn't say it.

315
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,531
I'm sorry,
but I think that's impossible.

316
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,116
Since Mister sealed my spiritual powers,

317
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,619
it's been difficult
to travel long distances.

318
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,205
Even if it were possible,
I wouldn't allow it.

319
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,582
They're obviously cautious, too.

320
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,585
You never know what kind
of traps they're setting.

321
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,338
The Bandersnatch is operated

322
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,799
by DEM's new Realizer,

323
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:31,300
the Ashcroft Beta.

324
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,888
It is modeled on
Artemisia Ashcroft's brain.

325
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,390
What?!

326
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,600
Is this Artemisia...

327
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,270
the wizard who was with Ellen?

328
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,856
She's formerly an ace in the
British Anti-Spirit Corps.

329
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:49,277
The DEM has managed to build

330
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:53,906
a control function into
the Realizer by tracing her brain.

331
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,241
MARIA.

332
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,203
If you could capture her,
would it be possible

333
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,665
to use that brainwave data to create
a jamming code to the Ashcroft Beta?

334
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,418
<i>Yes. Presumably, it is possible.</i>

335
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,380
She was originally skeptical
of the DEM's approach.

336
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,428
And yet, now she's obeying the DEM because
she's being memory-processed, I think.

337
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:21,058
If we can exploit that,
capturing Artemisia seems feasible.

338
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:24,061
I see.
All right, then.

339
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,315
MARIA, you seemed
to have a plan, too, right?

340
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:31,360
<i>Yes. There are ways
to neutralize Nibelcole.</i>

341
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,073
<i>But for that to happen,
we need Shido to be on the front line.</i>

342
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,283
Shido has to?

343
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,869
But you know that I can't allow that!

344
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,705
You see, this is a fight
to protect Shido!

345
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:47,084
<i>Yes, I know, but until
we do something about Nibelcole,</i>

346
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,711
<i>there will be no victory for us.</i>

347
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,297
I know that, but...

348
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,967
No, let's do it.
Tell me your plan, MARIA.

349
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:56,761
Shido...

350
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,351
Okay, I get it.
But before that, let us tell them first.

351
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:06,562
What it's like to fight us in this city.

352
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,898
We'll show them no mercy!

353
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:21,619
Apparently, Nightmare has got
my message across.

354
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:25,790
It seems that Ratatoskr has gone all out.

355
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,458
Good call.

356
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,253
If they don't attack here,
they won't stand a chance.

357
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,297
They're probably

358
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,676
going to take my head or yours.

359
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:43,140
They are well aware that
the DEM will be destroyed if we are gone.

360
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,187
If so, Ike, I think we should
still have stayed in a safe place.

361
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,149
This is the revolution we started.

362
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,442
That means,

363
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:57,154
I can't let you stand here alone.

364
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,910
Well, then, let's get started, Captain.

365
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,786
Yes, sir!

366
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:08,040
All ships, launch and deploy
the first fleet of Bandersnatch.

367
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,177
Prepare to fire the magic cannon!

368
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,930
Our target is the Ratatoskr airship!

369
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,809
Is the Ratatoskr ship
already attacking us?!

370
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:28,811
No, sir! This is...

371
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,369
Attention please!

372
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:50,291
Can you hear me?
Mr. Wicked Wizard.

373
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,917
It's Nightmare!

374
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:57,089
From now on,
I am coming to hunt you.

375
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,800
Please don't run away from me.

376
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,509
What the―

377
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,514
Second ship Honorius!
Third ship Notria!

378
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,391
Cover the Bandersnatch unit!

379
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,189
What is this?!
What the hell happened?!

380
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,316
We appear to have
been shelled from the ground!

381
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,777
From the ground?!

382
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,296
What the hell is this city?!

383
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,089
I'll take it from here.

384
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,010
We must calm down

385
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,973
and swing our fists with all our might.

387
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:12,957
<i>It's all gone by so naturally</i>

388
00:22:12,957 --> 00:22:19,296
<i>Seeking out the simple happiness</i>

389
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:24,927
<i>The dry wind that asks</i>

390
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:30,099
<i>A flower fluttering in the air</i>

391
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:37,314
<i>One day, I'll keep it a secret</i>

392
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:43,028
<i>Those faint and vivid shadows</i>

393
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,906
<i>I'm still here and breathing</i>

394
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,451
<i>With the pain that never ceases</i>

395
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,496
<i>I'm still here</i>

396
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:58,377
<i>Waiting for you</i>

397
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,472
<i>We shall live in this world</i>

398
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:17,021

that Shido uses against Nibelcole?</i>
