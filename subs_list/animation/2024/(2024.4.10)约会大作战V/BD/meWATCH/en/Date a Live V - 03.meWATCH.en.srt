1
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:12,137
Fourth and Fifth Streets,
keep up the barrage!

2
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,156
Roger that!

3
00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:18,936
The supermarket that's firing the beam
right now is the one I went there often...

4
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:23,524
In fact, Ratatoskr facilities were not
only installed in the underground.

5
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,152
Ships, initiate attack
on the enemy fleet!

6
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,404
Wizard units, assist the spirits!

7
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,531
<i>Affirmative.</i>

8
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:36,787
Gabriel!

9
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,831
Haniel, Kaleidoscope.

10
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,297
Ooh. So this is Gabriel, huh?

11
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:50,551
I certainly feel stronger.

12
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,470
Yeah! Now all we have to do
is beat them up!

13
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:12,447
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

14
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:18,245
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

15
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:23,709
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

16
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:29,214
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

17
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:35,512
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

18
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:43,604
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

19
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:49,693
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

20
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:55,866
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

21
00:01:55,866 --> 00:02:01,163
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

22
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:05,167
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

23
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:09,713
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

24
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:16,511
<i>in our hands alight</i>

25
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,942
I'll finish you all.

26
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,527
I'll finish you all!

27
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:37,699
How dare you try to stop me
with this kind of force?

28
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,535
I surely have been underestimated!

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,379
Hmph. And here you are,
mass production.

30
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,133
Mass production?
You're the one to talk.

31
00:02:55,133 --> 00:03:00,514
I've been wondering, don't you think
our traits are overlapping?

32
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:05,852
I'll take that as a challenge.
I will lay that head of yours

33
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,271
in front of your beloved "Father".

34
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,202
What is this?

35
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:27,332
Captain, this is what Origami
was talking about, right?

36
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,292
It seems so.

37
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,797
This is no longer
a battle against spirits.

38
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,301
<i>Hello, Captain of the AST from JGSDF.</i>

39
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:43,557
<i>This is Irene Fox,
2nd Executive Officer of DEM.</i>

40
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,683
DEM?

41
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:46,203
<i>I'll get to it,</i>

42
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:50,147
<i>just follow my instructions
and attack those spirits.</i>

43
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,481
<i>I'll provide cover for you.</i>

44
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,234
Huh? Hey, why are you giving me
an order all of a sudden?

45
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,444
<i>You girls...</i>

46
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,613
<i>...can be of at least
some help, right? Bye.</i>

47
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,787
Captain... are we
following DEM's orders?

48
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,085
If there's a spirit in front of us,
it is our job to defeat it,

49
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,463
it has nothing to do
with DEM's orders.

50
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,339
Let's move!

51
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,516
Pay attention to that cold air!
It can freeze your entire territory!

52
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,517
Roger that!

53
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,568
Michael, Lataib.

54
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,543
Hmm...

55
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,544
Are you those "AST" that
Origami told us about?

56
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,882
Y-You... are a spirit, right?

57
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,259
Did you just save us?

58
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,765
They intend to use you as bait,
don't let them trick you.

59
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,189
I've heard what happened
from Origami. Please, stay away.

60
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,692
C-Captain... are you hurt?

61
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,445
I'm fine... all thanks to that kid.

62
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,701
Everyone... get ready
to get a new job!

63
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,670
Artemisia.

64
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,879
Long time no see.

65
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:41,633
I can call you Origami Tobiichi, right?

66
00:05:42,903 --> 00:05:45,262
Your presence
in my sight is bugging me.

67
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,808
Do we, by any chance,
have met before?

68
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:53,687
You are undergoing
memory processing by DEM.

69
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,437
Huh?

70
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:59,192
We can cure you.

71
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,402
Does that mean...

72
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:04,409
Mr. Westcott is fooling me?

73
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:06,008
Right.

74
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,537
I'm sorry.
I can't believe it,

75
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,748
because you all are spirits!

76
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:24,050
Oops, we're not dealing with you all!

77
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:26,469
Yoshinon!

78
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,140
Okay!
Bad kids will be frozen!

79
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,414
Metatron!

80
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,743
I'm impressed.

81
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:53,747
<i>Oririn! This is a little tricky,</i>

82
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,874
<i>but Ellen is headed your way!</i>

83
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,632
You've come, Ellen...

84
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,759
Good call.

85
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,510
I see you've grown up.

86
00:07:09,272 --> 00:07:10,149
Karen,

87
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,698
I'll leave the rest to you.

88
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:26,203
Elliot,

89
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,826
may I share a joke to lighten the mood?

90
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:33,912
Oh?

91
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,499
Let's run away, Elliot.

92
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,045
Leave Ratatoskr,
the spirit, everything.

93
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:48,802
Then live together somewhere else.

94
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,805
I would like to have
at least three children.

95
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:52,806
Karen.

96
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,310
It's the best joke I've ever made.

97
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,940
Ahaha, you have
a talent for a comedienne.

98
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,792
Origami Tobiichi and Mana Takamiya?

99
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,963
Perfect. Let's take care
of them all together.

100
00:08:28,322 --> 00:08:29,426
Who are you?!

101
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,434
Yo, it's been a while, Ellen.

102
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:42,313
Did you enjoy pretending to be
the strongest in a world without me?

103
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,692
Elliot!

104
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,240
Ah, boring.

105
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,495
Right? We were sent to do
a boring job like attacking turrets.

106
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,205
Oh, look at that.

107
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,209
It's going to be interesting.

108
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,921
Beelzebub, Yeled.

109
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,599
Kahaha, so fragile!

110
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,809
I want to play some more,

111
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,104
but Father will scold me
if I take too long.

112
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,481
And now...

113
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,608
it's over!

114
00:09:34,823 --> 00:09:37,160
You can leave this to us!

115
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,496
Retreat.
Please stay back.

116
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,247
S-Sorry...

117
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,626
Ahaha, is this for real?

118
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:49,089
Princesses and Berserk!
We've got all the warriors!

119
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,510
You think you can defeat us
if you have the numbers?

120
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:57,597
I am one for all and all for one.

121
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:01,559
It doesn't matter how many you kill,
as long as I have Beelzebub, I'll never die.

122
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,104
How do you kill a woman who can't die?

123
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,189
Sorry, Nibelcole,

124
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,817
but we are not the ones
you are dealing with.

125
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:12,946
Khaha! You have a more
deserving opponent!

126
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,741
Agreed.
We are just the backup.

127
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,034
Huh?

128
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,417
Huh?

129
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,810
Shido... Itsuka?

130
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,438
Wow, that's pretty bold.

131
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,858
You're my opponent?

132
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:52,360
Ahaha, are you serious?

133
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,447
If I kill you,
Father will win this war...

134
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:00,702
Are you stupid? Now I got
a nice souvenir for Father!

135
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:16,092
I love you, Nibelcole.

136
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,099
Huh?!

137
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,614
Huuh? What was that again?

138
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,867
Nibelcole disappears! It worked!

139
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,912
<i>Nibelcole is no different
from other spirit.</i>

140
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:48,249
<i>Then it's a given that Shido's power
will be able to seal it...</i>

141
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,461
<i>The root of Nibelcole is Beelzebub,</i>

142
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:55,506
<i>but not all of its sephira
were taken from Nia!</i>

143
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,345
In other words, my influence
is reaching the Nibeko's.

144
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:06,809
Whether those girls can be sealed
or not, it's linked to my likability, huh?

145
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,146
<i>Yes, I know it sounds
condescending, but...</i>

146
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:15,652
<i>Even if they say they don't like it,
their bodies are honest.</i>

147
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:16,861
Raphael!

148
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,576
Now let's get started, Nibelcole,

149
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:26,537
it's time for our date!

150
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,748
Stop messing with me!

151
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,889
Then we just need
to stay away from him!

152
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,443
So, who's next?

153
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,362
Father!

154
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,657
I won't let you go, little kitty!

155
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,544
It's more powerful than I expected.

156
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,629
That's our Shido!

157
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,674
I wonder if this kind of thing
is also called "Peerless"...

158
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,220
Observe. It seems that we are
not going to be involved.

159
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:27,056
We will, they are coming!

160
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,725
We won't let you get in the way!

161
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,810
Shido, please take care of the rest.

162
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,147
Leave it to me!
Come on, come on!

163
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,192
Just give up.
There's no use in running away.

164
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,569
Shido! Behind you!

165
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,788
Well done.

166
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,373
You too.

167
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,834
But you can't win
if you keep running away.

168
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,962
What are you thinking, I wonder?

169
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:07,263
<i>Just in time. This is
the second Executive Officer of DEM,</i>

170
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,848
<i>Artemisia Ashcroft.</i>

171
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,976
<i>I'm fighting with a spirit.
I need a hand.</i>

172
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,562
I'm sorry, but we can't help you.

173
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:16,939
<i>After all, we are unemployed!</i>

174
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,285
A tie?

175
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,621
No, I think I win.

176
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:32,246
No.

177
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,250
It's our win.

178
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,587
Michael.

179
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,630
Lataib.

180
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,176
I hope I have been of help, Origami!

181
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:46,177
Thanks.

182
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,473
The result was a successful
two-step bait-and-switch...

183
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,768
I was actually going
to ask Mana to do it.

184
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:58,940
Sorry for the delay! It took me a while
to deal with the Bandersnatch!

185
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,233
I'm okay.

186
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,902
Captain made the right decision.

187
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,737
Don't mess around with me!

188
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,032
Oh gosh, I can't go back on this one.

189
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,744
Goodbye, my life as a public servant

190
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,665
This is your real body...

191
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,668
And not your alter ego, right?

192
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,338
Right, I am surprised you could tell.

193
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,881
Kurumi, I...

194
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:36,727
This is a battlefield.
You can not let your guard down.

195
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,062
Y-Yeah...

196
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,397
Thanks.

197
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,691
I owe you my life.

198
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,237
That's quite an exaggeration, isn't it?

199
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,655
It's not only about now.

200
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,784
Thank you so much for saving
my life over and over again...

201
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,871
I really wanted to tell you in person.

202
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:58,291
My, my, you're very welcome.

203
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:03,337
Then, in return, may I have
your spiritual power, Shido?

204
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,423
That's another story!

205
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,800
That's so unfortunate.

206
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,260
Well then,

207
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,804
I'll change my approach again!

208
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,980
Kurumi, I'm really grateful to you!

209
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,526
But I don't remember you telling me

210
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:28,029
to hide from DEM

211
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,490
and let you fight for me!

212
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:35,119
I'm not happy to be saved
in exchange for your life!

213
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:40,500
You underestimate me.
Please be quiet

214
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,210
and stay on the ship, Shido!

215
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,754
Then, after the battle is over,

216
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:47,089
you can offer your
spiritual power to me

217
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,551
with tears of gratitude!

218
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:55,973
That's just me being killed
by you instead of the DEM!

219
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:58,768
That's what I already told you!

220
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,271
I will return to the past with
Shido's spiritual power

221
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,024
and defeat the Spirit of Origin!

222
00:17:05,803 --> 00:17:08,611
When you realize it,
you'll be in a new world,

223
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,572
a happy and peaceful world!

224
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,574
It's not going to work out that easy!

225
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:18,287
I don't want to be questioned by someone
who actually succeeded in altering history!

226
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,040
Now that you mention it,
you're right, darn it!

227
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,750
If we change the past,

228
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,796
the existence of the spirits
and your death, Shido,

229
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,714
all of them will never
have happened!

230
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,967
What are you complaining about?

231
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,136
Then the fact that you and I ever met

232
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,806
would cease to exist!

233
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,392
I love you!

234
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:42,019
And you love me too, don't you?!

235
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:45,481
W-What are you saying?

236
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,149
Now remember,

237
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,236
I'm reliving your memories
with "Yud", you know!

238
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,906
I can see right through you!

239
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,451
Even if that were true...

240
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,956
I can't believe you said those words
while kissing another woman...

241
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,791
You're disgusting!

242
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,086
I'm really sorry about that...

243
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,577
Listen, Kurumi, when this battle is over,
I'm going back to the past!

244
00:18:13,578 --> 00:18:14,468
Huh?

245
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:18,431
I'll only redo what was wrong,
not everything!

246
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:23,728
Seal the power of the Spirits of Origin
and use their power to remake history!

247
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,480
I will undo all the misfortunes

248
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,485
that have fallen on your friends,
yourself, and the other spirits,

249
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,615
and then I will meet you
and everyone else once again!

250
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,700
I will create the most convenient,

251
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,329
and the most happy history!

252
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:42,246
What are you...

253
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,665
What are the odds of that...

254
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,626
You said it yourself.

255
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,172
I'm... the only person
in this world...

256
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,717
who has ever rewritten history!

257
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:03,017
Don't ignore me and
make your own world!

258
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,274
- Die!

259
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,651
- Kurumi, get away!
- Die!

260
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:24,121
Dalet!

261
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:37,927
My dear self!

262
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:44,809
I... hope...

263
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,144
I have been helpful to you.

264
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:53,943
Yes... it was worth it to keep you alive,
even if I didn't want to.

265
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,487
Hey, me...

266
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,248
Please, be... honest...

267
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,250
with yourself.

268
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,520
Kurumi...

269
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,651
She's sassy, rebellious, nosy...

270
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,572
She was a mess of
an alter ego, but...

271
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,618
she was finally useful before she died.

272
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:52,293
Shido, do you remember our match?

273
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,086
Our match?

274
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,464
Where we we won
if the other fell in love first?

275
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:03,179
We'll continue that after the battle...

276
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,141
After we get rid of the DEM...

277
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:12,521
I'm willing to give
my lips to you, Shido.

278
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,607
Are you serious, Kurumi?

279
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,694
Only if you beat the DEM, that is.

280
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:22,907
Can you do that, Shido?

281
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,284
It's a given!

282
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:29,663
If I can't do that, how can I
deal with the Spirit of Origin!

283
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,175
What?
