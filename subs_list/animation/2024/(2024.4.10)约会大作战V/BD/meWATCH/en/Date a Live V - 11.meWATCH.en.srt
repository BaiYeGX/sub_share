1
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,807
Kurumi Tokisaki!

2
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,768
What is the meaning of this?

3
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,232
Nightmare...

4
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,026
You've finally shown me an opening.

5
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,862
Isaac Westcott.

6
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:54,471
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

7
00:00:54,471 --> 00:01:00,227
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

8
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:05,691
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

9
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:11,196
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

10
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:17,494
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

11
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:25,586
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

12
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:31,675
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

13
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:37,848
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

14
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:43,145
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

15
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:47,149
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

16
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:51,695
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

17
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:58,535
<i>in our hands alight</i>

18
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,516
Ike!

19
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,187
Ike!

20
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,022
Ike!

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,402
Artemisia!
We're retreating!

22
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,278
<i>Roger!</i>

23
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,290
Kurumi...

24
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,459
Good day to you, Shido.

25
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,004
What's the matter?

26
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,632
Why are you making such a face?

27
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,842
What do you mean? Aren't you...

28
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,803
Are you all right?

29
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,597
Well, yeah, thanks to you.

30
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,435
The moment Mio took
the Sephira from me,

31
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:12,442
I transferred my memories and Sephira
to my alter ego generated by Het.

32
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:17,864
Obviously, it took some preparation.

33
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,659
Then, you're now...

34
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:25,038
a real persona of Kurumi
in her alter ego... Is that right?

35
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,040
Well, that's about it...

36
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,543
But more importantly, right now...

37
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,880
Zafkiel, Dalet.

38
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,301
At last...

39
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,805
at long last, I got it.

40
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,065
Ah... Ah...

41
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,485
It's overflowing... Keep it coming...

42
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:59,489
So this is the second Sephira...

43
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,076
I feel like I could do
anything right now...

44
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:04,786
Kurumi...

45
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,329
You...

46
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,962
What are you...

47
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,088
Shido!

48
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,089
Shido.

49
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,757
- Shido!
- Darling!

50
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:17,674
Mister!

51
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,550
Shido!

52
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,551
Shido!

53
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,678
Sorry, Shido. I'm late.

54
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,058
Kurumi?

55
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,686
Huh?
What's going on?!

56
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:33,815
I heard that DEMs are attacking
Darling and the others!

57
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:40,489
I have taken the role
of helping Shido...

58
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:42,616
Aside from that...

59
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:47,913
It seems that someone
more troublesome has arrived.

60
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,125
Shido, what is this?!

61
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,336
Mio!

62
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,631
I'm sorry, Shin.

63
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,218
To fall for such a diversion,

64
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,262
I guess I'm still not ready, huh...

65
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,181
But I'm glad you're safe.

66
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,517
And thank you, Kurumi.

67
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,020
You protected Shin for me.

68
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:19,027
My, my, being thanked by you would
remind me of something I detest.

69
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:23,406
Shido!

70
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,283
Mio's goal is to get Shido,

71
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,286
you should get out
while we buy you some time.

72
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,746
It's useless.

73
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:34,584
Right now I have a path
connected with Shin.

74
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,547
I also know the future that
Shin has experienced.

75
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,467
You can no longer
go back to the past again.

76
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,095
Shido?!

77
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,264
Stop, it's dangerous.

78
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:48,849
Mio.

79
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,518
Shin!

80
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,019
I...

81
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:56,690
could not seal your spiritual power...

82
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,194
I'm just a half-baked guy who hasn't
even collected all the Sephiras.

83
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:03,697
But...

84
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,366
I'm sure that's not the only reason.

85
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,620
To seal the spirit's power,

86
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,082
I have to open the spirit's heart
and then kiss her.

87
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,002
But you...

88
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,338
hadn't opened your heart to me yet.

89
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,257
Shin...

90
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,467
What do you mean?

91
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,847
Surely, at that time,
her likelihood of being sealed was...

92
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:29,890
You're wrong.

93
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,849
Huh?

94
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,518
That's wrong.

95
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,187
I'm not the one Mio likes.

96
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,480
Shin...

97
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,649
It's Shinji Takamiya!

98
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,777
And...

99
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,739
Shinji is...

100
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,782
already gone.

101
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,038
What... are you talking about, Shin?

102
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,542
That's why I tried
to recreate you, Shin.

103
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,671
I gave you the power of a spirit,

104
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,965
so that this time you would never die...

105
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,511
Yeah, your powers are really impressive.

106
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,222
However...

107
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,267
Assuming I collect all the Sephiras,

108
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:17,896
assuming you would erase the memory
of Shido Itsuka out of my head.

109
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,566
Am I really going to become Shinji?

110
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,904
It's just a human who looks like Shinji
and has the memory of Shinji...

111
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,782
However, that's not Shinji.

112
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,702
Shinji's soul is not there...

113
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,082
Surely you have figured that out.

114
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,086
Knowing what you were doing,
you had to hang on to it...

115
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,338
But...

116
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:47,467
Does that really
satisfy your heart, Mio?

117
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,517
Why do you say that, Shin?

118
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,645
Even though all I have is you, Shin...

119
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,524
I've lived this entire time,

120
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,485
just to see you once again, Shin.

121
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,987
That is bullshit!

122
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,781
You have me!

123
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,616
And the other spirits!

124
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,371
Was the time you spent with us...

125
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,749
not as good as the time
you spent with Shinji?

126
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,088
I see...

127
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,426
You can say things like that
because you're not Shin, huh...

128
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,138
I need to revert you back to Shin
as soon as possible...

129
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,766
Thanks for everything, Shido...

130
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,143
But...

131
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:41,020
It's time to say goodbye.

132
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,149
Sandalphon!

133
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,693
Thanks, you saved me.

134
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,902
Don't worry about it!

135
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,946
But what do we do now?

136
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,949
I will... kiss Mio once again!

137
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,952
What are you talking about?!

138
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,372
You said it yourself,
you don't have enough likability!

139
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:04,878
So this time, I will make her choose me,
not as Shinji, but as Shido Itsuka!

140
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:08,089
Otherwise, I'm sure Mio would...

141
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,010
Kurumi!

142
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,472
That was a close call, right?

143
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,640
Your dress...

144
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,726
It's a little embarrassing, but...

145
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:23,480
Now is not the time to talk about it.

146
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,774
More importantly,

147
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,860
you said something interesting.

148
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,489
You want to kiss Mio once again, huh?

149
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,657
Yeah, that's the plan.

150
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:38,411
You failed to seal it once,
didn't you, Shido?

151
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,372
Do you have any idea
what the odds are?

152
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:50,006
Is that what Mio really wants?

153
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,259
Are you saying that...

154
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,930
we were made into spirits
for such a thing?

155
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,139
Yeah...

156
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,391
I think...
There's no doubt about it.

157
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,145
Shido...

158
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,826
Once we are trapped in this space,
there is no escape, is there?

159
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,330
As long as Mio shares
your memories, Shido,

160
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,793
it should be possible to stop you
from going back in time with Zafkiel...

161
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,169
Then...

162
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,799
we must take a shot at even
the slightest chance of survival...

163
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,969
I have made it this far.

164
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,556
I hope you'll do it properly.

165
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,057
Yeah.

166
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,559
Thank you, Kurumi.

167
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,987
My, my...

168
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,407
You've gotten quite good at it,

169
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,825
Shido.

170
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:00,618
<i>My body feels light...</i>

171
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,371
<i>My whole body is full of energy...</i>

172
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,206
<i>I see...</i>

173
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:10,086
<i>Now I've gotten
all the power of 10 Sephiras.</i>

174
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,088
I can do this!

175
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,590
Shin.

176
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,862
- Mister!
- Shido!

177
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,498
Ike!

178
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,126
Are you okay, Ike?!

179
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,127
Ike!

180
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:01,596
Is this what it feels like to be pulled
out of a Qlipha while still alive...

181
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,391
It was a valuable experience.

182
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,685
This is not the time for jokes!

183
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:10,146
How's the situation?

184
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:14,484
It seems that Nightmare has
entrusted her power to Shido Itsuka.

185
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,902
And Goetia?

186
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,321
It is still next to the Fraxinus,

187
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,990
and the remote control
has not been interrupted.

188
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,075
I see.

189
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,455
Everything is going well, huh?

190
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,251
Kotori!

191
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,503
Are you all right?

192
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,171
Yes...

193
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,342
It's not that I'm wounded.
That's just my time limit.

194
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,802
More importantly...

195
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,222
This is...

196
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,308
Wondering. What is happening?

197
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:50,270
Kotori, is Shido safe?

198
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:55,233
Of course. There's no way Shido
would get screwed over like this.

199
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,193
Yeah... you're right.

200
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,820
Nia, did you hear me?

201
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,531
Can you bring the observation
equipment over here?

202
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,240
(Analyzing)

203
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:03,825
(Completed)

204
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,369
Hmm... It's no use.

205
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,745
No way!

206
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,042
Nia, please leave the rest to me.

207
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,335
Kurumin?

208
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,045
Rasiel.

209
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,216
Oh, God, you can do that?!

210
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:26,055
Well, if you took my Sephira from that
corrupt director, I guess you can do that.

211
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,724
Be quiet, please.

212
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:32,979
This is my first time using this angel,
so please let me concentrate...

213
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,982
This is Netorare, huh...

214
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,735
It's annoying!

215
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,862
Can you tell how Shido is doing?

216
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,488
Yes.

217
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,991
It seems he's fine.

218
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,296
This is...

219
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:21,611
That's right...

220
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,279
How is everyone?!

221
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,113
Shin.

222
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,075
Re-Reine?!

223
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,952
W-What's going on?

224
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,621
What about everyone?

225
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,039
How is Fraxinus?!

226
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,749
Your hand.

227
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,960
O-Okay...

228
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,259
Thank you so much.

229
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,388
Hey, over here!

230
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:51,808
Mio...

231
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,643
And...

232
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:03,611
M-Me?

233
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,115
No, it's not.

234
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:08,741
You are...

235
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:10,372
Shin.

236
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,995
Shinji Takamiya, huh?

237
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,330
Yeah.

238
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,375
Well, nice to meet you,

239
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,335
I guess...

240
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,845
What in the world is happening?

241
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:33,474
It looks like this is a space
formed by Ain Soph.

242
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,019
"It looks like," you say?

243
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,982
There is a path between you and me.

244
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:46,112
It seems this shared memory
is reproduced through it.

245
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,108
At that time,

246
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:51,659
in order to create
a state closer to memory,

247
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,787
the consciousness of me and Mio,

248
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,791
as well as that of Shido and Shin,
must have been separated.

249
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,793
I-I see...

250
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,628
I think that's not a problem!

251
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,215
Instead, let's have some fun.
We're in the sea, after all!

252
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,322
You did it, eh!

253
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,281
You!

254
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,242
Take this!

255
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,410
Stop!

256
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:54,370
Have you lost the feeling
that you were Shin?

257
00:16:54,371 --> 00:16:55,228
Huh?

258
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:57,850
Is this space able to read minds too?!

259
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,393
It's not like that.

260
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,980
I thought you might be like me.

261
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,276
When my existence was cut off,

262
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:12,156
my feelings as Mio may have been
transferred to the other Mio.

263
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,535
It's a strange feeling...

264
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:20,122
It's as if I really became
a different person

265
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,501
named Reine Murasame
apart from Mio Takamiya...

266
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,713
Reine...

267
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,551
It's so fun, right?

268
00:17:32,983 --> 00:17:36,446
I have to thank you
for bringing me here, Shin.

269
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:38,977
I'm glad you liked it.

270
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,521
And it took a lot of effort to
find a place with a nice view.

271
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,233
Shido.

272
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,360
I'm okay.

273
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,572
Oh, I wanted to try that one.

274
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,823
Fireworks!

275
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,033
When it comes to sea,
it's all about fireworks, isn't it?

276
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,830
I couldn't do it the last time
because I left in the evening.

277
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,540
I-It can't be helped.

278
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:06,168
If we don't get home by then,
we'll be late...

279
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,045
And Mana would be worried too.

280
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,381
And she'll think
I'm a bad influence...

281
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,385
In fact, we're going to
have a lot of fun doing it.

282
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:17,597
I'd love to try diving and barbecuing...

283
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,725
We'll do more and different things!

284
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,894
With the four of us,
me with Shin, and Reine with Shido.

285
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,396
I'm sure it will be fun!

286
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,609
Ah...

287
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,114
I really wish this moment
could go on forever.

288
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,825
Yeah, I hope so...

289
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,871
Though, it won't last forever...

290
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,581
Isn't that right,

291
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,291
Mio?

292
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:48,795
Mio...

293
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,922
I'm sorry.

294
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:54,884
It's just like what you said, Shido...

295
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,320
When I first kissed Reine,

296
00:19:07,321 --> 00:19:09,490
your memory flowed
into my mind, Mio...

297
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,819
And I didn't know what it was about,

298
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,238
I didn't even know what it meant...

299
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,449
But...

300
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,495
Finally...

301
00:19:23,817 --> 00:19:26,028
I finally figured it out...

302
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:31,337
Mio.

303
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,758
In order for you to revive
Shinji from the dead,

304
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,009
you gave birth to me again...

305
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,261
Isn't that, right?

306
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,224
However, that's not all.

307
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,054
Because Shinji that made by it...

308
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:49,105
wouldn't be the true Shinji.

309
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:54,977
I don't know if you yourself
were aware of it...

310
00:19:55,741 --> 00:19:59,470
But when I looked at your memories,
I figured something out.

311
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:02,060
Mio,

312
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,432
you gave birth to me
to create an entity

313
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:07,707
that could kill you.

314
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,815
How is it, Kurumi?

315
00:20:18,595 --> 00:20:21,637
On the beach, there were Shido, Mio...

316
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,848
and Miss Murasame?

317
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,017
And another Shido?

318
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,354
Huh?
Did you say there are two Misters?

319
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,273
It's strange...

320
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:35,443
Besides, Mio and Reine
were separated...

321
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:40,197
Suspicious. Is there a multiplying
effect in that cocoon?

322
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,534
I'll have to look into it to find out.

323
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,870
Why do they become like that...

324
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,334
W-What?!

325
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,755
An extremely strong spirit wave,
but where on earth did it come from...

326
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,047
Everyone, over there!

327
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:01,719
Origami!

328
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:02,734
Mana!

329
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,473
They must be up to something!

330
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,807
We will eliminate them!

331
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,560
Metatron!

332
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:18,944
It's useless.
