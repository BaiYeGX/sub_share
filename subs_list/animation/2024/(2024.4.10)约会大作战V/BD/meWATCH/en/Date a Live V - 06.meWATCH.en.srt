1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:08,800
Isaac Westcott.

2
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,346
What the hell are <i>you</i>?!

3
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:14,139
What the hell do you want?!

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,392
For what purpose
are you doing all this?!

5
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:41,458
<i>As far as my eyes can see,
colors abound</i>

6
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:47,214
<i>Scenes of the past, unravel, unwound</i>

7
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:52,678
<i>Paradox tightens,
the resolve we've found</i>

8
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:58,183
<i>Sinking into tomorrows,
out of bounds</i>

9
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,481
<i>If I open these hands,
once clenched tight</i>

10
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:12,573
<i>I'll grasp at hopes,
long lost from sight</i>

11
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:18,662
<i>Tears have dried,
facing the darkest night</i>

12
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:24,835
<i>Even as you gaze at a future bright</i>

13
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:30,132
<i>Finally, the light, almost within sight</i>

14
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:34,136
<i>No words needed,
in silence, take flight</i>

15
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:38,682
<i>For all the answers, here,</i>

16
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:45,522
<i>in our hands alight</i>

17
00:01:58,035 --> 00:02:01,955
When I was ten years old,
I realized for the first time

18
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,416
of who I actually was.

19
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:10,505
<i>My mother passed away.
And I was completely saddened</i>

20
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,799
<i>by the death of my kind mother.</i>

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,800
<i>But...</i>

22
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,763
<i>More than that, I felt ecstatic.</i>

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,391
<i>Sorrow and despair filled the moment.</i>

24
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,688
<i>And yet those feelings brought me
excitement and joy.</i>

25
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:32,944
<i>Apparently, I have a different sense
of reality from other people.</i>

26
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:40,952
<i>But I was careful in my life
not to let others know about it.</i>

27
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:48,210
<i>Including my closest friends.</i>

28
00:03:01,223 --> 00:03:06,228
Told ya. That's why
you can't be so forceful.

29
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:10,607
You should be calmer
and more gentle with your touch.

30
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,401
I'm trying...

31
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,237
I'll do it again, watch me.

32
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,790
Whoa...

33
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,255
All right, do it again.

34
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:34,965
Yeah.

35
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,721
Abracadabra!

36
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,848
I mean, that won't work, you know?

37
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:44,391
Elliot. Ellen.

38
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,894
You guys have been here all day?

39
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:49,896
Ike.

40
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,817
Yeah. As you can see,
we're doing a witchcraft exercise.

41
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:54,985
You see,

42
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,155
Ellen's never going
to get the hang of it, though.

43
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,491
Oh, come on.
You know that I can't do it that well.

44
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:05,871
But you and Ike can use
magic better than adults!

45
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,664
It's not fair!

46
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,125
But Karen can do it, right?

47
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,128
Why are you sisters
so different from each other?

48
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:14,504
Hmmph...

49
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,550
Oops, I'm sorry.
My bad. Stop crying, please.

50
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,264
It's okay, Ellen.

51
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,185
I'll help you too, let's go
to the training ground together.

52
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,564
If you practice outside,
you'll get the teacher mad at you again.

53
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,193
The grown-ups are
easily frightened, after all.

54
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:42,073
Even though no one will come to
such a peculiar place as this.

55
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:48,246
It can't be helped. They say wizards
like us were persecuted for a long time.

56
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,917
Especially the generation
of our teachers and parents.

57
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,338
<i>Back then, we were always together.</i>

58
00:04:57,047 --> 00:04:59,132
<i>Ellen, Elliot, and I.</i>

59
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,260
<i>And also Ellen's younger sister, Karen.</i>

60
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:07,766
But still, I think they're
outrageously too scared.

61
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:11,812
I mean, teachers wouldn't lose
a fight with a normal human being.

62
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,731
If only there were fewer of them, though.

63
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,484
But if one against a hundred,

64
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,612
or one against a thousand,
would be a different story, isn't it?

65
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,906
Well, yes, I guess.

66
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:25,951
People fear what is different from them.

67
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:29,788
And fear leads to outbursts and madness.

68
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:34,376
Not being known for who you are
is a virtue above all others.

69
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,422
I don't know what you're talking about.

70
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,140
Our village has been destroyed...

71
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,018
Sis, why did this happen?

72
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,187
Why has it ended up like this?

73
00:05:58,316 --> 00:05:58,775
Elliot!

74
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:00,819
You can't go there!

75
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,070
But I have to!

76
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,781
All we have to do now

77
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,033
is protect Ellen and Karen.

78
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:32,559
<i>I hoped that one day I would be even more
ecstatic than I was when my mother died.</i>

79
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,936
<i>This time, too,</i>

80
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,981
<i>I felt a similar sense
of joy and excitement...</i>

81
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,942
<i>over the sorrow and despair</i>

82
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,821
<i>of those dying and those left behind.</i>

83
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,618
Elliot, Ellen, Karen.

84
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,329
Let's build a world of wizards.

85
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:57,042
Let's annihilate humanity
and make a world for us, the Magus people.

86
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,670
They started all of this chaos.

87
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,340
There's no reason why
we shouldn't retaliate, is there?

88
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,344
I'll never forgive them.
Never!

89
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:12,349
<i>Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to retaliate.</i>

90
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,309
I'll have my revenge!

91
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:18,855
<i>Thank you for giving me
the opportunity to take my revenge.</i>

92
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,984
From now on,
we're standing alone on our side.

93
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,362
The whole world is our enemy!

94
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:29,115
Yes! Let's rebuild this world!

95
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:37,874
<i>Thank you</i>

96
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,669
<i>for making me</i>

97
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,004
<i>a victim.</i>

98
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,134
<i>The four of us were then
temporarily sheltered</i>

99
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,929
<i>in an orphanage in the city.</i>

100
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,016
<i>Without revealing our identity, of course.</i>

101
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,771
<i>About three years later,</i>

102
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,691
<i>I was taken in by a wealthy couple.</i>

103
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,070
<i>Eventually, they died
in an "unfortunate accident"</i>

104
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,240
<i>and the property became mine.</i>

105
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:18,540
<i>I called on Elliot, Ellen, and Karen,</i>

106
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,376
<i>and we immersed ourselves
in the study of witchcraft.</i>

107
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,755
<i>In order to find a way to retaliate</i>

108
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,800
<i>against this world,
and against all people.</i>

109
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,852
<i>Then...</i>

110
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:40,687
<i>that day came.</i>

111
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:43,451
Karen.

112
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:44,691
Get ready.

113
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:45,734
Will do.

114
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:59,581
Ike, are we going to
execute this spirit formula?

115
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,248
Yeah.

116
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:02,417
The spirit will be born.

117
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,670
The mana in the world is
gathered to a single point

118
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,465
and new life can be created.

119
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,342
Together with the new world

120
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:13,678
that will overwhelm the world.

121
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,848
The Voluntary Domain.

122
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:21,853
An all-round space where what people
envision becomes reality.

123
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,397
If my calculations are correct,

124
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,359
the space that the spirits
born from here would hold

125
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,529
would be large enough
to cover the entire planet.

126
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,658
Talk about the world next to this world,

127
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,120
the "Neighboring World",
or whatever you want to call it...

128
00:09:40,109 --> 00:09:42,123
That will be our world.

129
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:47,337
We overwrite this world
with the Neighboring World.

130
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:54,260
When the spirits appear,
the aftermath is predictable.

131
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:55,820
Elliot.

132
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,889
Prepare for protection.

133
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,618
Yeah.

134
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,242
The atmosphere seems to
have changed a bit from before.

135
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,413
Do you recall that I killed you

136
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:49,042
when you were Shinji Takamiya?

137
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,293
Screw you, bastard!

138
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,337
It seems that
you've got it all figured out.

139
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:57,508
I only guessed from the fact
that Deus showed up,

140
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,136
but it tickles my brain again.

141
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,640
She really has a wonderful power.

142
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,560
However, I'm now in jeopardy.

143
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,689
I am flattered that Deus has turned up,

144
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:17,111
but it would be impossible for me
to harness her power now.

145
00:12:17,782 --> 00:12:19,072
For that,

146
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:21,824
Shido Itsuka,

147
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,244
I've decided

148
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,205
to take the spiritual power you possess

149
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,958
in order to reach her first.

150
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,959
What?!

151
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,049
Sandalphon!

152
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:39,968
Zadkiel!

153
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,719
Raphael!

154
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,179
Metatron!

155
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,809
Bring it on, Wizard!

156
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,022
I'll settle this fast!

157
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,359
I'll show you that
you're not ready for this fight!

158
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,202
Yuzuru...

159
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:10,832
The place is already under
the control of Ain Soph Aur.

160
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,835
It's not a space that can sustain life

161
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,629
without spiritual or magical power.

162
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,597
Don't do it, Yuzuru!

163
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,985
My apology.
I'm very sorry.

164
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:40,987
Tohka.

165
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,697
Kaguya...

166
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,829
Yuzuru...

167
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,748
Kaguya...

168
00:13:57,754 --> 00:13:59,130
I have two now.

169
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,381
Damn you!

170
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,884
You were a bit of a problem

171
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,386
and I wanted to deal with you later.

172
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,563
Are you okay, Tohka?

173
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,440
Mukuro. Thanks.

174
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,483
You saved me.

175
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,985
Are you okay, Tohka?!

176
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,113
Tohka, where are Kaguya and Yuzuru?

177
00:14:34,648 --> 00:14:37,210
Is that the Spirit of Origin?

178
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,505
Gosh, I hate seeing things
that worsen my mood.

179
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,006
Ah!

180
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,384
It's been a while, Mana.

181
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,010
Huh? What?!

182
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,681
I have to retrieve Sephira now.

183
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,351
But I assure you that
I won't kill you.

184
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,019
So stay away from here.

185
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:01,025
It can't be helped, then.
If I take it too easy,

186
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,944
Shin will return.

187
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,738
I'll make this quick.

188
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,869
<i>Those sparkles...</i>

189
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,039
<i>Elliot...</i>

190
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,801
Hey.
Are you finally awake?

191
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:36,436
"This is my victory," I guess?

192
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,520
Right?

193
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,940
Kill me.

194
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,691
Huh?

195
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,695
You're bloody right.
This is your victory, Elliot.

196
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:47,738
I cannot live

197
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,450
in disgrace any longer.

198
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,593
What's the meaning of this, Elliot?!

199
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,386
What do you mean?

200
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,139
I would need to
neutralize my enemy, obviously.

201
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,351
It's too dangerous to
let you have a realizer.

202
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,229
That's not what I meant!

203
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,398
Why didn't you kill me already?!

204
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,859
The loser shouldn't tell
the winner what to do, you idiot.

205
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,820
Bold of you to call me stupid!

206
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,113
You've got to be kidding me!

207
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,032
I'm not joking around.

208
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:33,117
It's up to me if I want to kill or not.

209
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,536
"I'm not joking" my arse!

210
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,330
Are you bloody making fun of me?!

211
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,624
Like I said, you're an idiot!

212
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,211
Why are you like this?

213
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,922
You have always made fun of me

214
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,715
and treated me like a child!

215
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,801
Even in this situation,
you still put your affection to me!

216
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:55,139
Why do you not recognize me
as your enemy?! Why?!

217
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:59,018
Geez, shut up.
Quit yapping already, will you?

218
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:03,940
Why...

219
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,527
Why didn't you take me with you?

220
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,819
Elliot...

221
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm running out of power.

222
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,962
I didn't expect it'd be this quick.

223
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,340
I thought I had enough time

224
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,008
to see Karen again...

225
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,762
I'm sorry, Karen,

226
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,805
Ellen.

227
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,558
Now...

228
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,102
I'm sorry, boy,

229
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,020
looks like I'm done here.

230
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:45,439
I will leave the rest to you.

231
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,485
So beautiful...

232
00:17:58,562 --> 00:18:00,121
Ain Soph.

233
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,850
What is this?

234
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,018
Territory?

235
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,478
But is this...

236
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,772
You're not wrong.

237
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,484
The DEM has developed
a technology modeled on this,

238
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,447
called "Territory,"
the Voluntary Domain.

239
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,910
However, this territory of mine
is constantly unfolding.

240
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,332
It's a thin layer of membrane
away from this world.

241
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:46,417
And now,

242
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:50,463
I have summoned
a part of its nucleus, Ain Soph, here.

243
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:55,217
So now this whole area around me

244
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,887
has become the Neighboring World.

245
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,263
Neighboring World?

246
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,306
Hmm...

247
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:04,560
I don't know what kind
of power Ain Soph actually has.

248
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,521
But it won't matter if we stop you!

249
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,106
Michael!

250
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:09,940
Segva!

251
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,025
Stop, Mukuro!

252
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,906
Mukuro!

253
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,368
Michael, the power that
can close all kinds of things.

254
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,622
It is not impossible for you
to shut down Ain Soph's power.

255
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,250
It's perfectly reasonable
to assume that, but...

256
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:32,880
This is the Neighboring World
that has encroached on our world,

257
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,548
<i>my</i> own world.

258
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,511
All laws, and all laws of nature

259
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,680
are different from your world.

260
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,433
Here, it is impossible

261
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:47,728
to attack Ain Soph.

262
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,857
Yes, in this world,

263
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,069
everything goes my way.

264
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:00,199
Now I've got the third.

265
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,450
We better escape.

266
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:09,542
As expected, Mana.
Good choice.

267
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,251
And now...

268
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,171
I'll make sure that...

269
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,590
"Those in this world cannot get out."

270
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,262
She added the rule?!

271
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,515
Gosh! So you can do
anything you want, huh?!

272
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:26,350
That's right.

273
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,520
This whole world is at my command.

274
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,610
Mana, I've put you through
a lot of hardship over the years.

275
00:20:37,365 --> 00:20:38,279
Get off me!

276
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,499
Mio?

277
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:53,586
Do you remember me?

278
00:20:53,586 --> 00:20:55,713
Just wait a bit,

279
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:58,966
because I'm sure Shin will need you.

280
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,721
Mana!

281
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,972
Mana!

282

Metatron!

283
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,899
Metatron!

284
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,778
Zadkiel!

285
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,908
Then let's forbid that too.

286

Yoshino!

287
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,517
