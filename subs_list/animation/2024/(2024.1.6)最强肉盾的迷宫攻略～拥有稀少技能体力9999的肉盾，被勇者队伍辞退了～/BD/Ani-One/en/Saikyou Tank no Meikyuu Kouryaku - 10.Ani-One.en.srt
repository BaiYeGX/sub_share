1
00:00:01,098 --> 00:00:03,901
"There are too many adventurers."
"I don't like the smell on them."

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,407
"The tourists litter."

3
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:09,108
"Please build a theatre."

4
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:10,707
"Please build more roads."

5
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,194
"Please station knights in Avancier."

6
00:00:14,713 --> 00:00:17,408
These are the requests
of the town residents.

7
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,505
There are more besides those.

8
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:22,707
Please go through them, Big Brother.

9
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:25,304
I'll go clean up.

10
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:26,498
Lime,

11
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:28,212
let's race to the second floor!

12
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:36,653
The sound of Manicia
running energetically up the stairs

13
00:00:36,654 --> 00:00:38,405
is truly wonderful.

14
00:00:39,311 --> 00:00:40,791
Still,

15
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,802
I didn't expect
to receive so many petitions.

16
00:00:42,803 --> 00:00:45,698
I'm glad we formed an alliance
with the two major clans,

17
00:00:45,699 --> 00:00:48,392
but even problems can arise
from such rapid development.

18
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:52,093
Rud, come with me!

19
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:56,603
Nin? What's wrong?

20
00:00:56,604 --> 00:00:57,702
This way!

21
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:00,593
This girl collapsed on the road.

22
00:01:04,894 --> 00:01:07,219
She's a Homunculus.

23
00:01:11,411 --> 00:01:12,996
Please… Please help us!

24
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,617
I have friends!

25
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,302
We were attacked in the forest nearby!

26
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:18,869
Let's go.

27
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,704
Yes.

28
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:20,581
Master,

29
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:21,749
I'll go too.

30
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:24,504
No, you need to stay here, Luna.

31
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,308
You treated her injuries.

32
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:29,706
She'll feel safer with you here.

33
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:33,589
I understand.

34
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:47,649
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

35
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:54,798
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

36
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,408
Around the labyrinth?

37
00:03:08,308 --> 00:03:11,190
But I'm the one managing
the labyrinth right now.

38
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,704
There shouldn't be monsters
spawning outside.

39
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:15,997
Found them.

40
00:03:17,803 --> 00:03:20,505
The Homunculi are fighting each other!

41
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:24,996
One side's clearly at a disadvantage.

42
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,980
And the side that's under attack

43
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,803
clearly has emotions
like the girl we found.

44
00:03:37,208 --> 00:03:40,308
I am an adventurer
from a nearby town called Avancier.

45
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,006
Please listen to what I have to say.

46
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,311
Please.

47
00:03:47,305 --> 00:03:48,305
It's not working.

48
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:53,916
Your friend came to our town
and asked me to help you.

49
00:03:58,998 --> 00:04:01,498
That girl's abilities are on par
with the pursuers.

50
00:04:06,107 --> 00:04:09,099
You must be the Homunculi she meant.

51
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:17,192
Yes, it's us.

52
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,894
So, who are these?

53
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:24,310
They are combat-type Homunculi
from Brunn Quelez.

54
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,412
Brunn Quelez?

55
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,103
Luna escaped from that country.

56
00:04:30,786 --> 00:04:32,147
In other words,

57
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,565
these are illegally created Homunculi.

58
00:04:34,812 --> 00:04:35,651
Nin,

59
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,108
heal them.

60
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:37,913
On it.

61
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,698
"Area High Heal"!

62
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,699
I was wondering
what all the ruckus was about.

63
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,599
It appears things
have gotten a bit tricky.

64
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:51,700
It's only natural
that they would feel uneasy.

65
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,100
After all,
something that should have been forbidden

66
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:54,499
suddenly appeared in front of them.

67
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,089
So even though
they're combat-type Homunculi,

68
00:04:58,089 --> 00:04:59,173
they don't possess
emotions or consciousness

69
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,501
like you guys do?

70
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:02,211
That's right.

71
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,387
They're only after us
to complete the order

72
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,704
to exterminate all those who escaped.

73
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:10,611
I see.

74
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,647
That means we'll have to defeat them.

75
00:05:14,373 --> 00:05:16,410
Although they're Homunculi…

76
00:05:16,994 --> 00:05:18,515
No, it's precisely so
that I can't bring myself to do it.

77
00:05:19,994 --> 00:05:22,404
Because they might be able

78
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:26,300
to laugh or cry like Luna...

79
00:05:27,108 --> 00:05:28,744
Can't you bring yourself to do it?

80
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,871
Amos.

81
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,895
In the end, they are merely puppets

82
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,404
bestowed a semblance of life.

83
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,881
Her words are cold,

84
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,758
but she must have said them
for my peace of mind.

85
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:48,348
Their movements don't seem very swift.

86
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:54,315
They can still attack
even after losing a limb.

87
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:57,500
This is indeed something
only a Homunculus could do.

88
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,303
I won't be able to block it in time.

89
00:06:09,706 --> 00:06:10,996
It's different from before.

90
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,193
Is it because I still have
my shield force?

91
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:15,506
I feel much lighter than usual.

92
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,311
Finally, it's over.

93
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:26,705
Rud, I've healed them.

94
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,902
Um,

95
00:06:29,517 --> 00:06:33,304
your friend is
in something like a house of ours.

96
00:06:33,971 --> 00:06:34,978
Will you come too?

97
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,856
Some look uneasy,

98
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,524
while others are filled with hostility.

99
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,608
They really are quite different.

100
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,502
But we can't force them.

101
00:06:43,001 --> 00:06:44,002
The way they're dressed,

102
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,006
they must've been treated very inhumanely.

103
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,608
It's likely they hate humans too.

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,909
Um...

105
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,202
If you'll let us,

106
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,805
can we come with you?

107
00:06:54,803 --> 00:06:57,500
Honestly,
I'm not the biggest fan of humans.

108
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,207
But some of us are wounded,

109
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:03,401
and we have nowhere else to go.

110
00:07:07,904 --> 00:07:10,404
We brought the Homunculi we rescued

111
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,183
to the clan house.

112
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:16,304
That settles it for now.

113
00:07:16,305 --> 00:07:18,405
We can protect them here,

114
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,407
but what do you plan to do next?

115
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:23,400
They're Homunculi from Brunn Quelez.

116
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,108
Then we must inform the governor
at the lord's mansion.

117
00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:29,199
The information will reach
the upper echelons of the country.

118
00:07:29,899 --> 00:07:31,609
If that happens,
we might not be able to protect them.

119
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:35,202
And the townsfolk
might also be wary of them.

120
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:36,705
I know.

121
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,998
-Fortunately, the governor in Avancier
-You can stay here

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,002
-is kind.
-without worry.

123
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,703
He will hear us out, at the very least.

124
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:45,198
Um...

125
00:07:46,411 --> 00:07:47,712
Thank you for helping us.

126
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:49,605
My name is Fia.

127
00:07:51,002 --> 00:07:52,895
Are you going to meet
with the local authorities?

128
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,302
Yes.

129
00:07:54,303 --> 00:07:56,098
Can I come with you?

130
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,312
It might be easier for a party involved
to speak to them.

131
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,301
They probably want to know
about the situation in Brunn Quelez too.

132
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:07,109
But they might be cautious of you.

133
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:10,612
Well, you can tie up my hands and feet.

134
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:14,310
I'm not one not to repay my debts.

135
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,871
I'll tell you everything

136
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:17,997
I can.

137
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,298
I see.

138
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,300
But there's no need
to tie up your hands and feet.

139
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:25,898
In that case...

140
00:08:28,304 --> 00:08:29,499
I've never seen her before.

141
00:08:29,995 --> 00:08:33,194
I heard a group of people with magic stones
on them were brought to the clan house.

142
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,795
Mr. Rud lead them there.

143
00:08:35,795 --> 00:08:37,706
Are they Homunculi?

144
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:39,210
Is this really all right?

145
00:08:40,598 --> 00:08:41,980
Um, Rud...

146
00:08:42,498 --> 00:08:43,203
Yes?

147
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,198
I asked you to hold my hand
as a safety precaution,

148
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:48,193
but we've certainly
attracted a lot of attention.

149
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,005
I apologise

150
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:52,099
for any inconveniences caused.

151
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,313
I don't think that at all.

152
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,689
I'm the one who should apologise.

153
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:00,211
The people of Avancier
have never seen a Homunculus.

154
00:09:01,401 --> 00:09:03,400
But they don't mean any ill intent.

155
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:05,005
It's okay. I don't mind.

156
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,005
We were prepared

157
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,789
before we left that country.

158
00:09:11,097 --> 00:09:12,010
I see.

159
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:16,103
Also,

160
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:18,010
you don't have to force yourself to smile.

161
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,093
At least not when you're with me.

162
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:28,497
I see. I understand what happened.

163
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,103
It's been hard on you, Fia.

164
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:39,789
So that country is creating Homunculi.

165
00:09:40,298 --> 00:09:42,409
Were you already aware of this, sir?

166
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,876
Only rumours.

167
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,005
I hear they do not treat
the Homunculi kindly.

168
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:53,597
Can I shelter them in this town
to protect them?

169
00:09:53,598 --> 00:09:54,802
To protect them?

170
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:56,137
Of course,

171
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,093
them having nowhere else to go
is one of the reasons.

172
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,267
But more importantly, if they stay,

173
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,511
they may solve the problem
of the lack of manpower.

174
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:06,498
Are you planning to hire the Homunculi?

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,895
Precisely.

176
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:09,817
They possess their own will

177
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:12,399
and can act accordingly.

178
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,613
You make a fair point.

179
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:18,300
I could tell
just by looking at this child.

180
00:10:19,506 --> 00:10:21,206
They're nothing different from humans,

181
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,324
and they're very expressive.

182
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:27,788
Well then, Fia,

183
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,398
I have some questions for you.

184
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,699
When it comes to the Homunculi,

185
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,600
Commander-type with thinking ability
and self-awareness

186
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:36,697
and combat-type
with enhanced combat skills.

187
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:39,607
Besides these, there seem
to be various types of Homunculi.

188
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,035
By chance do you know the reason

189
00:10:43,036 --> 00:10:44,801
for such rapid advancement
of Homunculi technology?

190
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,500
Well,

191
00:10:47,193 --> 00:10:50,410
it's said that about 20 years ago,

192
00:10:50,411 --> 00:10:53,493
a man known as Demon Lord Greed
appeared in Brunn Quelez.

193
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:54,307
A demon lord?

194
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:57,102
We all thought demon lords were fictional.

195
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:58,600
Why would he appear in Brunn Quelez?

196
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,990
I don't know the exact reason,

197
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,245
but it seems

198
00:11:02,246 --> 00:11:06,600
that the remarkable development
of Homunculus technology

199
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:07,792
is indeed attributed to Demon Lord Greed.

200
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,100
Even now, they continue
to mass-produce Homunculi like us.

201
00:11:15,402 --> 00:11:16,925
I understand the general situation.

202
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,845
I'll convey this information
to higher-ups.

203
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:20,722
Furthermore,

204
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,891
we will provide
your group protection in Avancier.

205
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,518
Thank you very much!

206
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,804
Looks like we get to stay in town
for the time being.

207
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:31,297
Yes.

208
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:34,800
But in a way you guys
are also being monitored.

209
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,214
I understand.

210
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:37,697
By the way,

211
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,096
wasn't there a girl back in the forest

212
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:41,514
who could hold her own against
a combat-type Homunculus?

213
00:11:41,997 --> 00:11:43,784
Saminina?

214
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:47,520
She's pretty tough
for a commander-type Homunculus.

215
00:11:48,297 --> 00:11:51,505
If anything were to happen,
she could be a formidable force.

216
00:11:52,506 --> 00:11:54,013
She's not the friendliest,

217
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:56,201
but she genuinely cares for her friends.

218
00:11:56,202 --> 00:11:58,403
I can see that.

219
00:11:59,092 --> 00:12:00,002
CHUCKLE

220
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:03,498
Some of our kind resents humans

221
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:05,392
because of the horrors
we've suffered in the past.

222
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,852
But you helped us and let us know

223
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,982
that there are human beings out there
who will treat Homunculi kindly.

224
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,709
Those of you who have followed us here
should have realised that.

225
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,401
So,

226
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,364
even though they might not
let their guard down immediately,

227
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,409
everyone will surely understand one day.

228
00:12:23,103 --> 00:12:24,014
That's true.

229
00:12:26,894 --> 00:12:28,595
What can I do

230
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:30,613
to help them integrate into the life here?

231
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:33,936
That's the situation.

232
00:12:33,936 --> 00:12:36,905
All of you will be allowed
to stay in town for protection.

233
00:12:37,497 --> 00:12:38,195
So

234
00:12:38,196 --> 00:12:41,206
I'm hoping you can do something
to help the town.

235
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,994
Can you tell me what you're good at?

236
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,695
I'm not sure if we're good at it,

237
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:46,710
but in Brunn Quelez,

238
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:47,800
we are responsible
for making clothes, weapons,

239
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,893
or building facilities
that are insufficient.

240
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,002
We have also built towns.

241
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,406
That's very impressive.

242
00:12:53,407 --> 00:12:54,997
It seems you guys
are skilled in many things.

243
00:12:55,377 --> 00:12:59,207
But Saminina's better at fighting
than making things.

244
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:03,104
No... I don't want to work.

245
00:13:03,798 --> 00:13:06,003
We'll be abused again.

246
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:07,309
They'll beat us with whips.

247
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:09,198
I don't want to work for humans.

248
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:10,791
I almost forgot

249
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:14,400
that they used to work
under terrible conditions.

250
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,208
I have to quell their anxieties first.

251
00:13:17,911 --> 00:13:19,298
It's work,

252
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:21,197
but never more than
a reasonable number of hours.

253
00:13:21,197 --> 00:13:22,603
How long is that?

254
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,003
Normally, it should be from 9 AM to 6 PM.

255
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:27,313
You'll be given breaks as well, of course.

256
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:28,989
That's…

257
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:29,684
So short!

258
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:30,792
I can't believe it!

259
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:33,093
-We even get breaks?
-We won't be yelled at, will we?

260
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:35,806
It seems their previous
working environment was really harsh.

261
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:40,093
We'll decide the details
of the job and the hours later.

262
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:41,799
Anyway, thank you all very much.

263
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:43,899
What's wrong?

264
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:45,700
It's just that...

265
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:49,206
People don't thank the Homunculi,

266
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,704
so that was a little surprising.

267
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,217
I see.

268
00:13:53,609 --> 00:13:55,793
Work for the Homunculi?

269
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,292
In that case, how about this?

270
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,589
We'll build a public bathhouse.

271
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,716
Sounds good.

272
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:04,808
We've gotten requests for a theatre
and more guards too,

273
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:06,100
but a public bathhouse might be better.

274
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:10,007
Those adventurers could certainly use it.

275
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:13,109
Some of them are rather unhygienic...

276
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,313
The public bathhouse it is, then.

277
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,098
Manicia,

278
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:19,000
could I have you write up
the proposal to the governor?

279
00:14:19,404 --> 00:14:20,011
Certainly.

280
00:14:23,098 --> 00:14:24,211
By the way,

281
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:27,410
don't you think Luna's been acting
a little strange lately?

282
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:28,798
Has she?

283
00:14:28,798 --> 00:14:29,506
Yes.

284
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:31,500
Can I stay with the Homunculi

285
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,301
at the clan house for a while?

286
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:38,793
She seemed very concerned
about the Homunculi.

287
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,104
She didn't leave the second floor today.

288
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,813
Does she have some sort of attachment
towards the Homunculi?

289
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:50,705
Luna.

290
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:52,600
Master.

291
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:53,706
Let me give you a hand.

292
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:55,499
Did something happen?

293
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,504
Hmm, well, how should I put it?

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,404
I have something to tell you.

295
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:04,592
Since the Homunculi came to Avancier,

296
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:06,399
you've been quite busy.

297
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,698
So, I was thinking, um...

298
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,695
It might be good for us
to have a chat once in a while.

299
00:15:11,105 --> 00:15:12,010
Of course.

300
00:15:12,814 --> 00:15:15,604
Although it's been decided
to build a public bathhouse,

301
00:15:16,086 --> 00:15:17,001
can they still stay here

302
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:18,605
once it's finished?

303
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:20,377
Will they be dismissed

304
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,707
after it's done?

305
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:22,608
Don't worry.

306
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:26,202
The higher-ups have already decided
to leave me in charge of everything.

307
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,010
I see.

308
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,802
Luna, are you okay?

309
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,902
You've been spending a lot of time
with the Homunculi lately.

310
00:15:33,398 --> 00:15:35,893
It seems you've also heard
about what happened in Brunn Quelez.

311
00:15:36,798 --> 00:15:38,007
Yes.

312
00:15:38,711 --> 00:15:41,702
I feel so grateful and fortunate

313
00:15:41,702 --> 00:15:44,092
to be brought back by Master.

314
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:49,496
Maybe Luna doesn't remember much
about life in that country.

315
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,109
That's why it was quite a shock to her
when she learned

316
00:15:52,111 --> 00:15:53,490
what happened to the other Homunculi.

317
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,300
Speaking of which,

318
00:15:58,292 --> 00:15:59,607
have you told them

319
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,102
that you're a Homunculus?

320
00:16:03,205 --> 00:16:04,708
No, I haven't told any of them.

321
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:06,812
If I told them,

322
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:09,896
it might cause you trouble.

323
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,200
I see.

324
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:14,693
I keep missing the timing
to tell them as well.

325
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:17,106
It'd be better if we could tell them soon.

326
00:16:17,107 --> 00:16:18,297
Yes.

327
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,892
But...

328
00:16:19,918 --> 00:16:24,505
someday, when the people in town
aren't afraid of the Homunculi anymore,

329
00:16:24,506 --> 00:16:26,236
I'll tell them my real identity.

330
00:16:27,004 --> 00:16:30,704
I want them to live happily
as soon as possible,

331
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:32,603
so I will do my best.

332
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:34,994
Mm. Everything will work out.

333
00:16:36,002 --> 00:16:37,116
I know you can do it.

334
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:40,305
I'm really glad

335
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:41,840
I helped you.

336
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,627
Master...

337
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:53,200
Thank you very much.

338
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:57,998
In order to the solve the problem
faced by Luna and the other Homunculi,

339
00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:00,728
there is something I must find out.

340
00:17:01,502 --> 00:17:03,606
And who are you looking for?

341
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,598
Amos, just the one I was looking for…

342
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,000
Rud!

343
00:17:07,001 --> 00:17:10,093
Did you make this long journey
just to find me?

344
00:17:10,094 --> 00:17:13,801
Have I completely captivated you?

345
00:17:13,802 --> 00:17:15,814
Hey! Don't cling to me!

346
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,492
Ouch…

347
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:18,788
Hey! Rud!

348
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:21,895
How can I be a role model for my students
if they see me in this state?

349
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:23,103
Students?

350
00:17:23,104 --> 00:17:25,294
I've started teaching magic.

351
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,699
After all,
I have a lot of free time on my hands.

352
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:30,208
Meanwhile, things are hectic on my end.

353
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:32,203
We could really use extra help
for the construction.

354
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:34,694
Let the Homunculi
handle that kind of work.

355
00:17:35,197 --> 00:17:38,391
I only do things that interest me.

356
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:44,311
I want them all to learn magic
from the demon lord herself,

357
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,496
so they can all be future candidates
for demon lords.

358
00:17:47,006 --> 00:17:47,898
That's right.

359
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:50,709
I came to ask you about demon lords.

360
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,602
About me?

361
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,908
No, about Demon Lord Greed.

362
00:17:54,905 --> 00:17:59,787
Apparently, it was him who brought
the Homunculi technology to Brunn Quelez.

363
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:05,785
That bloke has always
had a penchant for research.

364
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,212
Even if he knows a thing or two
about Homunculus technology,

365
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,198
it's nothing surprising.

366
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:13,515
Heard he's currently
mass-producing Homunculi.

367
00:18:13,516 --> 00:18:14,927
Do you know what his purpose is?

368
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:17,500
Like, is he planning on invading
other countries or something?

369
00:18:17,995 --> 00:18:19,484
He is probably the last person

370
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:21,225
who would consider such intentions.

371
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,393
Then why is he mass-producing Homunculi?

372
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:25,605
Probably just to pass the time.

373
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:29,108
Just to pass the time?

374
00:18:30,005 --> 00:18:32,510
Well, us demon lords
aren't exactly restricted by a lifespan.

375
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:34,397
Even if we die,

376
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:37,741
one day we'll resurrect
in the same manner.

377
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,403
Immortal, some might say.

378
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:42,105
I've heard that when you die,
you lose your memories

379
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:44,398
and come back to life somewhere else.

380
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:48,501
Although some can vaguely recall
their past memories,

381
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,800
most forget everything
and simply live on.

382
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:53,396
That's how it is.

383
00:18:53,397 --> 00:18:55,307
Since we demon lords don't die,

384
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:58,595
we look for matters to occupy our time.

385
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,139
So, manufacturing Homunculi
is Greed's pastime

386
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:04,412
to while away his lengthy existence?

387
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:06,895
Not exactly.

388
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,413
Greed has always sought
to create "the strongest".

389
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:15,195
His research of the Homunculi
is most likely

390
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:18,032
one of his many studies.

391
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,890
To create the strongest?

392
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,745
I suppose

393
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,373
the illegal Homunculi are the closest
to being the "strongest".

394
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:29,799
You're one to talk,
being the closest to "strongest".

395
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:33,010
The power you possess is something

396
00:19:33,011 --> 00:19:37,110
that even Greed,
after years of research, cannot obtain.

397
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,596
Mana, strengthened by the power
of the demon lord.

398
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,313
Shield force,
enhanced by the power of god.

399
00:19:43,314 --> 00:19:46,484
Possess both, and only then
does one become the strongest.

400
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,700
This is the conclusion
that Greed has reached through research.

401
00:19:49,311 --> 00:19:52,505
Didn't you use it when you fought me?

402
00:19:53,516 --> 00:19:55,299
The power at that time?

403
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:59,201
Now I understand
that Greed is pursuing the "strongest".

404
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:02,303
But why create the Homunculi?

405
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,508
Most probably
to experiment on their bodies.

406
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,206
So, he created Luna
and all those Homunculi

407
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,413
just to use them as his test subjects?

408
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,292
He put them

409
00:20:14,293 --> 00:20:17,188
through all that suffering
just for his research?

410
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,104
You've got to be kidding me!

411
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:20,910
Are you angry?

412
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,399
Of course, I am!

413
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,889
Those kids have feelings.

414
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,794
How can I overlook
the atrocities he committed?

415
00:20:28,498 --> 00:20:31,007
What labyrinth is Greed in now?

416
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:33,805
What? Are you going to take him down?

417
00:20:33,806 --> 00:20:35,208
He's a very powerful man.

418
00:20:35,998 --> 00:20:37,807
With your current strength,

419
00:20:37,808 --> 00:20:40,391
you might not be able
to defeat Greed at all his might.

420
00:20:41,999 --> 00:20:42,803
And even if

421
00:20:42,804 --> 00:20:46,787
you do want to defeat him,
your "strongest" power can be troublesome.

422
00:20:47,602 --> 00:20:50,300
Magic elements come from monsters.

423
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,412
Used excessively,

424
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:55,005
one's body could become closer
to that of a demon.

425
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,698
Are you telling me to avoid using it?

426
00:20:58,093 --> 00:20:59,793
You should learn to control it.

427
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:03,415
Those who cannot control mana
will become monsters.

428
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:04,799
However,

429
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,406
control it well

430
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:09,908
and you might just turn into a demon lord.

431
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:12,193
I have no interest

432
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:14,113
in becoming a demon lord.

433
00:21:14,704 --> 00:21:15,704
I see.

434
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:19,302
Well, it's almost time for my lesson.

435
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,296
Let's talk another day, Rud.

436
00:21:27,105 --> 00:21:29,798
In order to protect everyone
when Greed attacks,

437
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,794
I have to become stronger.

438
00:21:40,804 --> 00:21:41,995
Destroy it.
