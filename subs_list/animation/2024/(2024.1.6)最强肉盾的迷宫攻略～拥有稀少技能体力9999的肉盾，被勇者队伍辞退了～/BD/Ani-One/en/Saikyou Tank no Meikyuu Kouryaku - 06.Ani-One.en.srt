1
00:00:00,602 --> 00:00:02,794
I'll wipe out all the Fieldsauruses!

2
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:03,901
The town

3
00:00:03,902 --> 00:00:06,298
has undergone tremendous changes.

4
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:07,206
All the materials are mine!

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,800
I have to deal with the disputes again.

6
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,194
Yo, Rud.

7
00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:15,096
That's a troubled face you have there.

8
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:16,296
Bu. Gali.

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,393
You just became the leader of a clan.

10
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:21,203
I suppose this is a bit much
on your shoulders.

11
00:00:21,204 --> 00:00:24,894
Maybe you should
let someone else handle things?

12
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:27,110
Yes, about that,

13
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,099
I have a favour to ask of you.

14
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:32,199
Welcome back.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,206
Oh. Another dispute?

16
00:00:34,206 --> 00:00:35,101
Yes.

17
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,998
Well, Fieldsauruses are perfect
for making potions and weapons,

18
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:42,793
so it's no surprise
everyone's keen to take them down.

19
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:44,991
I guess you do need some help

20
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,589
to run a clan.

21
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,503
Yes.

22
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:52,399
Manicia's handling the day-to-day stuff,

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:53,998
but we can't let her be too overworked.

24
00:00:55,506 --> 00:00:57,303
I asked Lilia, but…

25
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,008
Sorry.

26
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:01,401
My information bank isn't enough
to guide you through this.

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,106
Maybe you should ask the other clans.

28
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,498
The other clans, huh?

29
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:08,207
Though, the ideal situation

30
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:10,694
would be to form an alliance
with other clans.

31
00:01:11,098 --> 00:01:13,708
That way, you'll be on equal standing.

32
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,207
If you end up under another clan,

33
00:01:15,207 --> 00:01:18,495
it'd defeat the whole purpose
of establishing a clan in the first place.

34
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:19,201
ALLIANCE
A CLAN LEADER, B CLAN LEADER

35
00:01:19,202 --> 00:01:20,505
But if you want to ally with another clan,

36
00:01:20,506 --> 00:01:23,602
it might be challenging if you don't have
something to bring to the table.

37
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:25,211
"A CLAN LEADER, B CLAN LEADER"
True.

38
00:01:25,212 --> 00:01:27,302
Our clan only has Nin, Luna,

39
00:01:27,302 --> 00:01:29,089
Manicia, and me, after all.

40
00:01:29,899 --> 00:01:33,893
If only you had something
you could show them right away.

41
00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:36,999
Lily.

42
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:41,603
Something we can
show the others right now, huh?

43
00:01:42,206 --> 00:01:44,007
Only our combat strength, I think.

44
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:46,099
However,

45
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,399
doing so might reveal
that we're protecting Marius.

46
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,288
So, we can only tell them
we've repelled the guardian.

47
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:53,392
You have a point.

48
00:01:53,902 --> 00:01:54,890
Seems like

49
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,494
we really need someone to guide us
on how to manage a clan.

50
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,098
But after listening to Lilia's advice,

51
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:02,716
I've been doing my best
to put in the effort.

52
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:06,902
You truly live up to being a clan leader.

53
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:08,695
How dependable.

54
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:09,899
At this rate,

55
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,404
we might just end up
becoming a large clan soon.

56
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:14,509
You don't sound too happy about that.

57
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,196
Well, if that happens,

58
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,294
we won't get

59
00:02:20,294 --> 00:02:23,189
to spend as much time
alone together anymore.

60
00:02:33,592 --> 00:02:34,600
Rud.

61
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,703
If you can't find any allies of helpers,

62
00:02:41,603 --> 00:02:44,697
you can use my identity for publicity.

63
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,907
I can't do that.

64
00:02:46,907 --> 00:02:47,907
You dislike that.

65
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,296
Rud, you really are…

66
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:55,801
Rud, become the manager of the labyrinth!

67
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,803
What are you doing?

68
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:58,700
Nothing.

69
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,507
Didn't I already refuse?

70
00:03:01,508 --> 00:03:03,193
I'm quite busy now.

71
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:05,615
Then I'll join your clan

72
00:03:05,616 --> 00:03:06,802
and help you stop the fights.

73
00:03:06,803 --> 00:03:09,105
That's not all you do in a clan.

74
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,000
By the way,

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,499
is it all right for the guardian
to be wandering around like this?

76
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,207
Not a problem at all.

77
00:03:13,906 --> 00:03:14,611
Then,

78
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:16,300
do you harbour any…

79
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:17,698
resentment towards humans?

80
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,406
Are you really asking that?

81
00:03:21,406 --> 00:03:22,499
So, he does.

82
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,770
Looks like he has a story to tell.

83
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,095
Not even the slightest.

84
00:03:27,096 --> 00:03:28,603
So, let me help you.

85
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:30,804
And, in turn,
you help me manage the labyrinth.

86
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,213
Fine.

87
00:03:34,012 --> 00:03:35,799
I'll let you join the clan.

88
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:39,104
Explain the labyrinth management again.

89
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,498
Let's get going then.

90
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,293
I haven't agreed
to become the manager, though.

91
00:04:00,096 --> 00:04:03,663
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

92
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:09,867
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

93
00:05:30,303 --> 00:05:31,599
Rud, come.

94
00:05:34,104 --> 00:05:35,901
Do you usually manage
the labyrinth from here?

95
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:36,806
That's right.

96
00:05:38,194 --> 00:05:40,490
This pool reflects
the internal conditions of the labyrinth.

97
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:45,245
You also adjust the monster configuration
and labyrinth structure here.

98
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,113
See the points?

99
00:05:49,114 --> 00:05:51,002
You can create or replicate monsters

100
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:53,805
just by using points.

101
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:56,718
Do these points automatically increase?

102
00:05:57,403 --> 00:06:00,794
Points increase over time

103
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,113
or by depleting
an adventurer's shield force.

104
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,795
I see.

105
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:06,600
So, for example,

106
00:06:06,601 --> 00:06:08,299
if you deplete an amount
of my shield force,

107
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,005
you can recover
an equivalent amount of points?

108
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:12,105
Oh, you can do that?

109
00:06:12,601 --> 00:06:14,095
Can you demonstrate it to me?

110
00:06:14,697 --> 00:06:15,709
Sure.

111
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,601
Are you cloning a Goblin?

112
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,218
I'm summoning it into the labyrinth.

113
00:06:24,104 --> 00:06:26,806
-Hey, that will scare off the adventurers.
-Ow…

114
00:06:28,006 --> 00:06:30,603
Can you clone other monsters
besides Goblins?

115
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,394
Yes.

116
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:34,310
The only ones we can currently clone are…

117
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,399
Goblins,

118
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,810
Axe Orcs,

119
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:38,102
Chameleon Kongs,

120
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:40,400
and Fieldsauruses.

121
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,639
Only monsters created
through "Creation" can be cloned.

122
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,201
By the way,

123
00:06:47,202 --> 00:06:49,512
if you can establish
a trust relationship with a monster,

124
00:06:49,513 --> 00:06:52,298
they might help you in dire situations

125
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,508
and even become quite fond of you.

126
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:56,499
Will monsters really bond with humans?

127
00:06:57,707 --> 00:07:00,018
It costs a million points?

128
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:01,489
It's impossible to create new monsters.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,504
That's right.

130
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,514
That's where the grimoire comes in.

131
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:08,910
It's an item that can let you
randomly create monsters.

132
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,202
It's like a lottery.

133
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,806
Want to try it?

134
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:19,793
APPEARS

135
00:07:19,793 --> 00:07:20,793
Slime?

136
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:25,194
It's a little different
from what I explained,

137
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,696
but it grew attached to you quite quickly.

138
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:30,698
Does this mean we can create Slimes now?

139
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:31,699
Correct.

140
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,802
That means

141
00:07:32,803 --> 00:07:34,200
with time,

142
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,206
we may be able to create S-rank monsters.

143
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:40,793
Adventurers to Avancier

144
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,587
mostly come for the Fieldsauruses.

145
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:45,403
While they're popular now,

146
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:46,994
the flow of people will likely decrease

147
00:07:46,994 --> 00:07:48,694
once their drop is
readily available everywhere.

148
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:50,795
If I become one of the managers,

149
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:53,304
I can add various types of monsters
into the labyrinth

150
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:56,401
to stabilise the flow of adventurers.

151
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,704
This…

152
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,602
could also be applied
to managing the clan.

153
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:08,998
The hit just now recovered 1000 points.

154
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:09,998
Hey, Rud!

155
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:11,897
I think that little guy's a Rare Slime!

156
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:14,697
Creating such a powerful creature.
You really struck gold!

157
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,895
Thank you, Slime.

158
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:20,092
Thanks to you, I've got a great idea.

159
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:21,701
Marius,

160
00:08:22,893 --> 00:08:26,199
I'll manage the labyrinth in your stead.

161
00:08:26,764 --> 00:08:27,798
Really?

162
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,009
Not right away.

163
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,469
But I'll think carefully about
what kind of labyrinth I want to create

164
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,299
to attract adventurers.

165
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:37,815
Can I trouble you to manage it
for a while longer?

166
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:39,392
I'll accept that.

167
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,600
What should we do about this little guy?

168
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,897
It doesn't like me at all.

169
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:46,410
You should take it with you.

170
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:51,203
Slime?

171
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:53,201
It's okay, Luna.

172
00:08:53,202 --> 00:08:55,895
Well, um, I ended up
with this little thing somehow.

173
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,595
And Manicia's always wanted a pet…

174
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:06,700
It looks cuter
than the other Slimes out there.

175
00:09:08,206 --> 00:09:09,206
Aw, so cute.

176
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,301
Big Brother,

177
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,206
if we're keeping it,

178
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:15,606
we should give it a name.

179
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:16,704
You're right.

180
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,501
Master,

181
00:09:18,501 --> 00:09:21,511
you came up with my name
almost immediately.

182
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:23,313
You didn't…

183
00:09:23,997 --> 00:09:25,500
just pick a name, did you?

184
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,894
No, I didn't!

185
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:28,799
I thought it over

186
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:30,196
and came up with a cute name.

187
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:31,106
I think you said it was because

188
00:09:31,106 --> 00:09:34,502
a Lunafia petal fell on Miss Luna.

189
00:09:35,099 --> 00:09:36,701
That was surprisingly spontaneous of you.

190
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,310
R… Right.

191
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:40,394
How do you feel about the name "Lime"?

192
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:43,166
I think it likes it.

193
00:09:43,685 --> 00:09:45,098
That's great.

194
00:09:45,099 --> 00:09:46,795
Nice to meet you, Lime.

195
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:51,796
I love seeing you flustered.

196
00:09:51,796 --> 00:09:52,802
Me too.

197
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,806
Give me a break…

198
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:03,606
Avancier's clan leader?

199
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:06,672
Why would we form an alliance
with a clan from such a rural town?

200
00:10:07,697 --> 00:10:09,098
Bu, reject them.

201
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:11,027
No, wait.

202
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:15,702
This kid seems interesting.

203
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:17,504
Very well.

204
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:19,936
In a few days, the two major clans
will be holding a ball.

205
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:22,513
-Invite them.
-Invite them to join us.

206
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,000
Days later,

207
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,895
we found ourselves in Caird.

208
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:33,202
This town's bigger than I imagined.

209
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,710
Lilia, Lily,

210
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:37,011
thank you for coming along.

211
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,307
Don't mention it.

212
00:10:38,308 --> 00:10:40,307
We can stop by the guild here too.

213
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,101
It's my first time attending a ball.

214
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,907
How exciting, Lilia.

215
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:48,896
Rud, what does that flag represent?

216
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,101
It's the same pattern
as the one printed here.

217
00:10:51,102 --> 00:10:54,103
Those are the flags of
Black Dragon Fang and White Tiger Claw.

218
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:57,397
Those flags are everywhere.

219
00:11:00,895 --> 00:11:02,203
Everyone's here, yes?

220
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,997
Take a look at this.

221
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,099
It's the invitation to a ball

222
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,790
from the two major clans of Caird,
Black Dragon Fang and White Tiger Claw.

223
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,311
Isn't it great
that you got an invitation, Big Brother?

224
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:14,704
Though I'm not entirely clear,

225
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:15,790
Master is indeed quite formidable.

226
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,209
Look.

227
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,308
I doubt they're interested
in being chummy.

228
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:23,308
What conditions did they propose?

229
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:25,903
You're right.

230
00:11:25,904 --> 00:11:27,600
They rejected the alliance proposal.

231
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:30,596
However, they said they might consider
letting us become their subsidiary.

232
00:11:31,283 --> 00:11:32,797
I knew it.

233
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:34,884
That's not all.

234
00:11:36,413 --> 00:11:37,797
In return for their help,

235
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,998
they want Nin.

236
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:40,808
Nin?

237
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:43,509
Nin is a renowned saint.

238
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,598
It's not just the two clans.
Others have brought it up before as well.

239
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,403
But most of them came for Nin.

240
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,710
I'm in high demand, after all.

241
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,702
So, what are you going to do?

242
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,211
Are you going to hand me over?

243
00:11:59,107 --> 00:12:01,712
If you want to go, I won't stop you.

244
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:04,006
What if I ask you not to give me up,
no matter what?

245
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:06,097
Then I'll turn them down.

246
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,189
Then reject them.

247
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,312
I don't plan on affiliating myself
with any other clan.

248
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:17,797
I understand.

249
00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:19,301
I'll turn them down no matter what.

250
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:23,994
But

251
00:12:23,995 --> 00:12:26,106
I am prepared to attend the ball,

252
00:12:26,106 --> 00:12:27,393
knowing the lurking dangers.

253
00:12:28,795 --> 00:12:30,499
The guests will likely belong

254
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,807
to either Black Dragon Fang
or White Tiger Claw.

255
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,711
I cannot pass up this opportunity

256
00:12:35,712 --> 00:12:39,089
to speak directly to the leaders
of the two major clans.

257
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:40,698
You're right.

258
00:12:40,699 --> 00:12:42,499
Now is not the time to retreat.
It's time to take the initiative.

259
00:12:43,606 --> 00:12:46,795
Caird…

260
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:47,600
What's wrong?

261
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:50,495
Nothing,
just remembered something unimportant.

262
00:12:51,007 --> 00:12:52,719
I once saw a labyrinth

263
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:55,798
with a sentient guardian just like me
in that pond.

264
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:58,592
And the labyrinth's name is the same
as the town called Caird,

265
00:12:58,593 --> 00:12:59,988
"Caird Labyrinth."

266
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:04,309
That's important information!

267
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,493
Is that so?

268
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:07,392
In other words,

269
00:13:07,393 --> 00:13:09,199
if we can conquer Caird Labyrinth

270
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,308
and obtain another magic stone,

271
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,211
perhaps Manicia's illness
can be completely cured.

272
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,210
Caird Labyrinth.

273
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,602
I heard that the two major clans

274
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:23,004
only ever managed
to break through to the 50th floor.

275
00:13:23,891 --> 00:13:26,013
But we've grown a lot during this time.

276
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,993
Not only do we have Marius
with impeccable fire power,

277
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:32,793
but also Luna, who practices magic
whenever she has free time,

278
00:13:32,793 --> 00:13:34,305
and the excellent healer Nin.

279
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,699
I think we should be able
to form a great party.

280
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:39,695
Raid the labyrinth and find an alliance.

281
00:13:40,292 --> 00:13:42,489
It looks like we're going
to have a very interesting trip.

282
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:45,992
I'm sure neither will be easy to achieve.

283
00:13:47,002 --> 00:13:49,400
But I must form an alliance with them

284
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:51,497
and obtain the labyrinth treasure.

285
00:13:57,595 --> 00:13:58,698
Sorry to keep you waiting.

286
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:02,008
Well? Doesn't it suit me?

287
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,192
It does.

288
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:07,494
I did try to get Luna
to wear a dress like me.

289
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:11,893
I… I think I look better in this.

290
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:17,003
You'd look beautiful in a dress, too,

291
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:18,993
but the maid outfit suits you.

292
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,593
Thank... Thank you.

293
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,606
Lilia, you need to walk
with your head held high.

294
00:14:26,193 --> 00:14:28,399
These girly clothes

295
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,898
are really not for me.

296
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,600
Don't worry, you look adorable.

297
00:14:37,695 --> 00:14:39,502
Don't keep staring at me.

298
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,385
Lilia is shy.

299
00:14:40,385 --> 00:14:41,796
Stop that.

300
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,598
This is a fancy ball.

301
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:47,590
This all belongs
to Black Dragon Fang, after all.

302
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:48,795
It really opens your eye.

303
00:14:49,372 --> 00:14:53,601
I heard White Tiger Claw
has similar establishments.

304
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,292
Truly the clans
that rule above others, huh?

305
00:15:00,504 --> 00:15:02,200
Isn't that Saint Nin?

306
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,803
It is her.

307
00:15:03,804 --> 00:15:05,488
Why is she attending our clan's ball?

308
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,804
Didn't you know?

309
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:11,102
Rumour has it that Saint Nin's clan
is becoming a subsidiary of ours.

310
00:15:12,503 --> 00:15:13,804
Where did that come from?

311
00:15:13,804 --> 00:15:14,604
And they make it sound

312
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:17,099
like Nin's the leader of our clan.

313
00:15:17,099 --> 00:15:18,289
Leader,

314
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:19,999
you can't let them look down on us.

315
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:22,705
Show them what we're made of.

316
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,394
That was the plan.

317
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,902
I had prepared myself for this,

318
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:29,585
but it is really uncomfortable here…

319
00:15:30,302 --> 00:15:31,302
Rud!

320
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,310
Can I eat the food over there?

321
00:15:34,311 --> 00:15:35,691
Yes.

322
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:36,686
Got it.

323
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:40,481
Marius's really good
at easing the tension.

324
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,812
Yes, we should get some food too.

325
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:50,495
Thank you all
for attending tonight's ball.

326
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:54,410
I am Ike,
the subleader of Black Dragon Fang.

327
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,495
I am Cynthia,
the subleader of White Tiger Claw.

328
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,794
I thought the leaders of both clans
would be present.

329
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:05,596
We have invited a special guest.

330
00:16:06,993 --> 00:16:07,899
Saint Nin,

331
00:16:08,602 --> 00:16:10,606
may we invite you to come on stage?

332
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:13,889
Rud,

333
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:16,805
those guys are calling me.

334
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,599
But I am Nin from your clan.

335
00:16:21,005 --> 00:16:21,901
Yes.

336
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,401
I'll go and correct them.

337
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,787
Can you come up with me?

338
00:16:31,103 --> 00:16:32,196
Saint Nin,

339
00:16:32,196 --> 00:16:34,999
I didn't expect you
to officially become an adventurer.

340
00:16:34,999 --> 00:16:36,194
It's truly a surprise.

341
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:37,797
Is that so?

342
00:16:37,798 --> 00:16:40,900
I've always wanted
to focus on being an adventurer.

343
00:16:41,703 --> 00:16:43,606
May I ask who the man next to you is?

344
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,504
Who is that guy?

345
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,998
He's too close to the saint.

346
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,197
He is…

347
00:16:48,197 --> 00:16:49,102
Nice to meet you.

348
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:53,298
I am Rud,
the leader of the clan Nin belongs to.

349
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:59,208
Aren't you the man
who used to be part of the hero's party?

350
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,505
I remember your class

351
00:17:01,506 --> 00:17:02,802
was a tank, right?

352
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:06,901
The former hero even
said you were useless.

353
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,094
He consulted me

354
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,500
on his party formation issues

355
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,398
many times.

356
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:17,407
So I suggested he just kick out the tank.

357
00:17:17,816 --> 00:17:18,591
What?

358
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,111
Raiding the labyrinth
doesn't require a tank.

359
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,800
You say it doesn't need a tank?

360
00:17:26,801 --> 00:17:27,801
That's right.

361
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:30,590
The tank is supposed to protect
the party from attacks,

362
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,702
but in reality, they serve no purpose.

363
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,002
Exactly.

364
00:17:34,003 --> 00:17:35,000
-Attackers can
-If you must have one,

365
00:17:35,001 --> 00:17:35,997
-replace the tanks.
-just opt for an evasive-type tank.

366
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,200
I will cut straight to the point.
Saint Nin,

367
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,310
won't you join our clan?

368
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:43,800
Staying in a no-name clan

369
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,902
will only hide your true potential.

370
00:17:44,903 --> 00:17:46,107
Hold on!

371
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:48,703
We need an excellent healer

372
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:50,486
to conquer the Caird Labyrinth too.

373
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,404
Enough.

374
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:54,095
I have no intention of handing over Nin.

375
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:56,998
Mister Rud.

376
00:17:56,999 --> 00:18:00,289
Aren't you looking for a clan advisor?

377
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:03,704
But you wanted Nin in exchange.

378
00:18:04,903 --> 00:18:06,801
I'm sorry, but Nin is an important ally.

379
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:09,604
I wouldn't trade her for anything.

380
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,498
So, why are you here?

381
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,509
I want to form an alliance with you.

382
00:18:14,099 --> 00:18:15,000
An alliance?

383
00:18:15,001 --> 00:18:16,888
Is he suggesting an alliance
with our clan?

384
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:18,992
Isn't he from some weak clan
in the countryside?

385
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:20,997
And he's just a tank.

386
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:22,394
This has to be a joke.

387
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,652
Just knowing a tank is the clan leader

388
00:18:25,652 --> 00:18:26,999
is unsettling.

389
00:18:27,885 --> 00:18:28,690
Saint Nin,

390
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,002
do you really want to be
around a man like this?

391
00:18:32,408 --> 00:18:34,099
Yes, of course.

392
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,409
Because he's the strongest tank
in the world!

393
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:46,503
May I borrow the mic?

394
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:53,508
We came here to conquer Caird Labyrinth.

395
00:18:54,402 --> 00:18:56,593
We're better than everyone in this room.

396
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,106
You can laugh all you want.

397
00:18:58,998 --> 00:18:59,701
But

398
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,807
those who laugh now will regret it later.

399
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,398
We will surpass your expectations.

400
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:07,408
We will conquer the Caird Labyrinth
up to the 51st floor,

401
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:10,299
a feat neither of
the two major clans have achieved.

402
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:12,310
We

403
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:13,699
will achieve our goal.

404
00:19:17,899 --> 00:19:19,899
That's a good spirited young man.

405
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:22,703
I like people like that.

406
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,793
Leader…

407
00:19:25,405 --> 00:19:26,494
You came.

408
00:19:27,095 --> 00:19:27,908
Yes.

409
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,695
Ike, I've told you
not to underestimate newcomers.

410
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:33,089
That's a bad habit of yours.

411
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:34,411
But…

412
00:19:34,412 --> 00:19:36,099
Rud, was it?

413
00:19:37,214 --> 00:19:40,496
I am Gothew,
the leader of Black Dragon Fang.

414
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,264
It's a pleasure to meet you.

415
00:19:42,895 --> 00:19:43,704
The pleasure is mine.

416
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:46,512
Just by shaking hands,

417
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,115
you can tell he's
got extraordinary strength.

418
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:53,217
So this is the leader
of Black Dragon Fang.

419
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,803
If this guy can conquer the labyrinth,

420
00:19:57,803 --> 00:20:00,282
then I'll consider an alliance with them.

421
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,907
Stop hiding and say something.

422
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:04,508
Goodness.

423
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:06,907
I was going to pretend I wasn't around.

424
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:08,892
Don't say that,

425
00:20:08,892 --> 00:20:11,107
Miss Ryutel,
the leader of White Tiger Claw.

426
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:15,298
If this clan can conquer the labyrinth,

427
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,493
I might consider
the possibility of an alliance.

428
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,188
The condition being that you first
successfully conquer the labyrinth.

429
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,600
That's what she said, Rud.

430
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,010
Show us you're not all bluff.

431
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,107
That was a great speech!

432
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,495
Please let that go.

433
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:36,135
By the way,

434
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:39,305
why don't people know how strong you are?

435
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:41,907
Because generally speaking,
you can't tell with just the eyes.

436
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,785
No… anyone with a certain level
of strength can tell.

437
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,205
That you're not an ordinary person.

438
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,805
Rud, you must conquer the labyrinth.

439
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:55,004
I don't like seeing you
being treated as a joke.

440
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:57,423
Well then, I'm off to take a bath.

441
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:00,904
Don't give anyone any trouble.

442
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:02,303
I know.

443
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:04,055
Master.

444
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,391
You look tired.

445
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,003
It's not often I get to speak
in front of so many people.

446
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,203
But

447
00:21:13,204 --> 00:21:15,307
you were very impressive just now, Master.

448
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,200
I was very happy to hear it.

449
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:18,414
Indeed.

450
00:21:18,414 --> 00:21:20,779
And, well…

451
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,405
Thank you

452
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:26,194
for standing up for me.

453
00:21:26,195 --> 00:21:27,601
That made me really happy.

454
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,113
Of course.

455
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:30,786
You're my important comrade.

456
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,706
Anyway, I just wanted to thank you.

457
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:36,893
See you tomorrow.

458
00:21:39,302 --> 00:21:42,100
The labyrinth that even
the two major clans couldn't conquer.

459
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,109
It won't be easy,

460
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,091
but to protect my clan and friends,

461
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,605
I must

462
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,803
conquer Caird Labyrinth.
