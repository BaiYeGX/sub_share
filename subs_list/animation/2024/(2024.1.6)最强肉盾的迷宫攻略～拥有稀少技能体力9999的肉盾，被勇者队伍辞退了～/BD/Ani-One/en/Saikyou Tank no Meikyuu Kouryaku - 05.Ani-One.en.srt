1
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:10,303
If I can stand in for Master
and protect this town,

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,012
I'll do it.

3
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:15,899
With the encouragement of my companions,

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,200
I've decided to save Manicia

5
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:19,094
and protect this town.

6
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:21,902
To realise these objectives,

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,904
I must successfully raid the labyrinth.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,103
After that,
I immediately prepared to establish a clan.

9
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:31,806
However, I was summoned by
the investigators of Avancier's labyrinth,

10
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:37,799
only to find out that those investigators
were members of my former party.

11
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:46,498
So, let me reintroduce myself.

12
00:00:48,093 --> 00:00:49,710
I'm Lilia.

13
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:51,217
I believe this is the first time
we've met since you were kicked out,

14
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:51,999
Rud.

15
00:00:52,697 --> 00:00:54,503
I'm the younger of the twins, Lily.

16
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:57,201
Although we're twins,

17
00:00:57,202 --> 00:00:59,195
our eye colours are different
due to our unique constitution.

18
00:00:59,196 --> 00:01:00,304
They're really close.

19
00:01:01,392 --> 00:01:03,497
Thank you for all your hard work.

20
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:06,806
I'm Shugor, the knight of the church.

21
00:01:07,707 --> 00:01:09,194
I... I am Luna.

22
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,695
It's nice to meet you.

23
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,300
Well, let's discuss the details inside.

24
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:19,398
Yo.

25
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,707
Long time no see, Rud.

26
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,086
Kygras!

27
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:27,008
How dare you summon us!

28
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,993
After everything you did to Rud!

29
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,600
Thank you,

30
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:34,094
but I've put that behind me.

31
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:36,116
Kygras,

32
00:01:36,902 --> 00:01:38,111
tell me why we're here.

33
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:40,291
I'm sure you didn't call us here

34
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:41,410
just to say hello.

35
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,405
Yesterday,

36
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:49,594
we encountered a sentient guardian
during our investigation.

37
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:51,700
A sentient guardian?

38
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:56,001
Of all the labyrinth guardians
we've fought up until now,

39
00:01:56,002 --> 00:01:58,105
even if capable of taking on human forms,

40
00:01:58,106 --> 00:01:59,702
were incapable of speech.

41
00:02:03,405 --> 00:02:04,708
You've seen what a miserable state I'm in,

42
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,305
so...

43
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:09,503
you go in and investigate for me.

44
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:13,809
I'm just trying to finish the quest
I've been putting off.

45
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,202
Don't complain. Just do it.

46
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:16,998
In short,

47
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:19,310
having you investigate
the labyrinth in his place

48
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:20,915
is this guy's way of apologising.

49
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,601
Don't say that!

50
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,094
What, are you shy?

51
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:24,904
I'm not!

52
00:02:25,597 --> 00:02:26,603
Ugh, seriously.

53
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,797
To cure your sister,

54
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:31,998
don't you need the labyrinth's treasure?

55
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:33,102
You remember that?

56
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:36,701
I... know the reason

57
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:39,912
I've been able to successfully raid

58
00:02:41,806 --> 00:02:42,904
the labyrinths up until now.

59
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:46,208
So, what's your decision?

60
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,315
Are you going to do it or not?

61
00:02:51,089 --> 00:02:52,105
Please let me investigate it.

62
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:02,095
In that case,
I'll be borrowing Lilia and the others.

63
00:03:03,198 --> 00:03:03,906
Rud,

64
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:07,100
I'm sorry about everything.

65
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:11,604
Don't die.

66
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:14,306
Thanks.

67
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,900
I will defeat the guardian.

68
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:33,344
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

69
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:39,806
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

70
00:04:51,493 --> 00:04:53,506
I didn't expect Kygras to say all of that.

71
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:54,196
But

72
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:56,189
it's great to have a full party.

73
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:56,999
Yes.

74
00:04:57,807 --> 00:04:59,899
Let's raid Avancier's labyrinth.

75
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:15,403
This is…

76
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:17,901
We'll be teleporting to the first floor
of the labyrinth from here.

77
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,606
Let's go.

78
00:05:31,406 --> 00:05:32,899
I had no idea it would be so spacious

79
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,499
inside the labyrinth.

80
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:37,394
You can even see the sun.

81
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,215
Just a reminder, that sun won't move.

82
00:05:40,216 --> 00:05:42,206
So, be careful not to let the labyrinth
distort your sense of time,

83
00:05:43,902 --> 00:05:46,198
as the space inside is warped.

84
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,007
Many things that are impossible in reality
can happen here.

85
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,005
The magic circle disappeared.

86
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,396
Doesn't that mean we can't go back?

87
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,804
That's right.

88
00:05:56,805 --> 00:05:57,702
If we want to go back,

89
00:05:57,703 --> 00:06:00,402
we'll have to find another magic circle.

90
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:02,399
"TEACH US, MISS NIN!"
But don't worry about it.

91
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,006
Lily has a skill called "Dungeon Walk."

92
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:07,706
Normally,

93
00:06:07,707 --> 00:06:09,392
to move between floors,

94
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:13,314
you have to locate
the randomly configured magic circles.

95
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:15,798
"DUNGEON WALK"
However, with "Dungeon Walk",

96
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:18,106
you can move freely
between floors you've been to.

97
00:06:19,807 --> 00:06:23,902
But the skill only allows
for a maximum of six.

98
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:26,094
So, only a maximum of six people
can be teleported at the same time.

99
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:29,098
There are other magic spells
similar to "Dungeon Walk" as well.

100
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:30,906
Nin, show it to Luna.

101
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,399
Got it.

102
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:37,205
This is an emergency escape spell.

103
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:38,206
Let me try it.

104
00:06:42,491 --> 00:06:44,401
She learned it in an instant.

105
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:45,294
Impressive.

106
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:49,402
That was most likely the ability

107
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:51,815
of a combat-type Homunculus.

108
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:56,708
Three Chameleon Kongs approaching.

109
00:07:00,395 --> 00:07:01,893
Lilia and Shugor, take the front.

110
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:04,104
Nin and Lily will be in the rearguard.

111
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:05,193
Please handle support and healing.

112
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:08,199
Luna will move around
and protect the party.

113
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
And I, as always,

114
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:12,095
will be the tank.

115
00:07:14,003 --> 00:07:15,102
"Taunt"!

116
00:07:37,293 --> 00:07:38,708
Let's defeat them with this momentum!

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,802
All right!

118
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:46,093
This party is good.

119
00:07:53,997 --> 00:07:56,705
This is where
the guardian appeared last time.

120
00:07:57,601 --> 00:07:58,511
Not this time, though.

121
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:01,893
Fieldsauruses!

122
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:05,395
They are faster
than they are in other labyrinths.

123
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:07,500
Is this the work of the guardian here?

124
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:10,795
I'll handle these guys.

125
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:13,906
You guys find the magic circle.

126
00:08:14,407 --> 00:08:15,299
Got it.

127
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:16,705
"Taunt"!

128
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:25,101
Remember to conserve strength
for the guardian battle.

129
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:31,102
Found the magic circle.

130
00:08:31,493 --> 00:08:33,097
Great. Let's progress.

131
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:36,304
Clear judgment.

132
00:08:39,498 --> 00:08:40,604
Seventh floor.

133
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,295
Eighth floor.

134
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,900
Ninth floor.

135
00:08:47,197 --> 00:08:50,105
Hurry up and come to me.

136
00:08:53,206 --> 00:08:55,299
The next floor is finally the tenth floor.

137
00:08:58,992 --> 00:08:59,701
Everyone,

138
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:04,714
thank you for going along
with my selfish request.

139
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,700
What's with this all of a sudden?

140
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,204
No need to be so polite.

141
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:12,009
You're doing this
for your sister, aren't you?

142
00:09:12,608 --> 00:09:14,802
I understand how important
your family is to you.

143
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,500
That's right…

144
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:20,298
It's too soon to say "thank you",

145
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:24,403
Rud.

146
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,000
This is where the challenge begins.

147
00:09:33,502 --> 00:09:34,099
Right.

148
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,000
Let's defeat the guardian together.

149
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:51,796
It's an entire grassland.

150
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,088
That was

151
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:57,789
a splendid performance.

152
00:09:58,807 --> 00:09:59,708
This guy…

153
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:04,798
I never expected
such powerful adventurers.

154
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,424
is the sentient guardian.

155
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:09,401
Welcome

156
00:10:09,903 --> 00:10:11,295
to my labyrinth.

157
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:17,596
I am the guardian of this labyrinth,

158
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,011
Marius.

159
00:10:26,402 --> 00:10:28,999
I heard the guardian
was supposed to be on the fifth floor.

160
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,889
Well, considering my formidable opponents,
I figured I should wait for you

161
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,493
on the tenth floor,
where I can unleash my abilities.

162
00:10:38,607 --> 00:10:41,305
This floor is my domain.

163
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:42,798
Anyway,

164
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,994
you'll soon find out

165
00:10:44,995 --> 00:10:46,300
what I'm capable of.

166
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,496
What's with this power?

167
00:10:53,497 --> 00:10:54,701
My arm feels like it's about to break.

168
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:58,005
It's impressive
that you could block that attack.

169
00:10:58,005 --> 00:10:59,393
It seems waiting was worthwhile.

170
00:11:00,105 --> 00:11:00,909
Marius,

171
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,404
I didn't come here to fight you.

172
00:11:03,405 --> 00:11:04,099
Let's talk...

173
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,797
Exchanging blows with blades

174
00:11:07,495 --> 00:11:11,300
is the way men converse.

175
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:14,600
He'll take us out
the second we let our guard down.

176
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,300
Leave the negotiations for later.

177
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:17,997
Prepare for battle!

178
00:11:18,713 --> 00:11:19,600
Here we go!

179
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:22,021
Not bad.

180
00:11:31,103 --> 00:11:32,100
What's with this guy?

181
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,693
Does he have eyes on his back?

182
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,194
Excellent teamwork.

183
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:39,996
Looks like I'll have to get serious.

184
00:11:40,602 --> 00:11:44,108
Once I reveal my true abilities,
I'll turn into a complete monster.

185
00:11:44,108 --> 00:11:47,711
If you don't want to die,
use your skills to escape.

186
00:11:48,194 --> 00:11:51,094
Let's see if you can defeat me.

187
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:01,590
What's this guy's deal?

188
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,405
You can tell how dangerous he is

189
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:05,308
just by the sound of his roar.

190
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:06,700
But

191
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,591
I can't back down.

192
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:13,304
I'll just have to defeat him.

193
00:12:15,303 --> 00:12:16,994
Such a heavy blow.

194
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,701
Lilia, get on my wind.

195
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:25,606
All right.

196
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:31,796
Mister Rud,

197
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:33,712
let's take turns
drawing the enemy's attention.

198
00:12:33,713 --> 00:12:34,496
I'm counting on you.

199
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:36,493
Magic. "Taunt".

200
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:44,499
I had an idea how powerful he might be.

201
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:47,791
But one more blow like this

202
00:12:47,792 --> 00:12:49,894
could be fatal.

203
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:52,398
Don't take his attacks head-on.

204
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,593
That's something

205
00:12:53,594 --> 00:12:55,101
only you can do, Mister Rud.

206
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:58,506
Nin, focus on healing.

207
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:01,489
Lily, use support magic
to maintain the vanguard's strength.

208
00:13:02,192 --> 00:13:03,001
Luna, cover us.

209
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:04,297
Understood.

210
00:13:05,096 --> 00:13:06,001
Shugor,

211
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,201
let me take over.

212
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,201
"Taunt!"

213
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:13,695
It's going to be a long fight.

214
00:13:14,908 --> 00:13:16,589
Then it's a battle of stamina.

215
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:17,702
Is that okay?

216
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,096
It might not be favourable
for a typical party,

217
00:13:20,492 --> 00:13:21,393
but

218
00:13:21,394 --> 00:13:23,094
we have Rud.

219
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,096
With "Sacrificial Shield,"
we can channel all the damage

220
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,306
we received onto Rud.

221
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:30,294
The shield force worn down
in the prolonged battle

222
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:33,506
can unleash tremendous power
through "Life Conversion".

223
00:13:34,806 --> 00:13:37,196
If we put everything
into that one strike,

224
00:13:37,197 --> 00:13:38,998
we can get through
this battle of endurance.

225
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:48,203
Lady Lilia!

226
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:50,106
At this rate,

227
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:51,998
someone will go down.

228
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,794
Luna.

229
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:55,698
As the rearguard,

230
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:56,794
it's hard to watch your comrades suffer.

231
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:58,189
But

232
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,698
so long as we still stand,
so will our vanguard.

233
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,799
So, remember this.

234
00:14:03,902 --> 00:14:07,096
We must hold our ground and stand firm.

235
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:12,500
I understand.

236
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:19,507
He is slowing down.

237
00:14:19,508 --> 00:14:20,795
Is he getting tired?

238
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,096
We've currently used up
30,000 shield force points.

239
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,400
If I hit him with the attack now...

240
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:32,495
Master!

241
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:34,798
Luna!

242
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,104
I can't let this opportunity slip away.

243
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,305
Let's finish this battle with this blow!

244
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:40,400
"Life Conversion"!

245
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:49,305
Did we get him?

246
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:55,602
No way! He's still moving!

247
00:14:58,506 --> 00:14:59,807
The attack was effective.

248
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:02,794
If we can use "Life Conversion" again…

249
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:23,998
Is everyone all right?

250
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:25,409
I'm fine.

251
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:27,096
Lily!

252
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:29,590
Are you all right?

253
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:32,790
I just need a moment…

254
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:39,697
Shugor!

255
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,399
I... I'm fine.

256
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:46,493
I can still fight.

257
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:54,204
Do I really want to endanger everyone

258
00:15:55,004 --> 00:15:56,796
for my own selfish desires?

259
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,207
I don't want everyone

260
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,290
to risk

261
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:05,281
their lives for me.

262
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:09,200
Emergency retreat.

263
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,102
Prepare to leave the labyrinth.

264
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:11,898
What are you saying?

265
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,493
I am the leader of this party.

266
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:16,695
I must make the right decision.

267
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:20,607
Rud.

268
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:23,902
We've all come this far.
Are you going to give up on your dreams?

269
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:25,405
Nin...

270
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:28,591
Didn't I tell you to do what you want,
and stop holding back?

271
00:16:29,306 --> 00:16:31,494
Mister Rud, please don't underestimate me.

272
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,604
Did you want to retreat
because you saw me struggle just now?

273
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,406
I came here prepared to fight,

274
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,504
even if it meant risking my life.

275
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:41,011
Rud!

276
00:16:41,898 --> 00:16:43,001
Things like running away...

277
00:16:44,205 --> 00:16:47,394
Don't give me such a lame speech!

278
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:51,502
I...

279
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,391
I want to save Manicia.

280
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,101
So... please,

281
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,102
lend me your strength!

282
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:03,108
Skill. "Fusion".

283
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:13,502
Fusion complete. Lilialy.

284
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:15,896
Lilialy.

285
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:17,389
Leave it to us.

286
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:23,396
Lilialy...

287
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,905
Shugor...

288
00:17:27,707 --> 00:17:29,099
Luna... Nin...

289
00:17:30,101 --> 00:17:31,092
This time…

290
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:34,804
Shugor's shield force broke!

291
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:37,197
"Life Conversion"!

292
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:44,701
If I take this blow,

293
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:47,108
my shield force will run out, too.

294
00:17:48,093 --> 00:17:49,311
But I will take it.

295
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,700
I'll turn every last damage

296
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:53,598
into power!

297
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,006
Get him!

298
00:17:57,693 --> 00:18:01,199
"Life Conversion"!

299
00:18:24,301 --> 00:18:26,204
I had fun, Rud.

300
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,795
I'm so tired I can't even move a finger.

301
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:32,403
Now, you can do whatever you want with me.

302
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:36,208
Is this the end?

303
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:37,500
Yes.

304
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:39,894
But

305
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:42,601
it won't be over
until you give me a final blow.

306
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:44,902
Didn't I say from the beginning?

307
00:18:44,903 --> 00:18:46,594
I came here to negotiate with you.

308
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:48,897
Marius,

309
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:54,095
do you have the labyrinth treasure
that can grant any wish?

310
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:56,704
What? Do you want this?

311
00:18:57,298 --> 00:18:58,107
Take it.

312
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:00,694
This is a magic stone
that can perform miracles.

313
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:04,301
Just hold the magic stone,
imbue it with magic, and make a wish.

314
00:19:05,004 --> 00:19:07,100
But it's only good for one wish.

315
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,208
So, use it wisely.

316
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,399
Is that all?

317
00:19:11,006 --> 00:19:11,898
Give me the final blow.

318
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,620
No, I want to avoid
the labyrinth disappearing

319
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,201
because there's a town nearby.

320
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:18,892
That's why,

321
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:21,204
Marius, I want you to continue

322
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:25,809
to be the guardian of the labyrinth
and oversee this place.

323
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:30,000
In other words,

324
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:31,893
you want to cooperate with me?

325
00:19:32,596 --> 00:19:34,999
I enjoy battling powerful individuals,

326
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
so

327
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,801
I'll gladly help.

328
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,502
And I hope to have the chance
to battle you again someday.

329
00:19:43,304 --> 00:19:45,997
About that... Maybe cut me some slack.

330
00:19:52,302 --> 00:19:54,604
Big Brother! How did you end up
battered and bruised all over?

331
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,199
I'm fine.

332
00:19:56,902 --> 00:19:58,198
Let's not dwell on that. This is for you.

333
00:19:59,412 --> 00:20:00,298
Please accept it.

334
00:20:01,305 --> 00:20:02,197
This is...

335
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:04,604
It's the magic stone
I've been searching for.

336
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:07,316
I can't accept it.

337
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:09,705
You should keep it for yourself.

338
00:20:10,694 --> 00:20:13,004
Even if I use it,
the result will be the same.

339
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:16,903
So...

340
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:18,492
Please use it.

341
00:20:22,003 --> 00:20:23,005
Big Brother...

342
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:26,805
I understand.

343
00:20:29,908 --> 00:20:31,994
O' magic stone that grants miracles,

344
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:35,905
please fulfil this long-standing wish

345
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,194
of mine...

346
00:20:45,303 --> 00:20:46,498
Any changes?

347
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:49,002
Manicia?

348
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:50,601
Though it's just a bit,

349
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:52,013
I don't feel as exhausted as before.

350
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,902
Before, if I moved like this,

351
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:56,599
I'd be out of breath in no time.

352
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:00,000
Now,

353
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,004
it feels like I can keep spinning forever.

354
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,998
It's the first time
I've seen Manicia like this.

355
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,792
So long as I keep adventuring,

356
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,701
one day, she will be completely cured.

357
00:21:15,602 --> 00:21:16,503
Big Brother...

358
00:21:17,803 --> 00:21:18,896
I've always worried

359
00:21:18,897 --> 00:21:21,296
that Manicia might suddenly
leave me one day.

360
00:21:23,295 --> 00:21:25,096
But it's going to be all right now...

361
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,486
Every effort I've made until this point

362
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,789
was not in vain.

363
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,288
Thank you,

364
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,294
Big Brother.

365
00:23:11,296 --> 00:23:12,308
Rud!

366
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:14,094
Marius?

367
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:15,014
What brings you here?

368
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,701
Congratulations.

369
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:18,901
Starting today,

370
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:20,313
you're the guardian of the labyrinth.

371
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,109
What?
