1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,095
To protect my clan and friends,

2
00:00:05,294 --> 00:00:06,402
I must

3
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:08,805
conquer Caird Labyrinth.

4
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:14,014
Rud.

5
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:15,896
Lily?

6
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:17,997
I have a favour to ask.

7
00:00:20,496 --> 00:00:21,700
Ow…

8
00:00:22,197 --> 00:00:23,392
What's the big deal?

9
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:44,647
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

10
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:50,890
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

11
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:07,890
Please help me
with the straps on the back.

12
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:14,604
There, all done.

13
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,597
Thank you.

14
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,296
Now I can give Lilia a surprise service.

15
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:25,500
I see. I'll leave you to it then.

16
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,105
Wait.

17
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:30,297
There's something else I want to ask you.

18
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,894
Rud, you…

19
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:37,305
You'll do your best

20
00:02:37,306 --> 00:02:39,102
as a clan leader, right?

21
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:40,316
Well, yes.

22
00:02:41,198 --> 00:02:43,303
You're amazing.

23
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:44,657
I thought so
when you made that declaration

24
00:02:44,658 --> 00:02:45,996
in front of everyone.

25
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:48,789
I'm a coward.

26
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,704
I can't even tell other people
the things I want to do.

27
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,299
Is there something you want to do?

28
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,198
Promise you won't laugh?

29
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:56,951
Promise.

30
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:01,198
I don't have any grand goals like you,

31
00:03:01,198 --> 00:03:01,906
but

32
00:03:01,907 --> 00:03:05,504
I don't want to let myself
rely on Lilia all the time.

33
00:03:05,504 --> 00:03:08,963
I want to be able to stand on my own.

34
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:11,496
When I'm with Lilia,

35
00:03:11,497 --> 00:03:13,408
I never have to worry about anything.

36
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,404
Growing up, I've always been clumsy.

37
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,586
I always mess things up.

38
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:21,299
But Lilia would always be there for me.

39
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,394
Lilia is perfect

40
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,201
and she can do anything.

41
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,701
She's a fierce fighter.

42
00:03:27,702 --> 00:03:31,203
And I can only support her from the rear.

43
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,516
Isn't that because you're good with magic?

44
00:03:34,517 --> 00:03:36,598
Lilia can use magic too,

45
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:38,597
but she fights close combat.

46
00:03:38,597 --> 00:03:40,697
And when we use "Fusion",

47
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:43,390
Lilia always takes control.

48
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:47,794
I've never fought on my own.

49
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,907
I see.

50
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:52,607
I always wondered

51
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,883
who took control when you guys fused.

52
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,311
But

53
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:57,691
I can't always depend on Lilia.

54
00:03:57,692 --> 00:04:01,016
I have things
I want to accomplish by myself.

55
00:04:01,603 --> 00:04:02,709
I see.

56
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,109
That's why she approached me.

57
00:04:06,093 --> 00:04:08,196
Given how close these sisters are,

58
00:04:08,197 --> 00:04:10,567
it is hard to tell the other
that they want to be independent.

59
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:16,203
Lily, you can trouble me.

60
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:19,407
Go ahead and go after what you want to do.

61
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:22,200
Really?

62
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,697
Then I'll get your help
the next time I want to do something…

63
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,491
Lily?

64
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:32,339
I thought I heard Rud…

65
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:38,111
Lilia.

66
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,801
-Rud…
-It's not what it looks like, Lilia!

67
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:43,851
You've got it all wrong!
This is a misunderstanding!

68
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:50,380
Can you come to the roof with me?

69
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:57,995
Is she going to push me off the roof?

70
00:04:57,995 --> 00:04:59,574
What are you afraid of?

71
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:02,099
Don't worry.

72
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:04,246
I'd have thrown him off
if it had been any other guy.

73
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:07,499
But you're not the kind of guy

74
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,695
that would ever hurt my precious sister.

75
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,599
That was just an act

76
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:16,258
to get you out here.

77
00:05:20,895 --> 00:05:23,703
Have I told you about our past?

78
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,409
You said you were abandoned
by your parents

79
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,092
and have been travelling
with only each other since.

80
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,596
Well,

81
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:32,590
rather than say we were abandoned,

82
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:35,398
it would be more accurate to say
we ran away

83
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,507
because we were being abused,

84
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,105
mostly by our father.

85
00:05:40,895 --> 00:05:43,105
So what happened earlier was a surprise.

86
00:05:43,106 --> 00:05:46,413
You're one of the few guys
she can communicate normally with.

87
00:05:49,806 --> 00:05:51,005
That's why

88
00:05:51,005 --> 00:05:53,670
I wanted to talk to you.

89
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,197
I want to take Lily

90
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:59,488
to a place where she can be happy.

91
00:06:02,003 --> 00:06:04,011
Until then, no matter what happens,

92
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:05,891
I swear to protect her.

93
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,004
I see.

94
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:10,407
You two are very considerate
of each other.

95
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:12,995
Lily told me

96
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:15,302
she thought you were perfect and amazing.

97
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,709
I'm not as good as she thinks I am.

98
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,884
Right.

99
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:22,402
I don't think you're perfect either.

100
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,601
You lose your cool

101
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:27,887
whenever your sister is involved.

102
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,200
I've always thought of you
as a bit of an oddball.

103
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:33,101
I don't want to hear that from you.

104
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,760
Thanks for hearing me out.

105
00:06:42,697 --> 00:06:44,691
You're my companion, after all.

106
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:46,093
You can tell me
if anything's bothering you.

107
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:50,618
I'll be counting on you
when the time comes.

108
00:06:55,904 --> 00:06:57,317
When's Lilia coming back?

109
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,208
Lilia, Lily, sorry to keep you waiting.

110
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:05,300
Not at all.

111
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,498
We just came back from the 49th floor.

112
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,103
"ADVENTURER AT THE ENTRANCE"
The 49th floor?

113
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:13,110
Yes.

114
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,810
"1ST FLOOR, 45TH FLOOR, 49TH FLOOR"
I had the adventurer

115
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,395
"1ST FLOOR, 45TH FLOOR, 49TH FLOOR"
take me there beforehand

116
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:21,000
so I could use my "Dungeon Walk"
to take everyone there directly.

117
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:23,026
You're a lifesaver, Lily.

118
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:24,005
Not at all.

119
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:24,898
Also,

120
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:26,796
the reason I didn't head straight
to the 50th floor

121
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,703
was to assess the monsters' spawn rate.

122
00:07:29,608 --> 00:07:31,704
I've gathered quite some intel
on my end too.

123
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:35,504
First, the party composition
of the two clans.

124
00:07:36,304 --> 00:07:37,806
Black Dragon Fang

125
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:40,209
uses four attackers
and two support and healers,

126
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,191
including the leader.

127
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,586
White Tiger Claw uses
four magic attackers

128
00:07:45,587 --> 00:07:47,108
and two healers.

129
00:07:47,109 --> 00:07:50,008
In other words,
both clans focus primarily on speed.

130
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:52,889
That's why they have
their attackers double as tanks.

131
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:55,196
Additionally, regardless of floor,

132
00:07:55,197 --> 00:07:57,991
it seems many of their members
were inflicted with abnormal statuses.

133
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,993
"STRONG BODY"
In that case, we can use

134
00:07:59,994 --> 00:08:01,898
my "Strong Body" to nullify
the abnormal statuses.

135
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:04,704
This is going to be
a challenging labyrinth,

136
00:08:05,707 --> 00:08:08,804
but no matter what,
we have to break through to the 51st floor

137
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,005
and form an alliance with the two clans.

138
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:13,014
All right.

139
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:16,993
I'll take the lead.

140
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:18,202
Marius will take the rear.

141
00:08:20,104 --> 00:08:21,593
Luna will handle close combat.

142
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:23,901
Lilia, as usual,
will move and act as she sees fit.

143
00:08:25,495 --> 00:08:26,797
Nin will be responsible
for restoring the shield force

144
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,991
and issue commands based on the situation…

145
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:31,010
Is something the matter, Lily?

146
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,098
Um,

147
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,803
can I be the one to give commands
during battle?

148
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:40,109
Already trying to make a change?

149
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,201
I understand.

150
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:45,399
It might be easier for Lily,
who takes the rear, to oversee the battle.

151
00:08:46,295 --> 00:08:47,397
Then Lily will be the main commander.

152
00:08:47,398 --> 00:08:48,804
Nin will support her.

153
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:50,263
Got it.

154
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,849
I'm counting on you, Lily.

155
00:08:53,606 --> 00:08:54,396
Sure.

156
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,595
Okay, let's go.

157
00:08:58,294 --> 00:08:59,489
"Dungeon Walk"!

158
00:09:04,696 --> 00:09:07,807
This space doesn't favour
those who rely on speed in combat.

159
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:11,599
But it's perfect for a tank like me.

160
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,580
The spawn location set for the monsters
is around here.

161
00:09:16,001 --> 00:09:17,488
It would seem so.

162
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:18,799
You can tell, too, Rud?

163
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,799
Only vaguely, though.

164
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:25,008
That's because you're the manager
of Avancier Labyrinth.

165
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:26,691
That's the reason?

166
00:09:27,499 --> 00:09:29,392
They've set it up quite cleverly.

167
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,102
"ADVENTURER, SPAWN LOCATION"
These two paths

168
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:36,295
lead to the same place,

169
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:39,792
but monsters will appear on both.

170
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,098
So, for example, even if we take the left
and encounter monsters,

171
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:45,605
the monsters from the right
will come at us from behind.

172
00:09:46,405 --> 00:09:48,420
So, they're trying to trap us?

173
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,003
Exactly.

174
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:51,093
The guardian here

175
00:09:51,093 --> 00:09:52,697
is a cunning one.

176
00:09:58,092 --> 00:09:59,191
It's the Poison Lizard!

177
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,906
The Black Owl is coming from the right!

178
00:10:03,308 --> 00:10:04,494
"Sacrificial Shield"!

179
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:05,896
"Taunt"!

180
00:10:10,596 --> 00:10:11,515
Poison gas?

181
00:10:16,203 --> 00:10:17,099
Sorry,

182
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,802
but abnormal statuses won't work on me.

183
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:31,598
It blocked the attack with its magic.

184
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,007
More Black Owls!

185
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:51,901
Rud,

186
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:53,698
we can take them,

187
00:10:53,698 --> 00:10:55,701
but we shouldn't waste energy here.

188
00:10:55,702 --> 00:10:56,887
You're right.

189
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:58,692
You guys keep going.

190
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,200
Leave this to me.

191
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,010
Got it.

192
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:02,513
Everyone, this way!

193
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:06,607
Flash magic stone!

194
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:16,400
Lily, your commands were on point.

195
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,661
They were easy to understand.

196
00:11:18,207 --> 00:11:19,903
I'll continue to do my best.

197
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:25,099
By the way, I just realised something.

198
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,791
Rud's Sacrificial Shield,

199
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:30,297
I think we can decide whether
to transfer the damage to you or not.

200
00:11:31,106 --> 00:11:32,802
Yes, I noticed that too.

201
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:34,801
We couldn't do that before.

202
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:37,094
Your skill level must have gone up

203
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:39,396
after you fought me!

204
00:11:39,397 --> 00:11:40,785
Maybe…

205
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,895
It's all thanks to me!

206
00:11:43,896 --> 00:11:46,699
That means we can disable
the damage absorption

207
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,703
whenever we want.

208
00:11:49,604 --> 00:11:52,210
But Rud's skills are certainly something.

209
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:56,396
It's rare to see a tank

210
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:58,092
that can perfectly distract the enemy.

211
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,893
That's true.

212
00:11:59,894 --> 00:12:03,096
I used to think all tanks could do that.

213
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,200
Rud's just
on a completely different level.

214
00:12:05,201 --> 00:12:06,897
Even if you say that…

215
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,596
It'd be great

216
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:12,512
if you could pick up
the "Self Recovery" skill too.

217
00:12:12,513 --> 00:12:15,186
That sounds like another difficult thing.

218
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:17,117
Does such a skill even exist?

219
00:12:17,118 --> 00:12:19,489
What? So humans don't know about this?

220
00:12:20,091 --> 00:12:22,094
"Humans"?

221
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,097
Are you not one yourself?

222
00:12:24,098 --> 00:12:27,398
Um, not entirely?

223
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,790
Incidentally,

224
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,995
we don't really know much about you.

225
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:32,001
That's true.

226
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,598
We risked our lives
to fight you last time,

227
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:37,094
but now you're not giving off
any malicious intent,

228
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:38,800
so it completely slipped our minds.

229
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,215
Marius,

230
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:43,289
if you don't mind,
would you tell us more about yourself?

231
00:12:43,289 --> 00:12:45,619
Only what you're comfortable with,
of course.

232
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:52,388
I was worried whether or not
you guys would accept me.

233
00:12:54,186 --> 00:12:54,999
Actually…

234
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:57,393
I am a demigod.

235
00:13:03,004 --> 00:13:03,908
A demigod?

236
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:05,284
Yes.

237
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,310
Broadly speaking,

238
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:10,330
the world consists
of humans and demihumans.

239
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,303
It is said that in the past,
there were even demigods.

240
00:13:13,304 --> 00:13:16,295
Demigods and demihumans
do not differ much in appearance,

241
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,299
but instead of god,

242
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:21,498
they worship the devil.
That's why they are known as demigods.

243
00:13:22,292 --> 00:13:24,303
That's the gist of it.

244
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,140
I can oversee the labyrinth
because I am a demigod.

245
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,474
What does that mean?

246
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,789
You didn't know?

247
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:35,003
It may seem as if humans
are benefitting from labyrinths,

248
00:13:35,004 --> 00:13:36,492
but labyrinths were created by the devil

249
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:40,188
to destroy the human world
in the first place.

250
00:13:40,794 --> 00:13:41,502
What?

251
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,902
So, labyrinths

252
00:13:42,903 --> 00:13:47,595
weren't created by god
to enrich our lives?

253
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:49,902
Where did you get that from?

254
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,504
Well, that fits the legend.

255
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:54,690
Indeed.

256
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:58,988
There might have been those
that knew the truth in the past.

257
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:01,891
Anyway, that's the story.

258
00:14:01,892 --> 00:14:05,093
So, this labyrinth must be
guarded by a demigod too,

259
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,897
and a strong one at that.

260
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:12,108
So, you better be careful
when you challenge the guardian.

261
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:13,795
We get that,

262
00:14:14,346 --> 00:14:16,791
but wouldn't that make them
kind of like your brethren?

263
00:14:17,595 --> 00:14:18,399
Are you really okay with that?

264
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:21,510
I hate those guys.

265
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:23,470
If I have to live like this,

266
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:25,197
I'd rather not be a demigod.

267
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,793
Instead, I want to defeat them as Marius.

268
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:29,414
I see…

269
00:14:29,415 --> 00:14:30,307
Sorry.

270
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,000
I had my own motives

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,124
for coming to this labyrinth
with you guys.

272
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:38,896
Well,

273
00:14:38,897 --> 00:14:41,172
I consider you a friend too.

274
00:14:41,796 --> 00:14:43,800
So, I'm counting on you.

275
00:14:46,097 --> 00:14:49,801
I have no objections
as long as you don't hurt Lily.

276
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,296
I'll pretend I heard nothing.

277
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:54,300
Same here.

278
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,101
We're friends as long as

279
00:14:56,102 --> 00:14:57,002
you don't hurt Lilia.

280
00:14:57,003 --> 00:14:59,397
I expected that.

281
00:14:59,397 --> 00:15:01,111
All right. I'm in too.

282
00:15:01,111 --> 00:15:01,910
Me too.

283
00:15:02,508 --> 00:15:03,319
Aren't you glad?

284
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,675
I owe it all to you.

285
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,306
Thanks, Rud.

286
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,397
Um…

287
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:10,794
Lily?

288
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:13,800
Sorry to ruin the mood,

289
00:15:13,801 --> 00:15:16,081
but I'd like to discuss the strategy

290
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:20,601
to deal with the monsters
on the 50th floor.

291
00:15:22,102 --> 00:15:23,193
Of course. I'll leave it to you.

292
00:15:23,804 --> 00:15:24,594
Yes.

293
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:29,095
First, the lizard.

294
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,513
I think we should play it safe…

295
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:35,100
We fought off the monsters

296
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,092
as they appeared and progressed.

297
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,189
Finally, we reached the 50th floor.

298
00:15:52,504 --> 00:15:54,499
There it is! The Bone Dragon!

299
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:56,009
Everyone, let's do this!

300
00:15:56,993 --> 00:15:57,889
"Taunt"!

301
00:16:00,086 --> 00:16:01,892
"Taunt" was effective.

302
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:04,196
We should be able
to proceed according to Lily's plan.

303
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:08,289
"ALL BONES, BONES FOR WINGS TOO"
According to the information

304
00:16:08,289 --> 00:16:09,264
"FOUR LEGS, LONG TAIL"
about the Bone Dragon,

305
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:10,392
"FOUR LEGS, LONG TAIL"
which appears on the 50th floor,

306
00:16:10,393 --> 00:16:13,307
it will frequently
use abnormal status skills.

307
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,084
That may disrupt our formation,

308
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:21,693
so Rud will go in and block it first.

309
00:16:21,694 --> 00:16:24,484
The rest of the party
should stay out of its range.

310
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,319
Understood.

311
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,489
Lilia and Marius will attack
from outside its range.

312
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:31,495
It's a bone monster,

313
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:32,305
so it's better

314
00:16:32,306 --> 00:16:34,996
to attack it by smashing it
rather than cutting it.

315
00:16:34,997 --> 00:16:35,815
Got it.

316
00:16:35,816 --> 00:16:36,418
Mhm.

317
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:39,900
Also, it's weak to fire.

318
00:16:39,901 --> 00:16:44,000
We should enchant our weapons with fire
before attacking it.

319
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,087
We should use mainly fire magic too.

320
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:47,507
In addition,

321
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,493
once the Bone Dragon's HP
is reduced to a certain amount,

322
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:51,404
its body will…

323
00:17:01,105 --> 00:17:01,891
Rud!

324
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,104
Thanks, Lily.

325
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:06,892
Don't mention it.

326
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:09,361
Taking cover under its wing is a no-go.

327
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,103
I'll have to be cautious
before I make my move too.

328
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:17,700
Master!

329
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,089
It's okay, Luna.

330
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:23,584
He left himself be pushed back
to put distance between them.

331
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,127
It is faster than I expected.

332
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,672
And this puts me too far from my party.

333
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:33,303
Thanks, you two.

334
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,930
No problem.
I've been trying to get pumped up.

335
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,723
Good. Let's keep this up.

336
00:17:39,886 --> 00:17:42,394
Its attacks are fast and powerful,

337
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,390
but as long as
we watch closely and be careful,

338
00:17:44,391 --> 00:17:45,480
we should be fine.

339
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,398
What's going on?

340
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:51,900
A ranged attack?

341
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,158
Are you guys all right?

342
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,690
It was a slight wound,

343
00:17:57,691 --> 00:18:00,508
but I seem to have been poisoned.

344
00:18:00,508 --> 00:18:01,302
Same.

345
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,707
Nin,

346
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,694
heal them while I distract it.

347
00:18:04,695 --> 00:18:06,002
Got it.

348
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,695
Luna, heal them with me.

349
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:08,587
Yes.

350
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:12,008
Take this!

351
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,504
We know you're weak to fire.

352
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:18,639
"Taunt"!

353
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,307
What? That thing…

354
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,714
It ignores "Taunt"

355
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:23,904
when it is continuously attacked

356
00:18:23,904 --> 00:18:25,812
and starts attacking randomly.

357
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,397
Rud, it's coming!

358
00:18:30,397 --> 00:18:32,007
I think my shoulder is dislocating…

359
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:36,303
My shield feels so heavy.

360
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:38,075
What's with this stuff?

361
00:18:38,825 --> 00:18:40,406
Someone cast water magic!

362
00:18:40,407 --> 00:18:41,787
The stuff is stuck on my shield,
and I can't move it…

363
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:46,097
This stuff is weighing down my shield…

364
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:47,191
Rud!

365
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,113
Thanks for that, Nin.

366
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:55,468
This is turning
into a battle of endurance.

367
00:18:56,193 --> 00:18:57,003
In that case…

368
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,389
What's that?

369
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,269
An automatic recovery area.

370
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,801
It's a saint skill that only Nin can use.

371
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:06,437
You can treat abrasions
just by standing there.

372
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,590
All set up.

373
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,399
Make the most of it.

374
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,109
Got it.

375
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,746
ONE HOUR LATER

376
00:19:14,747 --> 00:19:16,656
This thing is still going…

377
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,491
What?

378
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,411
This is the thing Lily mentioned…

379
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:27,123
Its "flame" is coming!

380
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,584
Everyone, take cover!

381
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,127
Rud?

382
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:38,000
Rud!

383
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,844
Master!

384
00:19:42,476 --> 00:19:44,433
Why are you guys surprised?

385
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,145
You think you can burn me
to a crisp with that?

386
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:50,022
"Taunt"!

387
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:58,822
The successive attacks

388
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,907
have depleted 5,000 shield force.

389
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,742
This is not looking good.

390
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,563
You were a bold one.

391
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:08,499
I'll kill you as you wish.

392
00:20:13,611 --> 00:20:14,505
Now!

393
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,590
It's working.

394
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,795
Just a little more
and we should be able to defeat it.

395
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,220
"Taunt"!

396
00:20:21,934 --> 00:20:24,014
Thank you, Rud!

397
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,184
This is just…

398
00:20:28,896 --> 00:20:30,385
a stepping stone for us!

399
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,998
"Life Conversion"!

400
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:46,203
It's the Bone Dragon's drop.

401
00:20:47,178 --> 00:20:48,178
Finally, it's over…

402
00:20:49,696 --> 00:20:52,196
Congratulations
on breaking through the 50th floor.

403
00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:53,800
Thanks.

404
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,338
But

405
00:20:56,338 --> 00:21:01,801
I don't think we're in any shape
to continue further.

406
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,692
Yeah.

407
00:21:02,692 --> 00:21:04,263
Let's call it a day.

408
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:09,393
Rud,

409
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,977
I think we should hold off

410
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,294
selling the loot we got today for now.

411
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,526
Otherwise, news of our raid might get out.

412
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:18,861
You have a point.

413
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,447
Then we'll sell them another time.

414
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:22,281
Lily,

415
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,208
the instructions you gave

416
00:21:23,209 --> 00:21:24,116
after returning to the city
were perfect too.

417
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,910
Um…

418
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,788
I'll do my best for the next floor too.

419
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,625
Now, as customary, let's celebrate!

420
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,585
Yes!

421
00:21:35,374 --> 00:21:37,261
I'll pass.

422
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:40,206
I'm a little tired.

423
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:41,967
I want to rest early.

424
00:21:43,997 --> 00:21:45,220
I'll head back too.

425
00:21:47,104 --> 00:21:48,766
See you tomorrow, everyone.
