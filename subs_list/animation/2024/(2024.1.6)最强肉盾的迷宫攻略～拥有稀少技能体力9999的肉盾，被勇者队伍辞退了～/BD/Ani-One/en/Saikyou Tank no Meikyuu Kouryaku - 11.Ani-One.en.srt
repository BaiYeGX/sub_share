1
00:00:00,996 --> 00:00:04,296
It's been a few weeks
since the Homunculi settled in Avancier.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,300
The much-anticipated public bathhouse
is slowly taking shape.

3
00:00:09,793 --> 00:00:11,599
Although many residents

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,598
were worried that Homunculi
staying in town would cause problems,

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:17,105
their diligence

6
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:23,398
and efforts

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,302
have garnered increasing support.

8
00:00:28,709 --> 00:00:30,198
Meanwhile,

9
00:00:31,296 --> 00:00:32,702
I've been undergoing mana training

10
00:00:32,702 --> 00:00:34,701
in the Avancier Labyrinth.

11
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:48,704
Demon Lord Greed could come
and claim the life of the strongest, me,

12
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,508
at any moment,

13
00:00:51,696 --> 00:00:53,893
and I must be prepared for it.

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,398
My senses must be sharpened.

15
00:01:05,395 --> 00:01:07,298
What an adorable baby!

16
00:01:07,807 --> 00:01:09,205
BAYBERN

17
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,902
A baby wyvern?

18
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:15,602
It would cost 70,000 points
to get this monster in a normal lottery.

19
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:17,206
You hit the jackport, Nin!

20
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:19,797
I got a little fairy.

21
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:22,096
LUFIA

22
00:01:22,408 --> 00:01:24,209
Oh, it's a devil fairy.

23
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:26,711
It should come in handy.

24
00:01:28,194 --> 00:01:29,604
Rud,

25
00:01:29,605 --> 00:01:32,108
thanks for letting us use the points.

26
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:34,894
Thanks to you,
I have a new cute little companion.

27
00:01:36,002 --> 00:01:37,206
Speaking of which,

28
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:39,705
being the labyrinth manager
is really something.

29
00:01:39,706 --> 00:01:41,806
You've gotten so close to the monsters.

30
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,303
They weren't affectionate with me at all

31
00:01:45,303 --> 00:01:47,403
when I was overseeing the labyrinth.

32
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:49,310
Well, their love is a little suffocating.

33
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:04,252
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

34
00:02:04,254 --> 00:02:09,903
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

35
00:03:20,207 --> 00:03:22,900
OPENING DAY OF THE PUBLIC BATHHOUSE

36
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:24,296
Today,

37
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,910
the public bathhouse opens its doors.

38
00:03:26,503 --> 00:03:28,607
The Homunculi built this, right?

39
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:30,102
Is it really okay to go inside?

40
00:03:31,494 --> 00:03:35,500
Though the reactions
of the residents remain split…

41
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:39,001
Is that the rumoured public bathhouse?

42
00:03:39,002 --> 00:03:41,304
Homunculi are amazing!

43
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,694
We'll be the first group of customers
to try it out.

44
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:45,905
Please look forward to it.

45
00:03:47,205 --> 00:03:48,506
I'm heading in.

46
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,104
Is this really all right?

47
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:54,194
It's been a long time
since I've been in such a beautiful bath.

48
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:56,603
Demon Lords bathe too?

49
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,903
Of course.

50
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,406
What do you take us for?

51
00:04:00,003 --> 00:04:03,008
We are no different
than humans in this regard.

52
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,300
I see.

53
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,711
By the way, where's Luna?

54
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,215
She says she's not used
to showing her body around others.

55
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,401
Is that so?

56
00:04:12,094 --> 00:04:14,898
But perhaps one day she'll come around.

57
00:04:14,898 --> 00:04:17,103
Let's invite her to join us
when she's ready.

58
00:04:17,104 --> 00:04:18,506
Yes, that's the plan.

59
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,307
All right!

60
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,302
Let's get in and enjoy the bath!

61
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:24,403
Indeed.

62
00:04:24,404 --> 00:04:26,305
It's quite spacious inside.

63
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,260
It's so luxurious that
it makes me feel a little nervous.

64
00:04:30,706 --> 00:04:33,804
Lilia, let's wash each other.

65
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:36,896
Bubble cat ears!

66
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:39,404
Don't play with bubbles as you wash!

67
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:42,604
Those two are the same as ever.

68
00:04:42,605 --> 00:04:45,215
All right. Let's do it too, Manicia!

69
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:50,499
I've always wanted
to bathe with a friend too.

70
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,003
I see…

71
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,094
Well, if you don't mind…

72
00:04:57,095 --> 00:04:58,000
All right!

73
00:04:58,001 --> 00:04:59,102
Wait…

74
00:04:59,103 --> 00:05:01,409
I want to join too!

75
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,505
Oh, whatever should I do?

76
00:05:06,593 --> 00:05:08,505
The water's quite warm.

77
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:09,994
Don't swim in the bath!

78
00:05:11,207 --> 00:05:12,499
Incidentally, Nin,

79
00:05:13,202 --> 00:05:16,902
you were taught
transformation magic in my class.

80
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:20,182
It's a shame there isn't a mixed bath.

81
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:21,396
Amon!

82
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,004
We agreed to keep that a secret!

83
00:05:24,608 --> 00:05:27,898
What kind of transformation magic
do you plan to use in the bath?

84
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:29,301
Magic to increase the size of one's bosom…

85
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:30,302
Amon.

86
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:33,239
Finish that sentence

87
00:05:33,239 --> 00:05:35,394
and I'll add the vegetables you hate
to your meals every day.

88
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:37,691
What? That would be awful!

89
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:38,380
Is it because

90
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,192
among the women close to Rud,

91
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,866
I am the most full-bosomed,
so you're jealous of me?

92
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:43,910
What?

93
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:45,900
We heard that.

94
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,105
Allow us to verify.

95
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,302
W… Wait!

96
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:53,800
Stop this at once!

97
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:58,610
So soft!

98
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:00,701
Unhand me!

99
00:06:00,702 --> 00:06:03,100
This is to punish you
for saying unnecessary things.

100
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:05,794
This is something Lilia doesn't have.

101
00:06:05,794 --> 00:06:08,100
Lily! Don't make unnecessary comments!

102
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,805
I was wrong! Please forgive me!

103
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,604
Something the matter, Manicia?

104
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:16,001
Not at all.

105
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:17,898
I'm just happy

106
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:21,708
that I can finally play
with others like this.

107
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,202
Your condition's a lot better now, right?

108
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:27,210
Yes.

109
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:28,601
Then,

110
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:31,405
you'll have plenty of opportunities
to try all sorts of things in the future.

111
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:33,106
I hope so.

112
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:35,211
Please!

113
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,994
It's my one and only request!

114
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:40,307
It's rather noisy in the men's bath.

115
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,195
We're begging you, Rud!

116
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:44,103
A little peek wouldn't hurt, right?

117
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:46,497
I'll just make a small hole in the wall.

118
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:47,995
Absolutely not!

119
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:49,103
Manicia's there too!

120
00:06:49,502 --> 00:06:52,703
And why are you trying
to peek as well, Marius?

121
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,801
I don't care about the view.

122
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,190
I just enjoy the thrill of it!

123
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:58,808
Don't be so blatant!

124
00:06:58,809 --> 00:06:59,898
Please!

125
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:01,593
I want to see Miss Lily's breasts!

126
00:07:01,594 --> 00:07:02,609
I want to see Manicia's…

127
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,808
Are they trying to peek
into the women's bath?

128
00:07:05,809 --> 00:07:06,554
I'll kill them!

129
00:07:06,555 --> 00:07:07,495
Hold on…

130
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:09,208
Amon, help me hold her back!

131
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:10,512
Rud!

132
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,804
We're all men here.

133
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:13,500
There's no point in wasting time arguing!

134
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,502
Exactly!

135
00:07:14,503 --> 00:07:16,502
Just to add, I want to see Lady Nin's!

136
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,598
I know she's flat,
but I still want to see them!

137
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:24,391
Who said that?

138
00:07:24,391 --> 00:07:25,898
Miss Nin, please calm down.

139
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:28,201
Enough!

140
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,301
Listen up.

141
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:34,202
All the girls you've been talking about
are pretty much the same size!

142
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,096
Stick to your fantasies
and behave yourselves!

143
00:07:44,194 --> 00:07:46,006
Rud, how did you find the bath?

144
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,506
It was amazing.

145
00:07:47,507 --> 00:07:49,803
Though, I had to put in some effort to stop
those adventurers from causing trouble.

146
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:52,204
Rud.

147
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:55,200
There isn't
anything dangerous inside, right?

148
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,602
Not at all. It was…

149
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,703
That felt great.

150
00:07:59,704 --> 00:08:00,314
Yes.

151
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,506
The neighbouring country's bathwater
temperature is excellent.

152
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:03,789
I could get addicted to it.

153
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:06,790
And the handmade soap is fantastic.

154
00:08:08,495 --> 00:08:09,304
You heard them.

155
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:11,905
Those adventurers looked like
they enjoyed themselves too.

156
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,304
Um…

157
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:19,106
We await your patronage,

158
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:22,103
so please come and try it someday.

159
00:08:26,597 --> 00:08:28,105
Got it.

160
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:32,410
Those men seemed
to have good reviews for the bath.

161
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:33,894
Let's give it a try too.

162
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:36,606
Is the fragrance on adventurers

163
00:08:36,606 --> 00:08:38,210
from the handmade soap they mentioned?

164
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,307
Mother, let's try it too.

165
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:43,100
The bath is free of charge today.

166
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,410
Please be sure to come and try it.

167
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:46,607
Let's try it too.

168
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:49,800
Manicia,

169
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,806
did you enjoy the bath?

170
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,803
Yes, the bath was enjoyable…

171
00:08:55,209 --> 00:08:56,302
But somehow,

172
00:08:56,303 --> 00:09:00,701
it feels like all of us were insulted.

173
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:04,401
Ah, that was a great bath.

174
00:09:05,301 --> 00:09:07,700
Oh, if it isn't the girls
used in our fantasies?

175
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,694
Lily.

176
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:11,105
On it, Lilia.

177
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:13,408
Fusion.

178
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:21,298
A FEW DAYS LATER

179
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:22,295
Thank you, everyone,

180
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:25,306
for helping build the public bathhouse.

181
00:09:25,306 --> 00:09:26,404
I enjoyed a nice bath.

182
00:09:26,404 --> 00:09:27,493
Thank you very much.

183
00:09:28,396 --> 00:09:30,310
With this public bathhouse,

184
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,104
the folks in town and the Homunculi
have gotten a lot closer.

185
00:09:34,005 --> 00:09:35,701
Please come again.

186
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:37,473
Saminina.

187
00:09:38,798 --> 00:09:41,399
Thank you for reaching out to humans.

188
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:47,199
This is for my own sake.

189
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:49,603
And you have been kind to us.

190
00:09:50,113 --> 00:09:51,198
Even so, thank you.

191
00:09:52,406 --> 00:09:53,383
Rud!

192
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,207
What's wrong?

193
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,995
Another fight between the adventurers?

194
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,325
A massive horde of monsters

195
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,809
is heading towards Avancier!

196
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:06,510
I heard there's a large group
of monsters coming towards the town.

197
00:10:07,004 --> 00:10:10,108
The guild seems to have issued
an urgent request to adventurers.

198
00:10:10,108 --> 00:10:12,507
After all, the vigilante corps alone
can't stop them.

199
00:10:16,998 --> 00:10:19,070
With so many people gathered,
we should be able to overcome this.

200
00:10:20,301 --> 00:10:21,109
Everyone.

201
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:24,606
We're up against over 150 monsters,

202
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:25,705
but there's no need to fret,

203
00:10:26,697 --> 00:10:28,895
as we are equally matched.

204
00:10:29,607 --> 00:10:31,408
Is that right?

205
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:35,700
You are aware we conquered that labyrinth.

206
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:36,909
Yes.

207
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:42,005
We conquered Caird Labyrinth,
the one the two major clans failed.

208
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,599
Adventurers fortunate enough
to participate in this battle

209
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,007
will receive generous rewards

210
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:50,502
for defeating the monsters.

211
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:55,009
Now, will you accept our request?

212
00:11:00,707 --> 00:11:02,114
Nice pitch.

213
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,206
-Reminds me of the ball in Caird.
-We're sure to win with Rud on our side.

214
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,292
-I did understate the numbers.
-I heard Luna's strong too.

215
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:09,697
-There must be about 300 of them.
-The twins will be there, too.

216
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:12,793
If it's over 100,
everyone will lose count.

217
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,810
And you just have to defeat all of them.

218
00:11:18,198 --> 00:11:19,692
Rud, do you have a moment?

219
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,015
I sense an unpleasant presence.

220
00:11:22,506 --> 00:11:25,803
It seems a new labyrinth
has appeared nearby.

221
00:11:25,804 --> 00:11:27,100
A new labyrinth?

222
00:11:27,702 --> 00:11:30,703
And it's a formidable one at that.

223
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,000
Could those monsters be connected
to the new Labyrinth?

224
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:36,911
"CONSUME POINTS"
It's a probability.

225
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:38,105
Though it's just my speculation.

226
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:40,192
But they must have cloned the monsters

227
00:11:40,193 --> 00:11:41,999
in the labyrinth and sent them out.

228
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:44,195
Can you do that?

229
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:45,293
Yes.

230
00:11:45,294 --> 00:11:47,900
So there might be even more monsters
than accounted for.

231
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:49,512
Got it.

232
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:53,602
You shall have the support of my magic.

233
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:56,305
I'll be at the frontline
cutting them down too.

234
00:11:56,801 --> 00:11:58,106
You two…

235
00:11:58,106 --> 00:11:59,793
We'll support you too.

236
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,507
Rud saved us that day.

237
00:12:07,597 --> 00:12:10,408
Wield me as your sword.

238
00:12:10,409 --> 00:12:12,509
Let us protect this town together.

239
00:12:13,696 --> 00:12:15,997
Saminina, everyone…

240
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,403
Thank you.

241
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,708
Baybern and Lufia want to help too?

242
00:12:26,911 --> 00:12:29,290
I have just the job for you guys.

243
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:38,102
This should strengthen our defence
as much as possible.

244
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:42,508
The monsters are in sight!

245
00:12:43,193 --> 00:12:44,403
Raise your weapons!

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,492
Release long range magic and skills

247
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:48,593
when the monsters are close!

248
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:06,304
Oi… that's more than 300 monsters!

249
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:07,898
This doesn't look good…

250
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:08,992
Don't back down!

251
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:10,013
Look!

252
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:12,297
The group of monsters
at the front are just Goblins.

253
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:13,598
No need to be afraid.

254
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,401
Attack!

255
00:13:22,713 --> 00:13:24,595
Looks like we took down quite a lot.

256
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:31,397
What's the deal with those monsters?

257
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:35,593
Those Goblins can use magic!

258
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:40,409
This is bad!

259
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:43,203
Those aren't normal monsters!

260
00:13:43,204 --> 00:13:43,704
We should run…

261
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:45,207
Ready?

262
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,294
Ready to engage at any time.

263
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,804
"Fusion" complete. Leave it to us.

264
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,998
All right. Let's do this.

265
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:55,395
"Taunt"!

266
00:14:00,096 --> 00:14:02,800
He managed to use "Taunt"
on all the monsters!

267
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,903
Using mana to strengthen the body.

268
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:08,004
He rushed straight to the centre.

269
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:09,098
Mister Rud is incredible!

270
00:14:11,507 --> 00:14:12,803
Rud, behind you!

271
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:16,814
I'm fine.

272
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,197
I see everything.

273
00:14:26,007 --> 00:14:27,205
Impressive.

274
00:14:27,206 --> 00:14:28,107
That lad

275
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:31,102
used mana to oversee the entire field.

276
00:14:32,308 --> 00:14:33,611
Let's continue the attack.

277
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:43,800
All right. We took care of them all.

278
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:46,695
This is all thanks to Rud
diverting the attention of the monsters.

279
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,806
That guy is really strong.

280
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,205
Your shield force's been fully restored.

281
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:53,098
Thanks.

282
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:57,206
After they died, they all disappeared,

283
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:58,694
which means

284
00:14:58,695 --> 00:15:00,901
those monsters really did
come out of a labyrinth.

285
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:03,194
What in the world is going on?

286
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:05,610
Here they come again!

287
00:15:05,611 --> 00:15:07,799
Another wave
of different monsters incoming!

288
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:09,893
We just defeated so many.

289
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,410
And there are more?

290
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,295
There are even Ogres this time!

291
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:14,996
Remain calm.

292
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,295
But… but…

293
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:17,403
Don't worry.

294
00:15:18,506 --> 00:15:19,595
We will be

295
00:15:19,595 --> 00:15:20,896
victorious.

296
00:15:22,403 --> 00:15:24,802
Another wave incoming!

297
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,896
Chameleon Kong and Fieldsaurus!

298
00:15:28,897 --> 00:15:30,901
Those are monsters
from Avancier Labyrinth!

299
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,294
Why are the monsters
in the labyrinth here?

300
00:15:33,295 --> 00:15:34,798
I can't fight anymore…

301
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:42,113
They're attacking the other monsters?

302
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:44,094
What's going on?

303
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,295
Finally!

304
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,509
Duplicate as many of the
Avancier Labyrinth monsters as you can

305
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,801
and bring them here to support us.

306
00:15:53,193 --> 00:15:56,397
It seems like things are going smoothly
on Lufia and Baybern's side.

307
00:15:57,201 --> 00:15:58,416
Everyone, don't worry.

308
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,898
The monsters from the Avancier Labyrinth
are now under my control.

309
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:03,805
They are our reinforcements.

310
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:04,999
Reinforcements?

311
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,047
Is that for real?

312
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,303
I will charge into the enemy's centre
along with the monsters.

313
00:16:08,304 --> 00:16:10,596
Support me as you did earlier.

314
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,305
"Taunt"!

315
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:26,197
Mister Rud is surrounded by Ogres!

316
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:27,600
That doesn't look good!

317
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:34,410
Labyrinth monsters
actually coming to aid humans.

318
00:16:35,891 --> 00:16:37,710
This is unheard of.
I can't believe my eyes!

319
00:16:41,897 --> 00:16:43,503
Mister Rud is amazing!

320
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:45,900
I didn't know you were so strong!

321
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,500
No, if it weren't for everyone's help,

322
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,592
I wouldn't be able to defeat them.

323
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,695
Thank you all for your hard work.

324
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,598
I brought some spinach.

325
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:56,708
Come to me if you're injured.

326
00:16:57,204 --> 00:16:59,897
I'll repair everyone's damaged weapons
for free.

327
00:17:04,897 --> 00:17:08,106
Thank you for helping protect this town.

328
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:11,207
That was a magnificent battle.

329
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:11,906
Amon.

330
00:17:12,296 --> 00:17:13,697
To think you would use

331
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:17,103
the opponent's trick against them.

332
00:17:17,894 --> 00:17:19,304
I just thought

333
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,106
if the enemy can do it, so can we.

334
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:22,899
But more than that,

335
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,304
the most important thing right now is

336
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:26,295
to raid the new labyrinth.

337
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,003
Releasing such a large number of monsters.

338
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:31,814
I cannot allow this dangerous labyrinth
to go unchecked.

339
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:33,501
Indeed.

340
00:17:34,201 --> 00:17:38,195
If it is him, he'll definitely release
even more monsters next time.

341
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:39,700
Him?

342
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,611
The new labyrinth is most likely

343
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:46,699
the work of Demon Lord Greed.

344
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:50,109
Demon Lord Greed…

345
00:17:52,007 --> 00:17:54,705
I sense his mana in the area.

346
00:17:55,398 --> 00:17:56,299
Then

347
00:17:57,002 --> 00:17:59,493
we have to get to Greed's labyrinth
as soon as possible.

348
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,596
We must stop him from creating
such disturbances again.

349
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:08,400
Rud…

350
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:13,200
What do you plan to do
after defeating Greed?

351
00:18:13,894 --> 00:18:16,905
Do you intend to extend
an invitation to him as you did with me?

352
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:19,993
I'm not sure if I should let him join us.

353
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,703
After all, I can't forgive him.

354
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:24,603
The Homunculi must hate him, too.

355
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,905
Are you going to kill him?

356
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,812
Greed is the only one who knows

357
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,004
the situation in Brunn Quelez.

358
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:33,210
If possible,
I'd like to capture him alive.

359
00:18:34,097 --> 00:18:36,505
In that case, use these.

360
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:41,092
These cuffs can seal
the power of a Demon Lord.

361
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:44,409
It's similar
to the slave bracelet I mentioned.

362
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:47,507
It should be useful
when you raid his labyrinth.

363
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,996
Thank you for all your help.

364
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,205
My pleasure.

365
00:18:51,206 --> 00:18:53,904
I do quite enjoy my life here.

366
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,900
All right. Let's get going.

367
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:58,302
No.

368
00:18:59,017 --> 00:19:03,411
This time,
Nin, Luna, Lilia, Lily, Saminina,

369
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,898
and I will go.

370
00:19:07,603 --> 00:19:09,410
Saminina's combat abilities
can contribute to our strength.

371
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:13,205
I want to put her powers to use
in the Greed Labyrinth.

372
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:15,299
Understood.

373
00:19:15,995 --> 00:19:17,689
What's the meaning of this, Rud?

374
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,115
Why am I being left out?

375
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:19,901
I'm sorry.

376
00:19:20,803 --> 00:19:22,705
I want you to stay in town
and lead the remaining adventurers.

377
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:25,714
Amon will be in charge
of the magic support team.

378
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:28,609
No, I want to fight too!

379
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:32,103
During the battle earlier,
I realised something.

380
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:35,195
Sending out the monsters
was part of Greed's strategy.

381
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,210
So even after we go in
to conquer the labyrinth,

382
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,703
he might still send more monsters.

383
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:44,404
You are closer to the adventurers,

384
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:45,893
and as the subleader of the clan,

385
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:46,914
you are trusted by everyone.

386
00:19:48,196 --> 00:19:50,788
I can only entrust
such a dangerous battlefield

387
00:19:50,788 --> 00:19:51,983
to you.

388
00:19:56,091 --> 00:19:58,210
All right. Let's do that then.

389
00:19:58,803 --> 00:20:00,108
Don't worry about things here.

390
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:01,693
Whatever comes,

391
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:03,614
I will defeat them all.

392
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,718
Leave the support command to me.

393
00:20:08,605 --> 00:20:10,507
Thank you both.

394
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,797
After the battle just now,

395
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:17,621
we've confirmed
that a new labyrinth has emerged nearby.

396
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,312
So, we're going to raid that labyrinth.

397
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:25,507
If monsters come to attack again,

398
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:28,711
please protect the town together
with Avancier's monsters.

399
00:20:36,597 --> 00:20:37,512
Um…

400
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,895
Yes?

401
00:20:38,896 --> 00:20:40,002
Is Demon Lord Greed

402
00:20:40,002 --> 00:20:43,302
really in the labyrinth
we're going to raid?

403
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,002
I'm afraid so.

404
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,918
You know who Greed is, right?

405
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,700
Of course.

406
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:54,000
Among the Homunculi, there's no one
who hasn't heard his name.

407
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,508
I see.

408
00:20:56,509 --> 00:20:58,701
Don't force yourself.

409
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,101
Yes.

410
00:21:06,992 --> 00:21:09,000
What's with this labyrinth?

411
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:11,091
There's nothing here.

412
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,316
I'll search the area with my magic.

413
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:19,612
There's really nothing here.

414
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,490
Let's move to the next level, then.

415
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,000
There doesn't appear

416
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,396
to be a magic circle that leads
to the next floor either.

417
00:21:27,396 --> 00:21:28,489
What?

418
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,414
That means…

419
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:32,801
this is the lowest floor of the labyrinth?

420
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:37,704
Such intense mana!

421
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,694
There's no need for such hostility.

422
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,710
My name is Greed.
