1
00:00:10,104 --> 00:00:14,437
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

2
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:19,833
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

3
00:01:33,995 --> 00:01:36,693
My name is Greed.

4
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:38,390
But

5
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,643
it seems you already know who I am.

6
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,901
Greed,

7
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:47,406
shut down the labyrinth immediately
and surrender.

8
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:50,005
If you do, I'll spare you.

9
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,016
Oh, my… And why should I?

10
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:56,033
We've wiped out all the monsters

11
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:57,159
you sent to the town.

12
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,369
You should be aware of our strength.

13
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,291
Is that so?

14
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,307
He sent out that many monsters again!

15
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,505
Rud, calm down!

16
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,489
That's right. I can't let him get to me.

17
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:15,050
It's regrettable.

18
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:16,634
Merely relying on the monsters
you've dispatched

19
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,471
won't be enough to defeat Avancier.

20
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:20,318
Is that really the case?

21
00:02:20,916 --> 00:02:26,312
I can continuously summon monsters
with nearly unlimited points, you know?

22
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,401
It's only a matter of time
before the town perishes.

23
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:33,011
Before that, we'll defeat you
and destroy this labyrinth.

24
00:02:35,092 --> 00:02:36,092
On another note,

25
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:38,599
there's something I've been curious about.

26
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:42,495
Those two over there

27
00:02:43,094 --> 00:02:44,802
are Homunculi, right?

28
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,594
Miss Luna is also a Homunculus?

29
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,115
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:55,006
Yes.

31
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,596
And?

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Nothing.

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,109
I'm just a little moved, that's all.

34
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:08,005
After all, in my past research,

35
00:03:08,005 --> 00:03:11,406
I've never seen Homunculi
grow as remarkably as you!

36
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:16,000
I never expected that living outside
could have such an impact on Homunculi!

37
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:17,605
How about it?

38
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,006
Won't you come back to me?

39
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,313
Sir Rud is my one and only

40
00:03:25,313 --> 00:03:26,704
master!

41
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,004
Luna. Rud.

42
00:03:32,806 --> 00:03:34,203
Why didn't you tell us?

43
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:36,912
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,307
I'm really sorry
that I kept it from you guys all this time…

45
00:03:42,308 --> 00:03:43,208
Good grief.

46
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:45,995
You better explain yourself
when we get back,

47
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,198
Luna!

48
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:52,813
Yes!

49
00:03:54,093 --> 00:03:55,486
My, my…

50
00:03:57,693 --> 00:03:58,808
In that case…

51
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:08,609
I might as well take everything by force.

52
00:04:10,197 --> 00:04:13,593
Although I'm not quite fond
of this form of mine very much.

53
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:20,292
Such a heavy attack!

54
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:23,308
But as long as I reinforce
my whole body with mana…

55
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,401
Saminina, dodge!

56
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:40,714
Are you all right?

57
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:43,193
I'm fine.

58
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:45,410
More importantly,

59
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:48,010
did you block that damage
with your shield force?

60
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:49,213
Yes.

61
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:50,402
You don't have to do that.

62
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,899
My life is meant

63
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,000
to save all Homunculi.

64
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,406
You can use me as a disposable weapon!

65
00:04:59,406 --> 00:05:02,213
So whether you live or die doesn't matter
as long as we defeat Greed?

66
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:03,599
Yes.

67
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:06,514
Then

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,109
you're not allowed to participate
in this battle.

69
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,515
Because I don't want anyone
to sacrifice themselves.

70
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,802
I am a Homunculus.

71
00:05:14,802 --> 00:05:16,114
I don't have a life to begin with.

72
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,604
Greed only sees you as tools to use.

73
00:05:20,997 --> 00:05:22,906
Are you trying to make me treat you

74
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:24,813
like the humans you despise?

75
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:27,494
If not,

76
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,594
then don't sacrifice yourself in battle,

77
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:31,000
do you understand?

78
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:35,307
Really.

79
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:38,401
I'm surprised you guys
still have the leisure to chat.

80
00:05:39,193 --> 00:05:40,401
"Magic Shield"!

81
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,693
You've got quite a few tricks
up your sleeves.

82
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,297
"Taunt"!

83
00:05:47,895 --> 00:05:49,213
Is that a skill?

84
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:51,104
How annoying.

85
00:05:58,609 --> 00:05:59,312
What?

86
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,099
I nullified your magic.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,802
How dare you!

88
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,209
You rascals! How dare you do this to me!

89
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,297
Let… Let go of me! Let go of me!

90
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:17,594
My power is being…

91
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:20,214
Could it be that these cuffs are…

92
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,797
Curses!

93
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:23,318
Curses!

94
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:25,609
Take this!

95
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:36,506
"Life Burst"!

96
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,906
Sir Hero…

97
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:40,906
Don't let your guard down!

98
00:06:40,906 --> 00:06:42,099
Y… Yes!

99
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:46,099
You guys did well.

100
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:48,515
So have some confidence in yourselves!

101
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,702
Yes.

102
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,312
Amazing!

103
00:07:00,007 --> 00:07:02,104
Miss Amon, please join the battle as well.

104
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:04,703
But I'm tired.

105
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,318
I do not fancy a man that is annoying.

106
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:10,911
Lady Manicia

107
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:14,604
prepared these super sweet doughnuts
for the hardworking Miss Amon.

108
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:16,703
Shall I tell her
not to bother preparing them

109
00:07:16,703 --> 00:07:19,000
since you are not participating
in the battle?

110
00:07:19,307 --> 00:07:20,509
W… What?

111
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,474
Why didn't you say so earlier?

112
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:25,296
I never said I wasn't going to fight!

113
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:29,302
My woeful kin,

114
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,094
return to the darkness!

115
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:35,516
"Chat Magic Balnoir"!

116
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:43,406
Run!

117
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:57,995
Please don't destroy the town.

118
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:01,104
Well then, let's take Greed back
to the town with us.

119
00:08:04,198 --> 00:08:05,094
What's this?

120
00:08:05,703 --> 00:08:08,000
Do Demon Lords have this kind
of magic stone in their chests?

121
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,812
No, could it be…

122
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:20,417
What's going on?

123
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:28,806
This magic…

124
00:08:29,307 --> 00:08:31,495
It's nothing like
we've ever been up against.

125
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,813
Are you the real one?

126
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,112
I created him
based on my memories and abilities,

127
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:53,901
so I'd say that Homunculus
is as good as the real one.

128
00:08:55,196 --> 00:08:58,297
Though its combat abilities
leave much to be desired.

129
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,119
My name is Greed.

130
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:03,906
A pleasure to make…

131
00:09:04,495 --> 00:09:07,203
I believe we can skip the formalities.

132
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:11,891
We'll soon bid each other farewell anyway.

133
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:15,013
If it's this attack speed…

134
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,823
Rud!

135
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:18,406
I'm fine!

136
00:09:19,496 --> 00:09:21,011
With a lift of his finger,

137
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:23,105
he can conjure up such a powerful attack!

138
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,505
I must use my mana to make myself stronger,
or I won't be able to defeat him.

139
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,015
Rud!

140
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,508
Seems we can't use the move
we used against Amon to deal with him.

141
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,406
Skill: "Fusion"!

142
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,904
Don't worry.

143
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:54,906
Keep attacking like this.

144
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:05,536
Prepare yourself!

145
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:08,630
Miss Saminina!

146
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,703
Thank you!

147
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,510
Everyone, regroup.

148
00:10:22,214 --> 00:10:23,021
What's going on?

149
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:31,922
Master!

150
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,220
That took a great deal
off my shield force.

151
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:39,708
I'll distract him.

152
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,505
Please restore Rud's shield force.

153
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:42,308
Got it.

154
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,797
Even as Lilialy,

155
00:10:47,797 --> 00:10:50,099
they can only defend against Greed.

156
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:52,604
We'll have to seize the opportunity

157
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:54,906
and take him down
with one powerful strike.

158
00:10:55,368 --> 00:10:56,818
Otherwise, we won't stand a chance.

159
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,616
"Taunt"!

160
00:11:07,806 --> 00:11:08,708
It's futile.

161
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:23,099
I've accumulated 20,000 damage so far.

162
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:25,318
Let's settle this with this move!

163
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,500
"Life Conversion"!

164
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:33,818
Luna! Saminina!

165
00:11:34,303 --> 00:11:35,589
Get them to Nin!

166
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:36,506
Got it.

167
00:11:40,896 --> 00:11:41,828
No way!

168
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,625
Lilia and Lily are incapacitated.

169
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,224
What should we do?

170
00:11:53,507 --> 00:11:55,298
Even with my current mana enhancement,

171
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,109
I stand no chance against him
in speed and strength.

172
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,395
More…

173
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:01,813
I need to channel more mana into my body!

174
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:12,500
Dang it!

175
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:15,214
That one hit
depleted all of my shield force!

176
00:12:16,308 --> 00:12:17,104
But this means

177
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,411
I can use "Life Conversion" one more time.

178
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,109
Let the mana flow throughout my body.

179
00:12:22,703 --> 00:12:25,302
This time, I have to finish him
with everything I've got!

180
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:27,703
"Life Conversion"!

181
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,503
Rud!

182
00:12:37,094 --> 00:12:39,808
Did my shield shatter?

183
00:12:41,297 --> 00:12:42,703
Even with the mana enhancement,

184
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:45,797
it hurts so much I can't move.

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Everyone, run!

186
00:12:53,692 --> 00:12:54,916
What happened?

187
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:56,036
Miss Luna! Miss Nin! Get behind me!

188
00:12:56,036 --> 00:13:00,911
-Was I knocked away by Greed's attack?
-Luna, get over here!

189
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,599
Saminina!

190
00:13:03,599 --> 00:13:05,297
-I have to hurry…
-Dang it!

191
00:13:05,297 --> 00:13:07,813
I have to save everyone!

192
00:13:08,798 --> 00:13:10,007
Dang… Dang it!

193
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:12,413
I can't muster up my mana…

194
00:13:13,507 --> 00:13:14,908
Come on!

195
00:13:17,408 --> 00:13:18,913
Everyone's shield force…

196
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:22,204
is depleted!

197
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:34,694
Luna!

198
00:13:36,002 --> 00:13:37,609
At this rate,

199
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,704
Luna and everyone will...

200
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:41,905
Get up!

201
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:44,398
Please!

202
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:46,910
Curses!

203
00:13:47,514 --> 00:13:48,799
Let all my mana

204
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,512
flow through my body.

205
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:53,517
Ignore the pain.

206
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:55,705
Break the limits!

207
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:57,212
I am...

208
00:13:58,102 --> 00:14:00,793
the tank of this party!

209
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:17,793
Rud?

210
00:14:25,595 --> 00:14:28,304
R… Rud?

211
00:14:35,798 --> 00:14:37,100
Destroy!

212
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:40,100
-There's a voice echoing in my head.
-Destroy!

213
00:14:40,101 --> 00:14:42,002
Destroy!

214
00:14:42,002 --> 00:14:47,195
-It wants me to destroy everything.
-Destroy…

215
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,413
Channel more mana into my body.

216
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:06,699
Keep hitting until this guy breaks!

217
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:08,700
Over and over!

218
00:15:09,293 --> 00:15:10,590
Over and over!

219
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:12,412
Over and over!

220
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:18,913
This is... so satisfying!

221
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:20,225
Rud!

222
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:24,403
Who is it?

223
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:27,903
I can't see them.

224
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:30,704
Is there someone else here?

225
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:33,512
Then,

226
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:35,991
I must destroy them too.

227
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:43,609
Come to your senses!

228
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:46,298
Nin?

229
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:48,194
I put some magic in that slap.

230
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,199
Well? Are you back to normal?

231
00:15:50,512 --> 00:15:51,908
Uh… yeah.

232
00:15:53,908 --> 00:15:56,205
I was consumed by my mana.

233
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,814
Is that why I lost control?

234
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,089
Rud!

235
00:16:05,703 --> 00:16:07,704
My mana is acting up again…

236
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:12,296
Destroy...

237
00:16:12,298 --> 00:16:13,709
You should learn to control it.

238
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,298
Those who cannot control their mana

239
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:17,907
will become monsters.

240
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:19,605
That voice...

241
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:22,595
I've heard that voice somewhere before.

242
00:16:23,913 --> 00:16:24,804
That's…

243
00:16:27,595 --> 00:16:29,303
my voice.

244
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:33,197
If this continues,

245
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,595
I might turn into a monster
and go berserk.

246
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,923
Rud!

247
00:16:37,923 --> 00:16:38,998
Deep breaths.

248
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,409
I need to control my mana.

249
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:45,007
Rud!

250
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,403
Rud!

251
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:51,677
Thank you, Nin.

252
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,796
Thanks to you,

253
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:55,730
I was able to keep my mana under control.

254
00:16:58,298 --> 00:16:59,393
Thank goodness.

255
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:05,622
Now's not the time
to let myself be overwhelmed by my mana.

256
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:09,512
I have to protect everyone.

257
00:17:14,106 --> 00:17:15,299
Greed!

258
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:21,189
The town you wish to protect is no more!

259
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:23,918
I'll make sure they,

260
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,705
along with your party,

261
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:28,413
are completely eradicated

262
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:32,007
from this world!

263
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:35,694
Nin, I need your help.

264
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,924
Keep casting healing magic on me.

265
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,908
Don't stop for even a second.

266
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,902
I want to bet everything

267
00:17:45,485 --> 00:17:46,788
on this strike.

268
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,106
I know this request is reckless...

269
00:17:50,804 --> 00:17:52,122
What are you saying at a time like this?

270
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:55,413
I'm the healer of this party.

271
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:57,580
Go ahead and do what you need to do!

272
00:17:58,304 --> 00:17:59,116
Will do.

273
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:02,007
Just hold on a little longer, everyone!
Don't give up!

274
00:18:02,007 --> 00:18:04,594
Life Burst!

275
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:08,295
You're a hundred years too early
to lay a hand on me!

276
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,413
Here's a newly made sword.

277
00:18:10,413 --> 00:18:12,089
Take it!

278
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,407
Please heal the ones over there first

279
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:15,507
and get more bandages.

280
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:20,391
Greed,

281
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,315
we owe all of this to you.

282
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,709
Adventurers,

283
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,908
Vigilante Corps,

284
00:18:25,908 --> 00:18:27,314
Homunculi,

285
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,314
Marius,

286
00:18:28,314 --> 00:18:29,108
Amon,

287
00:18:29,692 --> 00:18:31,606
as long as I'm in the same space
with everyone,

288
00:18:31,606 --> 00:18:33,101
my skills can link them.

289
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:38,309
"Sacrificial Shield"!

290
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,205
My body suddenly became lighter.

291
00:18:42,206 --> 00:18:43,382
What's going on?

292
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,512
The shield force isn't decreasing anymore.

293
00:18:46,116 --> 00:18:48,110
Is this…

294
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:49,788
Rud's skill?

295
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,914
Greed.

296
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:55,902
Thanks to you showing me
the vision of Avancier,

297
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,205
I was able to transfer
all the shield force damage from everyone

298
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:01,502
in this space onto myself.

299
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:07,892
As the strongest tank,

300
00:19:12,903 --> 00:19:14,091
I will protect…

301
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:16,990
everyone!

302
00:19:19,486 --> 00:19:23,200
"Life Conversion"!

303
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:45,413
Big Brother?

304
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:47,689
Is that Rud?

305
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:48,908
Have they returned?

306
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:50,699
It's Rud!

307
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:52,600
Rud!

308
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:53,693
Big Brother!

309
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:56,236
Manicia!

310
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,605
Everyone!

311
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,799
Big Brother!

312
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:05,716
I always believed

313
00:20:06,199 --> 00:20:08,402
you would come back!

314
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:12,695
I've always come back, haven't I?

315
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,048
That's true.

316
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,051
Welcome back, Big Brother!

317
00:20:19,911 --> 00:20:21,502
I'm back, Manicia.

318
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:23,606
Rud!

319
00:20:24,202 --> 00:20:25,408
Marius. Amon.

320
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:27,319
Is everyone all right?

321
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,311
There were just too many of them.

322
00:20:29,754 --> 00:20:32,648
I couldn't hold all of them back
like you did.

323
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,001
But we managed to hold the fort.

324
00:20:35,416 --> 00:20:36,902
Thank you.

325
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:39,321
Rud!

326
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,205
You actually conquered the labyrinth
in such a short time!

327
00:20:44,205 --> 00:20:45,413
Incredible!

328
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:46,787
Everyone…

329
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,208
It's thanks to all of you
for helping protect Avancier,

330
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,335
that we were able
to successfully destroy the labyrinth.

331
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:55,463
Thank you, everyone.

332
00:20:58,913 --> 00:21:00,095
Mister Rud?

333
00:21:05,106 --> 00:21:06,891
Rud really is

334
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:10,913
the strongest tank!

335
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,100
I am Rud. I am a tank.

336
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:11,689
This is the story of how I, a tank,

337
00:23:12,595 --> 00:23:14,851
became a hero.

338
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,793
I will continue to work hard

339
00:23:18,501 --> 00:23:20,289
and protect everyone.
