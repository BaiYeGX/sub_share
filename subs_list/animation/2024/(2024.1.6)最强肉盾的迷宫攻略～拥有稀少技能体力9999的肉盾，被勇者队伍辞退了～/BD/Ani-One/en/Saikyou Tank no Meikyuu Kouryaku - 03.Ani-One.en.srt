1
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:04,313
Morning, Manicia.

2
00:00:04,314 --> 00:00:06,006
Big Brother, good…

3
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:08,966
Good morning.

4
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,594
I'll bring breakfast over right away.

5
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:12,596
I'll help you…

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:13,931
I can manage by myself.

7
00:00:17,594 --> 00:00:19,807
Master, Lady Manicia,

8
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:21,798
I'm so sorry for being late
to prepare breakfast.

9
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:24,399
You've already prepared breakfast.

10
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:28,099
Looks like you're still not used
to getting up early.

11
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:30,100
That's quite the bed hair you have there.

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:35,037
I'm so embarrassed by my tardiness.

13
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:38,197
Don't worry about it.

14
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:39,995
Living under the same roof
means we should help each other.

15
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:41,234
But…

16
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:44,297
I just can't help but feel
I'm the only one receiving help.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,499
That's not true.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,906
It is.

19
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:51,594
You've not only helped me
lead a regular life

20
00:00:52,203 --> 00:00:54,805
but also taught me all sorts of things.

21
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,370
Speaking of which,
both of you seem quite knowledgeable.

22
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,099
May I know who taught you all of this?

23
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:06,760
I see.

24
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:08,693
"Apprentices"?

25
00:01:09,292 --> 00:01:11,196
I told you we used to live in the slums.

26
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:13,197
The apprenticeship system,

27
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:16,396
in simple terms,
is a master-apprentice relationship.

28
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:20,353
Back then,
there was this trend among nobles

29
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:22,594
to guide children from the slums
onto the right path.

30
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:25,208
And because of that,
we got the chance to study

31
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,302
at the Knight Academy.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,089
Knight Academy?

33
00:01:32,604 --> 00:01:35,687
He can't pursue his dreams
because of his sister.

34
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:37,396
I feel so sorry for Rud.

35
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:38,807
Manicia?

36
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:40,709
Manicia.

37
00:01:41,589 --> 00:01:43,193
Yes?

38
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:46,098
I'll be heading to the town in a bit.
Is there anything you need?

39
00:01:46,099 --> 00:01:48,494
No… Not really.

40
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:49,495
I see.

41
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:07,276
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

42
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:12,883
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

43
00:03:28,406 --> 00:03:29,900
Rud is incredible!

44
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,192
As expected of Rud.

45
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:32,808
You'll definitely become a knight!

46
00:03:33,401 --> 00:03:34,307
My big brother

47
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:37,213
used to come out on top of every exam.
He was an outstanding student.

48
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:41,693
Everyone thought he was sure
to become a knight.

49
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:43,698
But…

50
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,099
Have you heard?

51
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,995
Rumour has it that Rud

52
00:03:46,996 --> 00:03:51,005
has decided to become an adventurer
to cure his sister's illness.

53
00:03:51,005 --> 00:03:52,005
No way.

54
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:53,802
But he has so much potential.

55
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:57,796
He can't pursue his dreams
because of his sister.

56
00:03:57,797 --> 00:03:59,807
I feel so sorry for Rud.

57
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:03,192
My existence

58
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:06,515
made it impossible for him
to choose all the doors open to him.

59
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:14,896
Come in.

60
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,799
Are you not feeling well?

61
00:04:19,094 --> 00:04:22,401
No, I'm fine.
I just remembered some things.

62
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:26,975
Miss Luna?

63
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:29,807
You looked sad,

64
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:30,895
so I thought this would
help you feel better.

65
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:35,608
I'm sorry I don't have
a better way of cheering you up.

66
00:04:38,594 --> 00:04:40,099
Miss Luna, if…

67
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:45,692
If someone was willing
to give up their life for your sake,

68
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:47,203
what would you do?

69
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,906
That person could've chosen a better path
that could've made them happier.

70
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:54,411
But he gave them all up

71
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:56,500
and chose the difficult path
for your sake.

72
00:04:57,406 --> 00:05:01,208
Even though
he could've lead a happier life…

73
00:05:02,706 --> 00:05:03,895
How would you face

74
00:05:03,896 --> 00:05:05,693
a person like that?

75
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:09,400
Well,

76
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:13,021
I don't know if anyone would be
willing to go that far for me,

77
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:14,906
but

78
00:05:14,906 --> 00:05:17,598
for that person,
the path he chose is undoubtedly the one

79
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:19,911
that makes him the happiest, isn't it?

80
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:24,068
The happiest for that person…

81
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,994
You are talking about Master, are you not?

82
00:05:26,995 --> 00:05:28,500
No, no…

83
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,609
Perhaps you should try
to be honest with him.

84
00:05:34,703 --> 00:05:38,203
Master was willing to help
an illegal Homunculus like me.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,099
I believe he looks at things differently
than others.

86
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:44,302
But…

87
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:48,802
I'm not sure how I should face him…

88
00:05:50,906 --> 00:05:52,995
I tell myself
I shouldn't rely on him too much,

89
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,297
so I try to keep my distance
as much as possible.

90
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:00,703
But the truth is…

91
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:02,995
I really want to treat him gently.

92
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,495
I'm so conflicted.
I don't know what to do…

93
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:11,693
Why not tell him
all of your feelings, then?

94
00:06:13,698 --> 00:06:16,296
"SKILL: MARKER"
He… He's back!

95
00:06:16,297 --> 00:06:17,802
What… What do I do?

96
00:06:17,802 --> 00:06:19,104
What should I tell him?

97
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:24,995
We cannot tell what another is thinking,

98
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:29,096
so,

99
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:30,097
just try expressing your thoughts to him.

100
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:32,100
There.

101
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:35,406
I'm home, girls.

102
00:06:35,406 --> 00:06:36,916
Look at all the magic greens I got…

103
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:37,797
Big Brother,

104
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:40,698
I have a question for you.

105
00:06:45,396 --> 00:06:46,198
What is it?

106
00:06:51,198 --> 00:06:52,089
I'm scared.

107
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:54,497
What… What if

108
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:58,000
Big Brother regrets saving me?

109
00:07:10,198 --> 00:07:13,198
Are you happy with your life right now?

110
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:14,599
Of course.

111
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:18,187
How can you say that with such conviction?

112
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:21,896
Even though there are so many other paths
that can make you happier…

113
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:24,698
Big… Big Brother,

114
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:29,407
why did you come back for me
after I was abandoned?

115
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:31,203
Because…

116
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:35,089
You saved me back then.

117
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:37,808
I… did?

118
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:41,794
Do you remember when I was a kid?

119
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,298
I was often called scary
because I was taller than everyone

120
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:48,099
and had a stern face.

121
00:07:49,396 --> 00:07:50,896
It's Old Man Rud!

122
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:52,505
He's scary! Let's get out of here!

123
00:07:54,302 --> 00:07:56,104
I just wanted to play with everyone…

124
00:07:58,505 --> 00:07:59,588
Big Brother!

125
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:02,190
But you,

126
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,099
you always stuck by my side
without any fear.

127
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,113
Every time that happened,
it made me really happy.

128
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:11,588
When I decided to live with you,

129
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:13,407
sure, I had some doubts,

130
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:16,532
but I've never thought

131
00:08:17,188 --> 00:08:18,803
I made the wrong decision.

132
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:24,395
Because I really love the time
we spend together.

133
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:26,007
To me, that's when I'm the happiest.

134
00:08:31,193 --> 00:08:32,203
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:33,495 --> 00:08:37,094
I assumed how you felt.

136
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:41,099
I thought you weren't happy
because you had to put up with me.

137
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:44,899
And because of that,

138
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,520
I've been unsure about how to face you.

139
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:48,895
Don't say that.

140
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm the one that's never been good
at figuring out what others are thinking.

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,802
I'm sorry.

142
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:54,812
I know.

143
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,204
I know you better than anyone.

144
00:08:58,795 --> 00:09:02,493
That's why I should be more independent.

145
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,087
That's not true at all, Manicia.

146
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:10,391
Big Brother…

147
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,994
Thank you, Luna.

148
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:15,538
But I didn't do anything.

149
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,802
If it weren't for Miss Luna,

150
00:09:18,802 --> 00:09:20,393
I'd have twisted myself into knots
worrying over this.

151
00:09:21,099 --> 00:09:21,797
That's why

152
00:09:22,432 --> 00:09:23,583
I'm really thankful to you.

153
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,203
It's... It's almost time for lunch.

154
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:30,820
I'll prepare the meal.

155
00:09:31,891 --> 00:09:33,485
Let's help too.

156
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:35,700
Yes, Big Brother.

157
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:40,302
Who is it?

158
00:09:40,302 --> 00:09:42,498
Who dares disturb
my moment of joy with my sister?

159
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:47,202
Rud, it's been a while.

160
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:49,005
Nin? Why are you here?

161
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,716
I'm here for you, of course.

162
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,958
They finally gave me some time off.

163
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,198
I'm surprised Kygras let you.

164
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:57,906
It wasn't Kygras.

165
00:09:57,906 --> 00:09:59,416
The church gave me the break.

166
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,144
I'm no longer in the hero's party.

167
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,563
After you left,

168
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,348
we haven't been successful
in our labyrinth raids,

169
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,203
so the party's been disbanded.

170
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:23,505
Everyone, battle formation!

171
00:10:27,503 --> 00:10:29,806
Lilia, what have you been doing?

172
00:10:29,807 --> 00:10:30,797
Fight seriously!

173
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:31,901
I am!

174
00:10:37,797 --> 00:10:38,703
Drats!

175
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,890
Why can't we damage it?

176
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,193
Why are our shields wearing out so fast?

177
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:45,895
What's different from before?

178
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:48,500
Sir Kygras!

179
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:51,406
Another portal opened up.

180
00:10:51,906 --> 00:10:53,396
A new monster is coming.

181
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:59,198
"Life Burst"!

182
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:02,807
Activating the skill

183
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:05,110
cost me 1000 shield force points.

184
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:08,406
I never knew it cost so much
to use Life Burst.

185
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:12,407
Ever since that guy left,
my skill's power has weakened.

186
00:11:12,995 --> 00:11:15,116
My shield force's been depleting
abnormally fast too.

187
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:17,692
Don't tell me…

188
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,703
No. That can't be.

189
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:24,568
I…

190
00:11:26,313 --> 00:11:28,021
I am never wrong!

191
00:11:29,297 --> 00:11:29,995
I did it!

192
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:33,401
Just one more…

193
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,905
Um… Sir Kygras?

194
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:38,396
What?

195
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,896
Maybe the difficulty of this level
is more than we can handle.

196
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,599
Forgive me for saying this,

197
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,912
but because we aren't able
to defeat all the monsters,

198
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,955
more and more keep showing up…

199
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:47,594
Shut up.

200
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,906
Nin, hurry up and heal me!

201
00:11:50,505 --> 00:11:52,009
What are you talking about?

202
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,379
I'm not retreating!

203
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:57,401
I can't fail again…

204
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:00,896
"Life Burst"!

205
00:12:02,906 --> 00:12:03,807
It's not working.

206
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:14,004
He used up all his shield force.

207
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:14,906
Kygras!

208
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:18,010
To think it hurts this much

209
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,489
without the shield force…

210
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:32,210
No!

211
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,394
No… I don't want to die…

212
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,796
I can't die…

213
00:12:49,488 --> 00:12:50,812
Get us out of here, Lily!

214
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:52,498
Okay.

215
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:53,690
"Dungeon Walk"!

216
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:05,441
Curses!

217
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:08,096
Evasion-type tank? What a load of bull!

218
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:11,696
Because of you,
my reputation is in tatters!

219
00:13:12,103 --> 00:13:13,706
We're sorry…

220
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:14,707
We're ashamed.

221
00:13:15,701 --> 00:13:16,806
That's not right.

222
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:20,400
They did nothing wrong.

223
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:22,701
This time and the previous times,

224
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:26,003
we failed
because you charged in recklessly.

225
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:26,598
Huh?

226
00:13:27,295 --> 00:13:28,988
When did you stop training?

227
00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:32,386
You're frail now,
and you've damaged your body

228
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,480
by all the alcohol you've been drinking.

229
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,192
Even though you've been relying
on "Life Burst" to make your way so far,

230
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:41,586
do you really think that's enough
to conquer all labyrinths?

231
00:13:41,587 --> 00:13:43,893
It… It's worked so far, hasn't it?

232
00:13:43,894 --> 00:13:45,493
That's because we had Rud.

233
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,201
Since Rud left,

234
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:50,288
you finally realised
how your skill works, right?

235
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:52,097
I can tell.

236
00:13:52,904 --> 00:13:55,889
"Life Burst" strengthens your body,

237
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,806
but it consumes a high amount
of shield force at the same time.

238
00:13:59,103 --> 00:14:01,712
The day Rud exhausted his shield force,

239
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:04,889
you unleashed the most powerful
"Life Burst" you've ever used.

240
00:14:05,486 --> 00:14:07,001
After that day, I realised

241
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:08,865
Rud's unknown skill
allowed him to substitute himself

242
00:14:08,866 --> 00:14:10,894
for the depleted shield forces.

243
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:15,003
So, the cost you paid for using the skill
was transferred to him.

244
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:19,285
After all, you used
Rud's 9999 resistance skill.

245
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:20,884
It's no wonder your skill
became so powerful.

246
00:14:20,885 --> 00:14:24,206
No, it was all me.

247
00:14:24,207 --> 00:14:26,300
All I did was kick out a useless tank.

248
00:14:26,301 --> 00:14:28,994
How… How could it turn me into this?

249
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:30,598
I'm a hero!

250
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:35,114
Enough. I've already left the party.

251
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,400
You can continue blaming others
and live an easy life.

252
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:40,091
I'm leaving too. Sorry.

253
00:14:40,092 --> 00:14:43,195
I'm sorry.
I might have to go train myself more.

254
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:44,196
Curse you all!

255
00:14:44,197 --> 00:14:46,695
I'll recover in no time
and prove it to you!

256
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:47,998
I'm the strongest!

257
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:49,503
I'm the hero!

258
00:14:50,795 --> 00:14:51,701
That's the story.

259
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:54,207
After that, everyone left the party.

260
00:14:54,858 --> 00:14:56,104
It must've been rough for you guys.

261
00:14:56,712 --> 00:15:00,029
I only recently figured out
the effects of my skills.

262
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,067
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused.

263
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:03,469
You don't have to apologise.

264
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,863
It's our fault for not noticing too.

265
00:15:06,691 --> 00:15:08,587
Rud, I'm sorry
for everything up until now.

266
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,538
We didn't realise
that you were taking on the damage for us.

267
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,082
We were careless
and let ourselves get carried away.

268
00:15:16,603 --> 00:15:17,625
I'm very sorry.

269
00:15:18,311 --> 00:15:19,794
Same here.

270
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,381
If only I had figured out
the effects of my skills sooner.

271
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:25,675
So, I'm sorry too.

272
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:27,696
Well, then,

273
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:29,695
let's put this matter behind us now.

274
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:31,831
No use dwelling on the past.

275
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,602
She's still the same as ever,
always so quick to recover.

276
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,702
You two must be Manicia and Luna.

277
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:42,789
Hello, Miss Nin.

278
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,193
It's nice to meet you.

279
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,301
I plan to stay here for a while.

280
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:49,306
Maybe check out the plantations.
I'll be in your care.

281
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:51,492
Stay here for a while?

282
00:15:52,004 --> 00:15:54,207
What? You want me to leave so soon?

283
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,613
That's not what I meant.

284
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:58,395
There are no inns in this town.

285
00:15:58,396 --> 00:15:59,748
We get adventurers every now and then,

286
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:01,400
but they have to rent vacant rooms too.

287
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,170
I see.

288
00:16:03,182 --> 00:16:03,806
What should I do, then?

289
00:16:04,415 --> 00:16:05,243
In that case,

290
00:16:05,243 --> 00:16:07,092
why not let Miss Nin stay with us?

291
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:08,676
Can I?

292
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,280
If you don't mind sharing a room with me.

293
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:11,894
No, no, no, Manicia.

294
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:13,347
I didn't mention it earlier,

295
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,993
but Nin is the daughter of a duke.
She's a genuine noble

296
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:17,977
and a saint.

297
00:16:18,681 --> 00:16:21,893
Hey, don't go telling them
unnecessary things.

298
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:23,165
Manicia, I don't mind at all.

299
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,268
If we upset the saint,

300
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:28,305
we'd be on the church's hitlist.

301
00:16:29,894 --> 00:16:31,097
Considering all that,

302
00:16:31,097 --> 00:16:32,191
you'll be staying in my room.

303
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:34,592
It's rather dull, isn't it?

304
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:37,982
But it certainly spells you.

305
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:39,076
It's reassuring, somehow.

306
00:16:39,077 --> 00:16:40,416
I'll be sleeping in the living room.

307
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:41,501
Let's go with that for now.

308
00:16:41,993 --> 00:16:45,212
Well, I wouldn't mind
sleeping in the same bed as you, Rud.

309
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:47,298
Drop the act.

310
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:49,092
Oh, you saw through that?

311
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:51,388
Well,

312
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:54,795
I wasn't entirely joking…

313
00:16:57,503 --> 00:16:58,321
Rud!

314
00:16:58,321 --> 00:16:59,493
Rud, are you home?

315
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,504
Fil?

316
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:03,992
Rud!

317
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:04,795
At the orchard!

318
00:17:06,296 --> 00:17:08,207
A monster
we've never seen before has appeared!

319
00:17:10,691 --> 00:17:11,753
The orchard's completely destroyed!

320
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,907
This must be that monster's doing.

321
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,077
We have to hurry up
and defeat it, or else…

322
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:17,389
Sorry

323
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,190
for dragging you into this, Nin.

324
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:20,690
Now, you're being a stranger.

325
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,498
We were members
in the same party, weren't we?

326
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:24,186
Found it. It's that thing.

327
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:26,086
Is that a wolf?

328
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:26,894
No. A tiger?

329
00:17:27,508 --> 00:17:29,893
It's hard to tell
with the magic element surrounding it.

330
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:30,805
Magic element?

331
00:17:30,806 --> 00:17:32,284
You mean that black miasma?

332
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:34,191
Yes. I'll purify it.

333
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,101
As expected of Nin.

334
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,499
That's nothing.

335
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:46,294
This monster's biological structure

336
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:51,191
feels different from all the monsters
I've encountered to date.

337
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,696
It's almost like it's being controlled
by its magic element.

338
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:03,249
Are you all right?

339
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:05,396
Rud!

340
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:06,384
Mister Vild!

341
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:08,587
Father, are you all right?

342
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,971
Leader!

343
00:18:09,972 --> 00:18:12,091
Sorry, I was in a haste to defeat it.

344
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,712
Watch out!

345
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:16,004
"Taunt"!

346
00:18:18,105 --> 00:18:19,389
Those who can cast magic,

347
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,095
concentrate your healing spells on me!

348
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:23,201
Understood.

349
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:30,337
Rud!

350
00:18:32,384 --> 00:18:33,404
Everyone,

351
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,697
use this chance to attack it.

352
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:37,389
I'll take on

353
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:39,577
all the enemy's attacks!

354
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:49,894
Everyone has taken a lot of damage.

355
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:51,696
Luna, we're up.

356
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:52,394
Got it.

357
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:59,304
That's my Nin and Luna.

358
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,399
Master!

359
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,096
We'll keep healing you,

360
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:03,701
so go all out!

361
00:19:04,301 --> 00:19:05,900
Everyone, full attack!

362
00:19:07,097 --> 00:19:10,795
I have a skill called "Sacrificial Shield"

363
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:12,693
that transfers all damage
taken by my allies to myself.

364
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:16,081
-With that skill...
-Rud would be the strongest tank there is!

365
00:19:16,082 --> 00:19:17,800
Which means we can go all out

366
00:19:17,801 --> 00:19:18,816
without worrying about its attacks.

367
00:19:19,295 --> 00:19:19,796
Exactly.

368
00:19:19,797 --> 00:19:21,087
All right.

369
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:22,587
Let's do this!

370
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:35,706
It's fleeing.

371
00:19:36,607 --> 00:19:37,690
Don't let it get away!

372
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:38,493
This is bad.

373
00:19:38,493 --> 00:19:39,988
It's headed for the town.

374
00:19:43,785 --> 00:19:45,196
A wall sprung up from the ground?

375
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:46,301
Luna!

376
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:48,389
Good.

377
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,993
I'll put all the 20,000 damage
I've taken so far

378
00:19:56,051 --> 00:19:57,593
into this blow.

379
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:00,999
"Life Conversion"!

380
00:20:13,988 --> 00:20:15,988
I overdid it!

381
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:19,190
I might have caused more damage

382
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:21,701
than the monster…

383
00:20:21,702 --> 00:20:22,988
Rud,

384
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:24,993
thanks to you,

385
00:20:24,993 --> 00:20:26,701
we were able to defeat the monster
without any injuries.

386
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:28,102
You have my thanks.

387
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,521
Thank goodness.

388
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:07,602
So it's a C-rank Black Wolf?

389
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,697
But no matter how I think about it,
it felt like it had the power of A-rank.

390
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:15,191
It had two magical stones?

391
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:17,107
That's unusual.

392
00:22:17,108 --> 00:22:20,695
Monsters that can use magic
typically carry magic stones,

393
00:22:20,696 --> 00:22:21,899
but normally, it's only one.

394
00:22:22,637 --> 00:22:23,904
Master, these magic stones

395
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,388
look like the ones used
to create Homunculi.

396
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,471
In other words,

397
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:30,741
someone embedded magic stones

398
00:22:30,742 --> 00:22:33,004
meant to create Homunculi
into the body of a monster?

399
00:22:33,806 --> 00:22:34,979
Look at that.

400
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,606
Those are stitch marks.

401
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:43,498
Which means this monster
was artificially created?

402
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:44,623
Yes.

403
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:48,816
This means someone tried to apply
Homunculi technology to a monster.

404
00:22:48,816 --> 00:22:49,650
But

405
00:22:49,651 --> 00:22:53,802
isn't it illegal to create
combat-type Homunculi in the first place?

406
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:58,198
Even if it's prohibited, there are always
those curious enough to try it.

407
00:22:58,199 --> 00:22:59,400
That's true.

408
00:22:59,895 --> 00:23:00,924
In the neighbouring country,

409
00:23:00,925 --> 00:23:03,994
there's a factory
where all the employees are Homunculi.

410
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:05,593
But

411
00:23:05,594 --> 00:23:07,218
if they're not just interested,

412
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,807
and are creating these things
for some purpose…

413
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:12,208
In any case,

414
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:14,393
let's report this to the lord.

415
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:19,564
Little did we know that the appearance
of this monster carrying two magic stones

416
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:22,318
was merely a prelude
to the events that followed.
