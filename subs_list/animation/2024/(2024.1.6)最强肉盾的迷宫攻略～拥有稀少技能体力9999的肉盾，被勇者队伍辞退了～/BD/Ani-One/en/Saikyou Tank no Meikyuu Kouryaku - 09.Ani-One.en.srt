1
00:00:03,598 --> 00:00:04,499
Aw.

2
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:07,297
Are you already turning back?

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,205
Who's there?

4
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:18,809
She's emitting such an intense aura…
Who is this girl?

5
00:00:19,705 --> 00:00:21,102
Rud, this is bad!

6
00:00:25,004 --> 00:00:26,097
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:26,801 --> 00:00:30,395
Did I set it so that
Dark Skeletons would continue to spawn?

8
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:32,500
Set?

9
00:00:32,996 --> 00:00:34,701
If we get attacked
by four of them at once…

10
00:00:37,807 --> 00:00:39,020
She took all of them down in one hit.

11
00:00:43,202 --> 00:00:44,301
I didn't expect

12
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:46,699
a demon lord-class guardian would appear.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,803
Demon lord-class?

14
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,698
I thought

15
00:00:51,401 --> 00:00:54,007
I'd already disabled that.

16
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:57,706
Is this girl the labyrinth guardian?

17
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,905
Surrender yourself to my Demon Eye!

18
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:18,048
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:23,800
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

20
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,896
What's with
this ridiculously powerful magic?

21
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,199
But I can still handle this much.

22
00:02:43,005 --> 00:02:47,108
You actually managed to get out of that
without a status ailment.

23
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,900
God's skill is indeed something.

24
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,802
Are you the guardian of this labyrinth?

25
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:54,204
Correct.

26
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,006
But you don't seem intimidated

27
00:02:56,006 --> 00:02:57,803
by me at all.

28
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:01,111
After all, you look like a cute girl.

29
00:03:03,203 --> 00:03:04,655
Cute?

30
00:03:04,655 --> 00:03:06,690
My, you have such a way with words.

31
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:08,104
Don't be fooled, Rud!

32
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,114
She's a 300-year-old granny!

33
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,594
Silence, Marius!

34
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:16,402
You are but a fallen demon lord!

35
00:03:17,302 --> 00:03:18,800
Marius is my friend.

36
00:03:19,797 --> 00:03:21,208
I ask that you do not harm him.

37
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,099
I see.

38
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,000
The fallen demon lord
has joined the likes of human.

39
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,300
Not exactly.

40
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,504
I simply dislike
the rest of you demon lords.

41
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,407
I see…

42
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:38,300
Regardless,

43
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,911
do not get in my way, Demon Lord Marius.

44
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:44,905
You should be aware
that you are no match for me.

45
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:49,689
Marius might not be able
to take you down on his own,

46
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:52,804
but you're up against more

47
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:53,701
than just him.

48
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,901
And?

49
00:03:57,901 --> 00:04:02,106
Your powers are far
from those of a demon lord.

50
00:04:02,997 --> 00:04:05,801
It's true that alone,
a human's power is nothing to fear.

51
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,397
We can't conquer labyrinths alone.

52
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,297
That is why we form parties.

53
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:13,301
To raid them together?

54
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:16,589
Then let's see if you can defeat me,
the guardian of the Caird Labyrinth,

55
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,796
Amos Rose,

56
00:04:18,797 --> 00:04:22,501
with your so-called teamwork.

57
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:25,507
Foolish humans!

58
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:27,997
Such powerful magic!

59
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:29,901
We just have to take her on.

60
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:32,193
"Sacrificial Shield"!

61
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:36,091
"Taunt"!

62
00:04:40,102 --> 00:04:41,206
Such power…

63
00:04:47,506 --> 00:04:48,807
How dare you hurt my sister!

64
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:52,106
She deflected it with a tornado.

65
00:04:52,696 --> 00:04:53,902
Even with "Taunt,"

66
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:56,605
she won't focus only on me.

67
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,299
Although it's impressive,

68
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,203
this level of attack won't hurt me at all.

69
00:05:02,704 --> 00:05:04,602
Then we'll keep attacking until we do.

70
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:06,312
I can easily evade

71
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:08,306
that kind of attack with wind magic…

72
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:10,501
Don't think you can stay
in the air forever!

73
00:05:10,502 --> 00:05:11,502
That hurt…

74
00:05:12,102 --> 00:05:13,903
What a nuisance…

75
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:22,004
Her physical strength is no joke.

76
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:23,600
How do we break through?

77
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,599
Don't worry, I can keep up with her.

78
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,503
Is this the extent of your abilities?

79
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:29,904
"Taunt"!

80
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:32,396
What's the matter?

81
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:36,099
You won't get me
with those random attacks.

82
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,401
I'm not attacking randomly.

83
00:05:40,093 --> 00:05:41,711
Flash magic stone!

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,510
What's that? It's blinding!

85
00:05:49,606 --> 00:05:50,502
How about that?

86
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,012
What is that?

87
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:58,802
Is this tempest the result
of the magic overflow from earlier?

88
00:05:59,496 --> 00:06:02,001
It appears I was careless.

89
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:05,015
My apologies.

90
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,295
Nin, heal everyone up.

91
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:11,512
Got it.

92
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:13,706
I'll also cast some buffs.
Gather around, everyone.

93
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:15,500
That girl is on
an entirely different level

94
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,404
from the monsters

95
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:18,710
we've faced before.

96
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,300
Yeah.

97
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:24,399
But as long as we stand united,
no monster is our match.

98
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,700
I will fight hard
for Master and Lady Manicia.

99
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:30,208
Me too.

100
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:31,696
Same here, of course.

101
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:32,602
Count me in.

102
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:35,005
After all, this is a chance
to defeat a demon lord.

103
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:38,195
Great.

104
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:39,891
We'll attack once the storm calms.

105
00:06:48,103 --> 00:06:49,105
A wolf?

106
00:06:49,804 --> 00:06:51,495
It looks just like a Fenrir.

107
00:06:57,203 --> 00:06:59,202
Marius, can you fight
in your monster form?

108
00:06:59,799 --> 00:07:02,505
If you don't mind me
attacking indiscriminately.

109
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,704
Suppose it's better
for you to stay in this form then.

110
00:07:08,692 --> 00:07:09,596
This will reduce her chances

111
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,299
of attacking the other attackers.

112
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:19,104
Next, let's see how long I can hold up

113
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,902
against this giant monster.

114
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:27,401
That hardly did any damage to her.

115
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,093
Her fur is as tough as an armour.

116
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:31,701
Keep your eyes on me!

117
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:36,307
Those fangs are no joke.

118
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,490
But her attacks
have gotten much simpler.

119
00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:42,105
My shield force is draining fast
because of the consecutive hits.

120
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:43,701
Prepare to cast long-distance magic.

121
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,701
Doesn't seem very effective.

122
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:53,406
It's a battle against the guardian.

123
00:07:53,407 --> 00:07:55,608
We've been prepared for this
to be a long fight.

124
00:07:57,795 --> 00:08:00,290
Her attacks are actually getting stronger!

125
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,694
Dang, I can't catch a break.

126
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:06,402
Sorry, Rud.

127
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,500
Took me some time

128
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,109
to gather my strength.

129
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,305
You're good, don't worry about it.

130
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:13,884
He actually cut through that fur armour.

131
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:15,310
As expected of Marius.

132
00:08:20,194 --> 00:08:21,508
Why is she howling?

133
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:24,703
Rud, just in case,

134
00:08:24,703 --> 00:08:27,005
I'm casting three spells
that'll nullify status ailments.

135
00:08:27,593 --> 00:08:30,203
But I won't be able to heal you guys
in the meantime, so be careful.

136
00:08:30,204 --> 00:08:31,201
Got it.

137
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,198
Rud, are you okay?

138
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:39,707
I'm fine.
My shield force seems to be holding up.

139
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:42,307
As long as I don't go down,

140
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:44,206
with their strength, we won't lose.

141
00:08:44,207 --> 00:08:45,415
We have to keep pushing through.

142
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:55,002
I'll persist until the end.

143
00:09:09,312 --> 00:09:10,406
"Taunt"!

144
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:13,705
She's resilient.

145
00:09:13,705 --> 00:09:15,502
But her movements
are starting to slow down.

146
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:19,505
What's going on?

147
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:22,495
What's with that green gust?

148
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:23,802
Whatever it is,

149
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:26,114
I'll slice it apart!

150
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:28,995
Marius!

151
00:09:29,643 --> 00:09:31,104
Judging from that attack,

152
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,509
it seems to be a wind barrier
that slashes anyone who comes near it.

153
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:37,607
The magic stone on her forehead

154
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,895
didn't shine so brightly

155
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:41,293
before she put up the barrier.

156
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:43,001
Maybe if we destroy that stone,

157
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:44,808
we'll be able to defeat her.

158
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:45,401
But

159
00:09:45,402 --> 00:09:46,899
we can't get close to her at all
with that gust.

160
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:49,905
Nin, use your magic to cancel it.

161
00:09:49,905 --> 00:09:52,192
After that, we'll attack together.

162
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,108
Got it.

163
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,003
In the radiance of the holy light,

164
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,193
the power of darkness…

165
00:09:57,892 --> 00:09:59,510
We need to buy time for Nin.

166
00:10:05,001 --> 00:10:06,797
Quietly emerging within

167
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:08,089
the unseen brilliance of white waves…

168
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,914
It's getting hard to breathe

169
00:10:09,914 --> 00:10:11,794
because of the wind.

170
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:13,801
Just that alone is hard enough,

171
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:16,108
and we've still got to deal
with the wind blades.

172
00:10:16,109 --> 00:10:17,198
This is hell…

173
00:10:17,598 --> 00:10:19,486
With the light of mercy
shining into the darkness…

174
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:21,100
-Even so, I have to hold on.
-dissipate in silence.

175
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:22,602
Prepare yourselves!

176
00:10:22,602 --> 00:10:24,201
If we're attacked…

177
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,002
She's trying to stop us
from getting closer.

178
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,098
Render it all void!

179
00:10:31,599 --> 00:10:33,209
Cease your pointless struggle.

180
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:38,599
I've removed the wind barrier.

181
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,103
Destroy the stone now!

182
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,603
You won't escape!

183
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:50,607
She blocked all the attacks
on the magic stone.

184
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,496
But in doing so,
she also left her chest vulnerable.

185
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,405
Get her, Rud!

186
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,899
My shield force has been depleted by
almost 30,000.

187
00:10:59,505 --> 00:11:00,410
Take this!

188
00:11:01,103 --> 00:11:03,098
"Life Conversion"!

189
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:07,901
That's…

190
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:10,903
different from a barrier.

191
00:11:12,295 --> 00:11:14,009
That's offensive wind magic!

192
00:11:14,896 --> 00:11:16,606
Everyone, dodge!

193
00:11:18,396 --> 00:11:19,303
Oh, no!

194
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,210
That's the sound of the shield breaking.

195
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,417
Rud!

196
00:11:29,813 --> 00:11:32,304
I must hold on…

197
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:36,695
If I use up all my shield force

198
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,805
and get seriously injured,

199
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,200
I'll die!

200
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,499
Rud…

201
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:52,207
Has it stopped?

202
00:11:53,099 --> 00:11:54,303
Rud, are you all right?

203
00:11:55,098 --> 00:11:56,610
Yeah, I barely made it through.

204
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:58,806
Lilia!

205
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:00,998
Marius!

206
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:01,789
Lilia!

207
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,913
Hang in there!

208
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Rud…

209
00:12:07,805 --> 00:12:09,694
Thank goodness you two are still alive.

210
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:17,805
Luna, Nin,

211
00:12:17,805 --> 00:12:19,096
heal them.

212
00:12:19,096 --> 00:12:20,096
They'll be killed

213
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:21,104
if she launches another attack.

214
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,910
You've used up all your shield force.

215
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,000
It's too dangerous.

216
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,317
I can still use my skills without it.

217
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:28,108
I can still fight.

218
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:30,994
Besides, I'm the only one here
who can stop her.

219
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:32,791
Got it.

220
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:34,601
Luna. Lily.

221
00:12:35,691 --> 00:12:37,693
Moreover, I'm the one who selfishly

222
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:39,100
dragged everyone here.

223
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:40,801
They came because of me.

224
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:43,301
It's my responsibility
to protect all of them.

225
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,187
I'm feeling the pain without the shield…

226
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,407
At this rate, I'm going to be crushed!

227
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:56,302
Wind magic?

228
00:12:57,993 --> 00:12:58,894
No?

229
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,210
She can't use any more magic.

230
00:13:05,305 --> 00:13:06,601
She's weak.

231
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,294
We're so close…

232
00:13:10,102 --> 00:13:11,214
I hate to say it,

233
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:12,612
but we'll have to retreat for now…

234
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:14,411
I can still fight.

235
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:18,816
Nin, Luna, prepare your magic.

236
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:20,511
From now on,

237
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,593
I'll be the attacker.

238
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,499
Lily, what are you saying?

239
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,298
I'll use "Fusion" and take Lilia's place.

240
00:13:29,298 --> 00:13:30,695
She's been weakened.

241
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:31,990
All it takes is a little more
and we will defeat her.

242
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:32,697
But…

243
00:13:32,698 --> 00:13:33,600
Rud,

244
00:13:33,601 --> 00:13:36,504
you said you'd listen to my request.

245
00:13:36,504 --> 00:13:38,195
I can still fight!

246
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,491
What a reckless one.

247
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:43,512
I understand.

248
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:44,899
I'll block all the attacks.

249
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,074
I'll help too.

250
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,997
Let's take her down with all we have!

251
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,098
Yes!

252
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:54,284
I didn't realise how much power I'd lose

253
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:56,490
without my shield.

254
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:58,113
But

255
00:13:58,807 --> 00:14:00,089
I've got to buy her time.

256
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,493
Rud!

257
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:06,499
Thanks, Nin.

258
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,507
Lily, are you ready?

259
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:11,307
Ready.

260
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:17,502
I'm not done yet.

261
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,608
Rud!

262
00:14:26,288 --> 00:14:29,702
Her speed isn't too different
from when Lilia's in control,

263
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,407
but unlike her,

264
00:14:31,408 --> 00:14:32,788
Lily's moves are too simple.

265
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,207
They're too predictable.

266
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,094
Sorry.

267
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,806
I'm not used to this body yet.

268
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,588
In that case,

269
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,423
fight as you usually do.

270
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,795
Lilia's out cold anyway.

271
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,009
Don't worry about her.

272
00:14:48,407 --> 00:14:50,705
Fight in your own way.

273
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,182
My own way?

274
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,586
I'll do my best to buy you time
until you get used to it.

275
00:14:56,182 --> 00:14:57,901
So take your time.

276
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,191
Got it.

277
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,676
Although,

278
00:15:02,677 --> 00:15:06,155
given the current situation,
it's a tall order,

279
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:10,213
but my comrade
is fighting so hard to change.

280
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:12,818
So, it's my job

281
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:13,903
to support her.

282
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,566
Rud!

283
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:18,626
Curses.

284
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,793
In my current state,

285
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,698
it's really hard for me
to do my job as the tank.

286
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:24,707
I think I'm going
to pass out from the pain…

287
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,517
No, these are just excuses.

288
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,700
No matter what happens,

289
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:32,589
it's my job to protect my party.

290
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:38,103
Marius used mana as his shield force.

291
00:15:38,816 --> 00:15:40,208
If I do the same,

292
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,101
maybe I can continue to fight.

293
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,698
Rud, she's heading towards you!

294
00:15:47,602 --> 00:15:49,615
It's not perfect, but it worked.

295
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,794
Still, this isn't enough.

296
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:55,396
I need to focus my mana

297
00:15:55,397 --> 00:15:56,592
and transform it into my shield force!

298
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:02,000
I can move more agilely,
just like when I still had my shield force.

299
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,307
The pain in my arm is fading too.

300
00:16:05,112 --> 00:16:06,307
So that's how you do it.

301
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,511
She sped up her attacks.

302
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,807
Is she getting anxious?

303
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:15,397
Unleash more mana.

304
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,585
I can move as freely as I did

305
00:16:18,586 --> 00:16:20,511
when I had my shield force surrounding me.

306
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,396
It's time for the counterattack!

307
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:25,599
Lily, now!

308
00:16:26,398 --> 00:16:27,896
This is different from Lilia.

309
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:30,516
This is my way of fighting!

310
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,307
What power!

311
00:16:37,501 --> 00:16:40,295
Did she enchant the sword
with all elements?

312
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:44,404
Let's end it with this!

313
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:48,696
She's planning to strike
with all four elements at once!

314
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:10,212
Lily! Are you okay?

315
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:11,711
I'm okay…

316
00:17:11,712 --> 00:17:14,199
Thank you, Rud.

317
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,008
That's my line.

318
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,292
We won today because of you.

319
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,498
It wasn't just me.

320
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,802
Now, take a little break.

321
00:17:29,896 --> 00:17:30,897
Amos,

322
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,208
do you want to continue?

323
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,596
I cannot even move anymore.

324
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,097
You put up an excellent fight.

325
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,401
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be defeated.

326
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:43,503
I'm looking for a magic stone
that can grant any wish.

327
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,589
Do you know anything about that?

328
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,797
Here, take it.

329
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,705
Thanks.

330
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:55,902
Never expected my opponent to thank me.
That is a surprise indeed.

331
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,907
Well? Are you not
going to deliver the final blow?

332
00:17:58,908 --> 00:18:03,108
Or are you perhaps the type
that enjoys tormenting pretty girls?

333
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:06,402
You said you were a demon lord.

334
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:08,517
Are there
any other demon lords besides you?

335
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:11,104
Of course.

336
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:13,094
Though, I do not know the exact number.

337
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,410
What is their objective?

338
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:19,098
Among demon lords, there is a popular game

339
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,702
of how to destroy this world.

340
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:31,509
And what is your goal?

341
00:18:32,202 --> 00:18:34,808
Do you seek to be an enemy
of the humans as a demon lord?

342
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:37,409
Or do you just want
to fight strong opponents?

343
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,708
You have an intention.

344
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,353
Yes.

345
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,081
Speak away.

346
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:46,205
Will you help us?

347
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,194
If the demon lords

348
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,839
are coming after the humans,

349
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,467
I plan to gather forces strong enough
to resist them.

350
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,301
Then simply put a slave bracelet on me
and make me obey your command.

351
00:18:58,301 --> 00:19:00,387
I don't like
to force others against their will.

352
00:19:00,982 --> 00:19:02,382
That's why I'm asking
for your cooperation.

353
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,789
An amusing one you are, indeed.

354
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,192
Well, I'm not particularly
attached to my identity as a demon lord.

355
00:19:11,738 --> 00:19:14,514
Rather,
since you have extended an invitation,

356
00:19:16,003 --> 00:19:18,494
I shall gladly become your ally.

357
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:20,993
Thank you.

358
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:23,504
Now, let's return to the city…

359
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:25,304
What's the matter?

360
00:19:25,305 --> 00:19:27,208
I am tired.

361
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,905
I can't take another step. Carry me.

362
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:31,512
Eh?

363
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:32,988
And thus,

364
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:34,795
we successfully persuaded Amos Rose,

365
00:19:34,796 --> 00:19:37,589
the guardian of Caird Labyrinth,
to join our forces.

366
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:39,505
After that,

367
00:19:39,506 --> 00:19:42,198
the two major clans held another ball.

368
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:43,011
And I…

369
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:47,186
We've successfully raided Caird Labyrinth.

370
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,504
Is this the map of the 51st floor?

371
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:50,648
You're kidding!

372
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,858
In exchange for this map and information,

373
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,590
I request an alliance with the two clans.

374
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,364
I announced that in front of everyone.

375
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,116
Of course,

376
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:02,695
I didn't reveal that the guardian
had become our ally.

377
00:20:03,784 --> 00:20:06,189
After successfully forming an alliance
with the two major clans,

378
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,118
we embarked on our journey
back to Avancier.

379
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,600
I want to see Manicia soon…

380
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:13,231
Rud.

381
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:15,309
Rud.

382
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:17,106
Li…

383
00:20:17,106 --> 00:20:20,199
Shh. You'll wake everyone.

384
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:24,307
Thank you for your help
in the labyrinth battle.

385
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:26,683
It's nothing. And I told you, didn't I?

386
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,186
It was thanks to you…

387
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:31,406
We won because of everyone's efforts.

388
00:20:31,407 --> 00:20:32,284
But

389
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:34,503
it was thanks to you
that I could fight until the end.

390
00:20:37,188 --> 00:20:38,415
Thank you.

391
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,108
I'm going back to sleep.

392
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:45,207
What was that about?

393
00:20:45,207 --> 00:20:46,498
And she fell asleep right away.

394
00:20:47,794 --> 00:20:48,997
I'll just have to ask her later

395
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,206
what that kiss meant.

396
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,100
I should just sleep…

397
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:52,900
Rud.

398
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:55,171
Lilia!

399
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:56,816
Did she see that?

400
00:20:57,592 --> 00:20:59,798
Thank you for what you did
in the labyrinth.

401
00:21:00,485 --> 00:21:02,636
I heard your voice.

402
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,246
That's all.

403
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,769
After arriving in Avancier,

404
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,097
we rushed to Manicia.

405
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,942
Manicia, use this magic stone.

406
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:17,808
How do you feel?

407
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:21,205
I feel so much better.

408
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:22,946
Thank you so much,

409
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,992
Miss Amos.

410
00:21:26,503 --> 00:21:29,918
There's not much I can do for you,

411
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,999
but I'll put my best effort
into preparing three meals

412
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,884
and afternoon tea for you.

413
00:21:34,885 --> 00:21:36,878
So, please enjoy yourself

414
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,215
during your stay here.

415
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:44,715
Being warmly welcomed
by such a lovely human is a delight.

416
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,491
And the snacks are delicious too.

417
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:52,728
I shall remain in this town
for the time being.
