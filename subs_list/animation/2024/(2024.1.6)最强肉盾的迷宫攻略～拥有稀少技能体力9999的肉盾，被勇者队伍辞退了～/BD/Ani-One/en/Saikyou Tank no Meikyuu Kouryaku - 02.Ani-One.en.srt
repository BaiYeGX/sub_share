1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:07,758
So this is Avancier?

2
00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:09,755
It's a peaceful town.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,303
That's right.

4
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:12,703
There isn't much going on
in the countryside,

5
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:13,680
but it's a good place to settle down.

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:16,767
I hope you come to like it too.

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,375
Rud!

8
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,708
How long are you staying this time?

9
00:00:24,104 --> 00:00:27,995
If you're not in a hurry,
let's take a day just for ourselves.

10
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:31,281
Rud.

11
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,492
I didn't know you were returning today.

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,395
It's been a while, you two.

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,292
What brings you to these parts?

14
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,670
I was on my way to buy a hammer.

15
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,072
Fil was patrolling.

16
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:48,449
Yes.

17
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,470
I checked in on Manicia.

18
00:00:50,471 --> 00:00:51,708
She is doing well.

19
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:53,500
I see.

20
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,639
Thank you.

21
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,100
It's thanks to the townsfolk
keeping an eye out for my sister

22
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,145
that I can go on adventures without worry.

23
00:01:02,004 --> 00:01:03,104
No need to thank us.

24
00:01:03,861 --> 00:01:05,396
By the way, who is the little girl?

25
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,110
She's Luna.
I met her during my adventures.

26
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,010
She didn't have a place to go,

27
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:13,198
so I figured I'd let her
stay with me for the time being.

28
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,312
I see.

29
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:17,828
Hello there, Luna.

30
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:20,500
I'm the poster girl
for the blacksmith, Milena.

31
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:21,790
Nice to meet you.

32
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:24,911
Your turn.

33
00:01:25,697 --> 00:01:29,071
My name is Fil.

34
00:01:29,072 --> 00:01:32,192
I'm the vice leader
of the town's vigilante corps.

35
00:01:33,884 --> 00:01:35,469
Fil is shy.

36
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,554
Don't out me like that, Rud!

37
00:01:57,226 --> 00:02:02,064
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

38
00:02:02,065 --> 00:02:06,901
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

39
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,492
My little sister might be sleeping.

40
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:24,121
We have to be quiet
so we don't wake her up.

41
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:26,706
This smell…

42
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,210
These are my favourite tomato dishes.

43
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,133
Big Brother, welcome home.

44
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,097
Who is this?

45
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:50,120
Who is this?

46
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:53,312
I'm home, Manicia!

47
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:57,467
This is Luna. I met her along my way back.

48
00:03:57,468 --> 00:03:59,322
She ran into some trouble,

49
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,074
so I decided
to bring her back here for now.

50
00:04:01,715 --> 00:04:02,868
I see.

51
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:05,954
It's been so long
since I last saw Manicia.

52
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,330
She's still as cute as ever.

53
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,583
For a moment,
I thought a goddess had appeared.

54
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,489
It's nice to meet you, Miss Luna.

55
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,292
I'm Manicia.

56
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:17,063
It isn't anything fancy,

57
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:18,383
but please make yourself at home.

58
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,136
Thank you…

59
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:22,429
All right.

60
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,122
Big Brother, you've had a long journey.
You must be tired.

61
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:27,184
Have a seat and eat.

62
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:30,854
I'll prepare another portion.

63
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,276
Wait.

64
00:04:32,277 --> 00:04:34,190
Your body is frail.
You shouldn't push yourself.

65
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,027
I feel perfectly fine today,
so I'll be all right.

66
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,071
Why don't we prepare it together, then?

67
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,824
I suppose. Let's do that, then.

68
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:44,784
Um…

69
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,370
Lady Manicia's hair…

70
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:49,832
Is this your first time seeing
someone with unique abilities?

71
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,502
For Manicia, it's her hair.

72
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:56,520
Her hair moves according to her mood.

73
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:57,965
I see.

74
00:04:58,965 --> 00:04:59,799
Manicia,

75
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,843
seems like you knew I was coming home.

76
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,262
Is that the effect of the skill?

77
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,322
Well, something like that.

78
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:11,044
Even so, you prepared
my favourite dishes for me.

79
00:05:11,817 --> 00:05:13,605
I'm so touched I could cry.

80
00:05:14,276 --> 00:05:15,523
You silly.

81
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,110
You two are very close.

82
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,029
Isn't this normal?

83
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,202
Big Brother, please start helping.

84
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,916
I'm digging in.

85
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,335
Miss Luna.

86
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,672
The way you hold your spoon
is peculiar indeed.

87
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:42,055
I… I'm sorry…

88
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,054
I've only ever used it a few times…

89
00:05:56,688 --> 00:05:57,964
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,234
I'll do better.

91
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,737
-Luna.
-It's not necessary to apologise.

92
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:10,078
You hold a spoon like this.

93
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:19,421
I'll teach you.

94
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,381
Let's take it one step at a time.

95
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:26,495
Thank you very much…

96
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,653
Sir Rud. Lady Manicia.

97
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,697
Good morning.

98
00:06:46,484 --> 00:06:48,864
Did you prepare of all this by yourself?

99
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:49,785
Yes.

100
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:53,788
These are all the dishes Lady Manicia
taught me over the past three days.

101
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:57,250
Delicious!

102
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,128
It tastes exactly like
the way Manicia prepares it.

103
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,504
In only a few days,

104
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,758
Luna's mastered
all the fundamentals of everyday life.

105
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,221
Is this the Homunculus's
astounding learning ability?

106
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,057
Big Brother.

107
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,392
The weather is lovely today.

108
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,937
You should give Miss Luna
a tour of the town.

109
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,981
Good idea.

110
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,410
I'd like to introduce Luna to the townsfolk,
so this is a nice opportunity.

111
00:07:22,411 --> 00:07:25,737
I'll lend her some of my clothes, then.

112
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,657
I have a few sets that she can wear.

113
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:33,453
Manicia is adorable
when she acts like a big sister too.

114
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:37,081
But this one might be
a little difficult to put on.

115
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,959
I'll help you.

116
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:43,838
Sorry…

117
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:46,616
I'll do it myself.

118
00:07:48,296 --> 00:07:51,387
Was it something I did?

119
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,516
That was probably a defensive reflex.

120
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,685
She didn't want Manicia
to see her magic stone.

121
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,150
There is no Adventurers' Guild
or church in Avancier.

122
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:07,904
Only a blacksmith and a pharmacy.

123
00:08:07,905 --> 00:08:09,613
If there's anything
that stands out around here,

124
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,574
it's probably the orchard.

125
00:08:11,975 --> 00:08:13,826
Well, if it isn't Rud.

126
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,788
Here to give me grandchildren
with my daughter?

127
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:19,165
No, Mr. Regil.

128
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,505
Luna, this is Milena's father.

129
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:23,991
I've heard about you from Milena.

130
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:25,463
Nice to meet you, Miss.

131
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,341
Hello…

132
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,176
That reminds me, Mr. Regil…

133
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,095
I see.

134
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,432
You lost your magic sword.

135
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,685
All right.
Seeing as it's a request from Rud,

136
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:42,773
I'll make you a super sword
in the shortest amount of time I can.

137
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,608
Thank you very much.

138
00:08:45,795 --> 00:08:47,509
Mind if I let my daughter help?

139
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:50,967
Her skills are as good as mine.

140
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:52,004
Of course.

141
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:54,660
I'll come back for it when it's ready.

142
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:55,868
Wait.

143
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,330
Why don't you show Luna
the magic greens garden?

144
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:02,521
Simply put,

145
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:04,794
magic greens are magic-fied vegetables.

146
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,671
They're cultivated by magic,

147
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,841
so the harvests
are not restricted by seasons

148
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,718
and they're high in nutritional value.

149
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,887
It's Rud!

150
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:15,972
And he's got a girlfriend with him.

151
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,832
She is not my girlfriend.

152
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,643
Her name is Luna. She's my companion.

153
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,999
Now that I think about it,
Rud probably can't get a girlfriend anyway.

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,354
He has a sister complex, after all.

155
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,983
Where did you learn
an archaic term like that?

156
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:29,402
From Fil.

157
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,114
You boys!

158
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,158
What are you kids doing here?

159
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,999
Back to work in the fields!

160
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,008
It's Granny Gigi!

161
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,009
You're as healthy as ever.

162
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:55,262
Oh, it's Rud.

163
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,850
Your girlfriend?

164
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,018
No.

165
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,687
Luna, this is Granny Gigi.

166
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,899
She's the town pharmacist.

167
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:10,401
She's made a lot of medicines for Manicia.

168
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,946
Let's get along, Luna.

169
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,948
Yes…

170
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:19,702
She reminds me of how Manicia used to be.

171
00:10:23,816 --> 00:10:24,624
Yes.

172
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,878
I wish I could do more to help,

173
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,087
but medicines alone

174
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,901
aren't enough to cure
the root of her illness.

175
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:33,841
You've already done a lot to help us.

176
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,050
Thanks to you,

177
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,928
our lives are much better now.

178
00:10:37,402 --> 00:10:38,402
Is that so?

179
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:40,703
And you too, Luna.
If you ever need any help,

180
00:10:40,703 --> 00:10:42,642
come to my pharmacy.

181
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,312
You children are all like my own.

182
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,731
Oh, right.

183
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,233
I'm on my way to harvest some spinach.

184
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,402
Would you like to join me?

185
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:56,239
Rud, you finally brought a woman back?

186
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,949
No more sister complex for you?

187
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:03,412
All right. Behave.

188
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:25,604
Sorry.

189
00:11:26,359 --> 00:11:27,770
It's a small town,

190
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,939
so gossip is about
the only entertainment around here.

191
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,233
I don't mind.

192
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,275
Well,

193
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,671
it's probably because
you look like a sweet girl

194
00:11:34,672 --> 00:11:36,529
so they can't help but fawn over you.

195
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:38,864
Um, no…

196
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,493
Why… Why don't you try
some of the magic greens we plucked?

197
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:43,369
Good… Good idea.

198
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,958
It's good!

199
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:49,692
I'm glad you like it.

200
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,335
I'm sure everyone
will be happy to hear that.

201
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,922
Avancier is a quiet place

202
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,716
compared to other towns,

203
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,968
but I like it here.

204
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,414
What about you?

205
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,268
The people here are very kind to me.

206
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,286
I'm glad to be in such a nice place.

207
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,525
If I could stay here forever,

208
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,448
I don't know how happy I would be.

209
00:12:22,798 --> 00:12:25,739
Do you feel something in my chest?

210
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,249
It's a magic stone, right?

211
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:32,211
Yes.

212
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,754
You may not believe it,

213
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:37,591
but I am actually not a human.

214
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:40,593
I'm a combat-type Homunculus

215
00:12:41,273 --> 00:12:43,388
developed by the neighbouring country
Brunn Quelez.

216
00:12:44,844 --> 00:12:47,807
I'm sorry for keeping it from you.

217
00:12:48,697 --> 00:12:50,478
Because I didn't want to say it.

218
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,755
I was afraid
that if people knew I was a Homunculus,

219
00:12:53,756 --> 00:12:55,983
I would be destroyed.

220
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:58,653
But

221
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,113
you've helped me so much.

222
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:04,531
I couldn't keep deceiving you…

223
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:07,328
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,790
I've been keeping something from you too.

225
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,167
Actually, I already figured it out.

226
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:15,378
That you were a Homunculus.

227
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,109
I happened to see

228
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,965
the magic stone on you.

229
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:20,675
So,

230
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,109
why are you still helping me?

231
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,805
Before coming here,

232
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,433
Manicia and I used to live in the slums.

233
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:31,144
The look in your eyes

234
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,337
was like Manicia's back then,

235
00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:34,906
and I just couldn't leave you alone.

236
00:13:35,846 --> 00:13:37,008
Even though

237
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,531
we lived in a place like that,

238
00:13:38,536 --> 00:13:40,861
we wanted to live like humans.

239
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,365
What about you, Luna?

240
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,160
Do you want to live like a Homunculus

241
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,286
or do you want to live like a human?

242
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,246
Can you tell me

243
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:53,501
how you really feel?

244
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,587
For a Homunculus like me,

245
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,715
that's wishful thinking.

246
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,633
Is that so?

247
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,513
I've never heard of a rule
that says a Homunculus can't be human.

248
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:08,973
Besides,

249
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,310
I've been raiding labyrinths
for a similar reason.

250
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,355
I've been searching
for the labyrinth treasure

251
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,996
to cure Manicia.

252
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:24,864
We both have unattainable aspirations.

253
00:14:25,995 --> 00:14:27,902
Don't you think that makes us
the perfect friends?

254
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,116
I…

255
00:14:35,797 --> 00:14:37,006
If it's here…

256
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:40,199
If it's by his side…

257
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,944
Maybe my wish could really come true…

258
00:14:45,806 --> 00:14:46,600
I

259
00:14:47,907 --> 00:14:49,610
want to live as a human.

260
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,225
I understand.

261
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,321
Let's get along, Luna.

262
00:14:55,868 --> 00:14:58,616
Yes, Master.

263
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:03,176
Wouldn't calling me "Master"
be too Homunculus-like?

264
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:04,392
Is that so?

265
00:15:05,691 --> 00:15:06,572
But for some reason,

266
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:09,242
I wish to call you that.

267
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,244
I see.

268
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,706
Lady Manicia,

269
00:15:16,211 --> 00:15:17,808
I have something to tell you.

270
00:15:20,401 --> 00:15:21,528
Are you sure about this?

271
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:22,610
Yes.

272
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:25,216
I don't want to hide it
from people I care about anymore.

273
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,219
I am a Homunculus.

274
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:31,612
I am very sorry for hiding it from you.

275
00:15:35,298 --> 00:15:38,694
So that's why you were a little different.

276
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,308
Will you still

277
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:42,108
be my friend?

278
00:15:43,197 --> 00:15:44,204
Of course.

279
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:51,902
You knew, didn't you, Big Brother?

280
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:56,288
Reaching your hand out
to those in need of help…

281
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:58,788
That part of you

282
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,902
hasn't changed at all.

283
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:07,508
Finally done with the cleaning.

284
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:10,408
I'm exhausted.

285
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:11,006
I'm starving.

286
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:13,347
Thank you for your help, Master.

287
00:16:13,902 --> 00:16:15,390
Thank you as well.

288
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,308
Sorry for making you help
with the clean-up too.

289
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:19,312
It's not a problem at all.

290
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,001
Still,

291
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,316
this is a huge estate.

292
00:16:25,011 --> 00:16:28,028
Everyone, I made tea.

293
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:28,970
What?

294
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:31,323
Tea prepared by Manicia?

295
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,202
Lady Manicia is popular indeed.

296
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,913
Huh?

297
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:40,332
I will be the first
to drink Manicia's tea!

298
00:16:45,413 --> 00:16:49,370
Manicia's tea is especially great
when I'm the first to get to drink it.

299
00:16:49,371 --> 00:16:50,844
It's all the same.

300
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,798
Rud, your sister complex
really knows no bounds.

301
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,293
I told you to stop saying that.

302
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,803
Manicia, how are you feeling?

303
00:16:57,804 --> 00:16:59,676
You said you were feeling fine today,

304
00:16:59,677 --> 00:17:00,978
but helping us
with the clean-up is still too much.

305
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:03,105
All I did was made tea.

306
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,965
Big Brother, you worry too much.

307
00:17:04,966 --> 00:17:05,942
But…

308
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,610
My body may be frail,

309
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,022
but I don't want to be a burden to you.

310
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:14,925
Manicia…

311
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,577
I've told you, haven't I?

312
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,705
You're never a burden to me.

313
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,203
Oi, Rud!

314
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:22,749
Since we're done with the clean-up,

315
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,460
why don't we have a nice spar?
It's been a while.

316
00:17:24,891 --> 00:17:26,296
A spar?

317
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:28,214
It's just a friendly spar.

318
00:17:29,297 --> 00:17:30,506
This is the perfect chance for that.

319
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,203
Guys,

320
00:17:32,204 --> 00:17:35,096
can you wait until I've sparred with Fil?

321
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,681
Me?

322
00:17:38,598 --> 00:17:39,891
I see.

323
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,852
You want to test
the effects of your skills

324
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,595
you didn't know about through sparring.

325
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:45,073
That's right.

326
00:17:45,074 --> 00:17:47,149
If it's against the vice leader
of the vigilante corps,

327
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,859
I should be able to go all out.

328
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:53,489
If I weaken your shield force
by a great deal, you lose.

329
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,520
That works, right?

330
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:55,116
Sure.

331
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,328
Get ready.

332
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,646
Begin!

333
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,416
Neither of them moved.

334
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,378
Well, they're not the kind
to win a battle with speed.

335
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:08,521
But

336
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,417
someone still has to make the first move.

337
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,929
That's a heavy blow.

338
00:18:27,115 --> 00:18:28,396
Fil has gotten a lot stronger

339
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:30,803
since we last duelled.

340
00:18:32,432 --> 00:18:34,197
That hit could've seriously taken me out.

341
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,803
Lady Fil is strong.

342
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,159
They may be the vigilante corps,

343
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,931
but the members are mostly
young townspeople who've never left.

344
00:18:41,932 --> 00:18:45,085
So, not everyone is as skilled in combat.

345
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,252
But

346
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:50,337
Miss Fil and Big Brother are exceptions.

347
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:54,884
They're better off
honing their skills in the big cities.

348
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:57,094
I see.

349
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,162
Get him, Fil!

350
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:01,390
We ought to take Rud down sometimes!

351
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,142
Master!

352
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,228
Please do your best!

353
00:19:05,742 --> 00:19:06,770
Big Brother!

354
00:19:10,894 --> 00:19:12,402
You've got a lot of time
to be looking around.

355
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,209
It grazed me, but it's not a big deal.

356
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,999
I can use this damage…

357
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:21,715
Rud's off balance.

358
00:19:21,716 --> 00:19:23,996
Fil, now's your chance!

359
00:19:27,084 --> 00:19:27,750
What?

360
00:19:35,076 --> 00:19:36,506
My shield force was wiped out.

361
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:38,135
Just from that one hit?

362
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:42,389
Has that Rud finally learned
an attack skill?

363
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,433
Doesn't Fil have a shield force
of 2500 or something?

364
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,605
To destroy it in one hit,
just how powerful is that skill?

365
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,720
You've gotten stronger.

366
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:53,022
Still not enough to beat you, though.

367
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:56,362
By the way,

368
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,197
what was that stupendous skill?

369
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:01,609
It's called "Life Conversion".

370
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,290
It allows me to turn

371
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,496
the shield force consumed in battle
into power.

372
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,267
I can't use it anytime I want,

373
00:20:08,268 --> 00:20:09,610
but thanks to this duel,

374
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:13,045
I now know how powerful it is.

375
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:14,589
Thanks.

376
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,557
Glad to be of help.

377
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:20,803
As a tank,

378
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,013
I've always been concentrating on defence.

379
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:24,783
However,

380
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:28,144
thanks to this "Life Conversion" skill,

381
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,688
I'll be able to attack as well.

382
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:33,298
All right. Who's next?

383
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,233
I just remembered I have an emergency…

384
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,887
I think I have a stomach ache.

385
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:39,565
Master, you were incredible.

386
00:20:39,566 --> 00:20:40,614
Yes.

387
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:42,950
Big Brother is amazing.

388
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,120
Compared to him, I…

389
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:50,318
Mama… Papa…

390
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,812
Big Brother…

391
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:53,294
Where are you?

392
00:20:54,314 --> 00:20:56,871
It looks like that girl's been abandoned.

393
00:20:56,872 --> 00:20:58,423
I heard she has an incurable disease.

394
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,969
Seems her parents are only
willing to keep their son, Rud.

395
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,930
I saw them drag him away.

396
00:21:07,413 --> 00:21:10,603
From the looks of it, she won't last long.

397
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,024
Manicia!

398
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:21,322
Thank goodness! So this is where you were.

399
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,401
Big Brother!

400
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,789
It's that dream again.

401
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:36,095
Big Brother always came back for me.

402
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,508
But is he really happy like this?

403
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,970
If it weren't for me,

404
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:51,293
he would be able
to live more freely, wouldn't he?
