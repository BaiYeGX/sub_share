1
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:19,060
In an adventurer party,

2
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,610
there are usually various roles,

3
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,064
such as attackers and healers.

4
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:25,719
I, Rud, am a tank.

5
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,318
As the shield of the party,

6
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,339
my duty is to block enemy attacks

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,762
and protect my party members.

8
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:34,475
It's a role where I play the unsung hero.

9
00:00:35,543 --> 00:00:37,788
This is the story of how
a "little guy" like me

10
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:42,834
becomes the protagonist.

11
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:58,183
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

12
00:00:58,184 --> 00:01:04,832
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

13
00:02:18,558 --> 00:02:20,974
Oh, Big Brother,

14
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,728
you never come back to see me.
I've been so lonely.

15
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,984
Manicia!

16
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:27,981
Rud.

17
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,233
I'm never going anywhere else again.

18
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:31,901
Rud!

19
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,370
What's the big deal, Nin?

20
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,414
I was having a great time in my fantasy…

21
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,843
Don't "what's the big deal" me.

22
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:41,119
Please stop making
weird faces in the guild.

23
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,058
Sheesh.

24
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:48,380
Thinking about your little sister again?

25
00:02:48,381 --> 00:02:49,544
You know me well.

26
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:51,073
We're in the same party, after all.

27
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:52,381
I know that much about you.

28
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:56,009
But you really like
your little sister, huh?

29
00:02:56,454 --> 00:02:58,573
Maybe you should consider
picking up other interests.

30
00:02:58,574 --> 00:02:59,471
Such as?

31
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:03,350
Love… and stuff.

32
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:06,644
Nin, that's…

33
00:03:07,013 --> 00:03:08,339
Wait, Rud, don't get the wrong idea…

34
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,406
But there's no one cuter than Manicia.

35
00:03:10,698 --> 00:03:11,375
That part of you is so irritating.

36
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:14,506
Hey, Rud, I'm serious.

37
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:15,696
Seriously speaking, though,

38
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,241
I've been trying to keep
my mind off of other things.

39
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:23,454
After all, the only way
to save Manicia from her incurable disease

40
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:28,318
is to obtain the labyrinth treasure
capable of granting all wishes.

41
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:30,538
Rud…

42
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:32,212
But

43
00:03:32,218 --> 00:03:34,878
considering my sorry state from yesterday,
forget about the treasure,

44
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,509
I let everyone down.

45
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,344
That's not true.

46
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,056
You did your duty as a tank.

47
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:45,604
I wasn't hit by the enemy,

48
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:47,855
but my shield force's effect decreased.

49
00:03:47,855 --> 00:03:49,572
It wasn't just yesterday either.

50
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:52,015
During the recent labyrinth raids,

51
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:54,401
my shield force has been weakening
without my notice.

52
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:57,487
And I've been using up
a lot of recovery potions too.

53
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,198
That must've put quite
the burden on you, the healer.

54
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:02,117
I'm truly sorry.

55
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,327
What are you talking about?

56
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:07,115
You're the reason we've been able

57
00:04:07,116 --> 00:04:08,290
to come this far.

58
00:04:08,826 --> 00:04:11,960
I know you've been protecting me.

59
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,230
Besides, your shield has 9999 resistance.

60
00:04:16,236 --> 00:04:17,988
That's the highest
we've ever seen, you know?

61
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,384
Nin…

62
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:22,447
You're an excellent tank.

63
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:24,973
So, even if we get new party members,
stand tall and proud, okay?

64
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,224
It's the hero!

65
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,787
I heard he's already managed to conquer
several labyrinths at such a young age.

66
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:32,564
That's the great hero, Kygras, for you.

67
00:04:35,968 --> 00:04:37,359
Yo, Rud.

68
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,058
Sorry, am I late?

69
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,931
No, just in time.

70
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:43,283
Good morning, Lilia, Lily.

71
00:04:44,522 --> 00:04:46,907
Now that the party is all here,

72
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:48,322
let me introduce everyone.

73
00:04:48,323 --> 00:04:48,730
Come over.

74
00:04:49,407 --> 00:04:51,082
These are our new party members.

75
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:53,669
Hold on, Kygras.

76
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,386
What's going on here?

77
00:04:55,386 --> 00:04:56,393
The rule of exploring a labyrinth

78
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:58,011
is that a party can only have
a maximum of six members.

79
00:04:58,011 --> 00:04:59,757
Doesn't this make it seven?

80
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,453
Don't worry.

81
00:05:02,454 --> 00:05:04,363
The party will still have six.

82
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:07,345
Rud, you are dismissed starting today.

83
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:10,894
Why?

84
00:05:13,203 --> 00:05:14,651
Obviously,

85
00:05:14,652 --> 00:05:15,607
-because you failed
-Wind Blast!

86
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,234
-to perform as a tank.
-Water Storm!

87
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:21,422
Life Burst!

88
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:23,995
We did it!

89
00:05:23,996 --> 00:05:27,614
You lost your shield force
entirely yesterday.

90
00:05:27,615 --> 00:05:29,120
That's the problem.

91
00:05:30,318 --> 00:05:31,272
What's going on?

92
00:05:31,784 --> 00:05:32,782
Stop messing around!

93
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:35,220
How can we continue
with such a useless tank?

94
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:36,438
No…

95
00:05:36,798 --> 00:05:37,730
Wait.

96
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:40,158
Rud blocked the attacks,

97
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,771
but the shield still wore off.

98
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:45,053
There must be some other reason behind it.

99
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:48,007
We know it's his skills.

100
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,125
-After all, he has two skills
-This is bad!

101
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:51,735
-with unknown effects.
-Rud, come on!

102
00:05:57,454 --> 00:05:59,734
It's true that not all skills are good,

103
00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:01,735
but

104
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,990
we still don't know for sure
if his skills were the cause of it.

105
00:06:03,991 --> 00:06:04,632
Yet, you're…

106
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:05,534
What on earth are you going on about?

107
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,667
If we weren't careful,
we could've been wiped out.

108
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,496
Isn't that enough reason for me
to dismiss him?

109
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:12,830
Besides, our new party member here

110
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:15,625
is the evasion-type tank
that's all the rage these days.

111
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:18,795
She can even attack while she dodges.

112
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,382
She's a far cry from you,
who can only defend.

113
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:25,677
For all these reasons,

114
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:27,804
you're dismissed.

115
00:06:33,522 --> 00:06:34,444
He was let go.

116
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,981
It can't be helped…

117
00:06:41,537 --> 00:06:42,276
I understand.

118
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,660
Rud…

119
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:52,370
Oi, I'm not finished yet.

120
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:55,739
Because of you,
we didn't get any rewards yesterday.

121
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,064
The highest endurance stats
we've ever seen? Bah.

122
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:02,880
You're just a lousy tank
who can't even use your shield properly.

123
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,138
We know you're capable.

124
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,140
Good luck.

125
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:19,980
I'm sorry.

126
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,083
You invited me to join the party,

127
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:24,308
but it seems
my abilities weren't up to par.

128
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:25,772
That's not true at all!

129
00:07:26,394 --> 00:07:29,324
Rud, are you really leaving?

130
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,234
I told you about the town

131
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,080
my little sister and I live in, right?

132
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:37,343
Avancier, right?

133
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:38,500
What about it?

134
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:41,044
If you want to see me, come find me there.

135
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,171
I won't always be there,

136
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:47,099
but I'm planning on moving back
to live with my sister there permanently.

137
00:07:47,795 --> 00:07:48,359
That's why

138
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:50,220
we'll meet again someday.

139
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,018
But it's not like
I'll be that lonely without you.

140
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,479
I know.

141
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:02,524
I'm looking forward
to the next time we meet again.

142
00:08:07,536 --> 00:08:09,655
So, what should I do now?

143
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,059
-Even though I want to return to Avancier…
-Hurry up and move it.

144
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:16,120
You're just a lousy tank
who can't even use your shield properly.

145
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,248
Was Kygras right?

146
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:21,126
That a skill of mine
was depleting my shield force?

147
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,378
Doesn't that make it a defective skill?

148
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,026
It makes me uneasy, but I don't know
anyone who can appraise it for me.

149
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:30,782
Anyway, are we sure

150
00:08:30,783 --> 00:08:33,009
we can handle this escort mission?

151
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,847
We've all risen to D rank.

152
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:35,932
We can handle it just fine.

153
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:39,978
It should be okay
if it's just until Kurath.

154
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,396
But…

155
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,732
AVANCIER
CURRENT LOCATION: KURATH

156
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:46,192
Excuse me.

157
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,286
He's huge!

158
00:08:48,287 --> 00:08:49,197
About that request,

159
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:50,822
may I join you?

160
00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:53,200
I won't need any payment.

161
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:56,057
Well, what's your adventurer rank?

162
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:59,831
Truth be told, I'm still at rank F

163
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:02,708
because of all the time
I spent in the labyrinths…

164
00:09:03,015 --> 00:09:04,753
Stare…

165
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:06,817
I feel like
I've seen this guy somewhere before.

166
00:09:08,008 --> 00:09:09,149
I remember now!

167
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,634
He was in the hero's party!

168
00:09:12,112 --> 00:09:13,331
Please join us!

169
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:14,804
Actually, I…

170
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:15,514
Everyone.

171
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:19,401
You must be the adventurers
who accepted the request.

172
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:20,392
Yes.

173
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,436
And we have a new party member.

174
00:09:21,865 --> 00:09:22,985
What's your name?

175
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,202
I… I'm Rud.

176
00:09:24,604 --> 00:09:26,461
Mister Rud, yes?

177
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:27,734
I don't mind,

178
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,403
but I can't offer a higher reward.

179
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:33,727
Off we go, then.

180
00:09:33,728 --> 00:09:34,741
Please.

181
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:39,633
I missed the timing to tell them my rank.

182
00:09:39,634 --> 00:09:41,457
I feel bad keeping it from them,

183
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:42,332
but there's no other choice.

184
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,750
I'll ensure their safety

185
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,710
until we get to Kurath.

186
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:00,016
It's foggy.

187
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,269
Let's stop here for the night.

188
00:10:02,642 --> 00:10:04,854
No, we're almost at Kurath, aren't we?

189
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,981
I have a bad feeling about this.

190
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,678
We'd better cross this forest in one go.

191
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:10,183
I understand.

192
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:12,903
As long as we keep
an eye out for ambushes,

193
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,447
we should reach Kurath safely.

194
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:18,093
Please stop the carriage.

195
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:21,412
Is something the matter?

196
00:10:26,187 --> 00:10:27,459
Is it a monster?

197
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,962
It could be bandits or something else.

198
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,338
You guys stay here.

199
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:38,805
You over there!

200
00:10:58,558 --> 00:10:59,617
I don't sense anyone else around.

201
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,411
It doesn't seem to be a trap.

202
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:03,455
Are you all right?

203
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:08,625
There's no need to be scared.

204
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,336
I won't hurt you.

205
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:12,213
Can you stand?

206
00:11:17,668 --> 00:11:18,678
She… She's naked!

207
00:11:20,038 --> 00:11:20,764
A magic stone?

208
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:22,557
Is she…

209
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,812
Mister Rud, monster!

210
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,524
It's the Forest Snake!

211
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,326
It's massive!

212
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:38,656
Find cover.

213
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,119
This snake's venom is highly toxic.

214
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,037
You must be careful.

215
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:46,630
This isn't a monster we can defeat!

216
00:11:46,631 --> 00:11:48,416
Are we going to die here?

217
00:11:51,131 --> 00:11:53,170
Over here, Forest Snake!

218
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,465
"Taunt"!

219
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:07,018
Mister Rud!

220
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:08,060
It's fine.

221
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,855
I have a skill that makes me immune
to status afflictions.

222
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:12,682
I'll distract it

223
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:13,899
so you guys can attack it.

224
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,932
Even if you say that…

225
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:17,070
What should we do?

226
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:18,280
At this rate…

227
00:12:31,861 --> 00:12:32,544
Manicia!

228
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:36,297
Big Brother…

229
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,137
I can't die here.

230
00:12:43,168 --> 00:12:43,846
You guys.

231
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,100
I don't have a sword with me.

232
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,812
We won't be able to defeat this thing
unless you attack.

233
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,857
Grab your weapons and let's move it.

234
00:12:56,307 --> 00:12:57,777
We'll take it down together!

235
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:04,742
As the strongest tank,

236
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,160
I will block

237
00:13:09,363 --> 00:13:10,664
all of its attacks!

238
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,617
So, please,

239
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:14,169
believe in yourselves!

240
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:17,588
You will

241
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:19,716
conquer it!

242
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:23,228
Now!

243
00:13:31,986 --> 00:13:32,629
That's…

244
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:33,896
Watch out!

245
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,481
It's using its ultimate attack!

246
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:38,685
Dodge!

247
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,761
I can't do that.

248
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,252
It's precisely because
it's an ultimate attack

249
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,003
that I must block it.

250
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:55,177
Now!

251
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:11,326
I can't believe
we defeated the Forest Snake!

252
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:13,935
We couldn't have done it on our own.

253
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,646
It's all thanks to Mister Rud.

254
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:18,650
It's because we all did our part.

255
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:20,736
Well, then, I'll leave you
to dismantle the monster.

256
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,487
I'm going to check on the girl.

257
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,907
Got it.

258
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,281
Are you hurt?

259
00:14:30,283 --> 00:14:30,995
No.

260
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:32,830
That's good to hear.

261
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:36,709
You were running away
from that monster, right?

262
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:38,503
What are your plans after this?

263
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,157
Do you have anywhere you can go?

264
00:14:43,042 --> 00:14:45,539
I don't know where I should go…

265
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:46,845
In that case,

266
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,596
will you come with me?

267
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,393
I'm headed to a town named Avancier.

268
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,062
Can I?

269
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:57,855
If you don't mind.

270
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,900
I could never…

271
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:04,988
All right.

272
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,256
But

273
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,200
you can't exactly go around
dressed like that.

274
00:15:10,446 --> 00:15:12,565
If you don't mind,
you can have these clothes.

275
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,173
Are you sure?

276
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,398
Of course.

277
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,939
We'd be dead if it weren't for you.

278
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,376
Consider this a token of my appreciation.

279
00:15:20,103 --> 00:15:21,591
Thank you.

280
00:15:21,592 --> 00:15:23,089
Go get changed over there.

281
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,006
Okay.

282
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,345
Could that child be a runaway slave?

283
00:15:30,956 --> 00:15:33,307
That girl is a Homunculus.

284
00:15:34,557 --> 00:15:36,414
Normally, an enslaved Homunculus

285
00:15:36,415 --> 00:15:39,563
would never act on its own.

286
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:41,983
There might be something going on.

287
00:15:43,162 --> 00:15:46,487
Slave traders usually wouldn't go
through such a dangerous forest.

288
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,988
Plus, she doesn't have a collar on her.

289
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,576
I plan to keep her with me for now.

290
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,248
Thank you for giving us a ride.

291
00:15:57,868 --> 00:16:00,088
Is it all right for us
to drop you off here?

292
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:00,552
Yes.

293
00:16:01,361 --> 00:16:02,962
Well, then, we will take our leave now.

294
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,965
Please wait.

295
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:09,390
Mister Rud,
do you have a party at the moment?

296
00:16:09,982 --> 00:16:11,387
No, I don't.

297
00:16:11,814 --> 00:16:14,440
Then, will you join our party?

298
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:17,768
We'd like to adventure
with a strong tank like you.

299
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,522
I appreciate the invitation,

300
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,191
but I must continue my search
for the labyrinth treasure.

301
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:24,831
As in

302
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:26,883
the treasure that can grant any wish?

303
00:16:26,884 --> 00:16:27,653
And

304
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,472
the power to create Homunculi.

305
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,614
Yes, that's right.

306
00:16:31,601 --> 00:16:33,272
Homunculus, huh?

307
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:35,867
I'm not good at dealing
with the Homunculi.

308
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:38,080
They're always working emotionlessly.

309
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,565
I find that quite unsettling.

310
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,014
But the only difference
between their appearance

311
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:42,877
and ours is the magic stone
embedded in their chests.

312
00:16:43,629 --> 00:16:44,211
Still…

313
00:16:46,228 --> 00:16:47,854
And that's why

314
00:16:47,855 --> 00:16:50,628
I can't join your party. I'm sorry.

315
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:52,554
I see.

316
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:56,724
If it's you,

317
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,809
I'm sure your labyrinth raids
will be successful, Mister Rud.

318
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,412
That reminds me.
I guess I haven't introduced myself yet.

319
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,246
My name is Rud.

320
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,868
Mister Rud…

321
00:17:21,868 --> 00:17:22,875
What's your name?

322
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:29,590
I don't have a name.

323
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:30,383
I see.

324
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,803
Well, it'll be hard
to call you without one.

325
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,431
Those are Lunafia petals.

326
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,310
Luna.

327
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,972
Luna?

328
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:49,277
If you don't like it,
you can change it later.

329
00:17:50,108 --> 00:17:50,778
No, it's fine.

330
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,697
Thank you for giving me a name.

331
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:02,832
Thank you for the food.

332
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,787
We should arrive in Avancier tomorrow.

333
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:06,961
Let's get an early night.

334
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,212
Okay.

335
00:18:29,624 --> 00:18:33,988
So Luna really is
an illegally created Homunculus.

336
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,242
She possesses self-awareness and emotions
that regular Homunculi don't have,

337
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:39,535
and she can even fight.

338
00:18:40,582 --> 00:18:41,796
Normally, illegally created Homunculi

339
00:18:41,797 --> 00:18:44,123
are supposed to be destroyed.

340
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,001
But her terrified expression

341
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,425
reminded me of Manicia,

342
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:49,962
and I couldn't just leave her be.

343
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,090
I'm sorry about the pot.

344
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,402
It's all right.
We've finished eating anyway.

345
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:56,878
That said,

346
00:18:56,879 --> 00:19:00,284
you should've been able to kill
the Forest Snake with your skills, no?

347
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:02,725
I… I'm more proficient in using magic.

348
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:05,603
I don't have any melee skills.

349
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,188
Magic.

350
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:10,482
I wonder if she's able
to imitate and simulate magic skills.

351
00:19:11,175 --> 00:19:12,826
Do you have any magic skills?

352
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:16,013
I have a skill that enhances magic.

353
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:16,883
Anything else?

354
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:18,749
I have a support skill.

355
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,097
It's a skill called "Appraisal".

356
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:22,787
I see. Appraisal, huh?

357
00:19:25,434 --> 00:19:26,665
Appraisal?

358
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:27,625
Yes…

359
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,336
"Appraisal" is an extremely rare skill.

360
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,047
It's said that only one person
in a neighbouring country has this skill.

361
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,799
Unfortunately, that person
passed away a few years ago.

362
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,035
In other words,

363
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:40,436
you're the only one in the world
who has Appraisal now.

364
00:19:40,437 --> 00:19:43,410
I had no idea it was such a prized skill.

365
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:44,850
Luna.

366
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:48,020
Can you help appraise my skills?

367
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:50,433
Of… Of course.

368
00:19:50,434 --> 00:19:51,540
Really?

369
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,458
It's my job, after all.

370
00:19:54,245 --> 00:19:55,069
Now, then,

371
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,650
the skill requires
physical contact with the target,

372
00:19:57,651 --> 00:19:59,052
so please excuse me.

373
00:20:01,812 --> 00:20:03,452
You have four skills, Mister Rud.

374
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,036
First, "Taunt".

375
00:20:06,036 --> 00:20:09,249
It's a skill that attracts as much
attention as possible from the enemy.

376
00:20:10,073 --> 00:20:12,002
Next, "Strong Body".

377
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,904
Not only does it render the bearer
immune from abnormal statuses,

378
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:15,615
but it also enhances your self-recovery

379
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:18,214
and maximises your body's
vitality and strength.

380
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:19,610
I already knew about these two skills.

381
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:21,554
The real deal is what comes after.

382
00:20:22,213 --> 00:20:23,806
Then, you have "Life Conversion".

383
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,475
Life Conversion?

384
00:20:25,911 --> 00:20:27,434
Life Conversion is a skill

385
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,145
that allows you to turn
the shield force consumed in battle

386
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,208
"WEAKENED SHIELD FORCE"
into power.

387
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:32,135
"LIFE CONVERSION ACTIVATED"
So

388
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:33,983
"LIFE CONVERSION ACTIVATED"
it's an offensive skill?

389
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,026
It appears so.

390
00:20:35,974 --> 00:20:39,113
It seems some skills cannot be invoked
until you understand it.

391
00:20:40,219 --> 00:20:40,990
Finally…

392
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:43,659
"Sacrificial Shield".

393
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:45,453
Sacrificial Shield?

394
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:47,749
"ATTACK"
The Sacrifical Shield

395
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,823
allows the wielder to bear the damage

396
00:20:49,823 --> 00:20:51,459
inflicted on their comrades.

397
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:54,628
Moreover, it seems to enhance
the resilience of both the party members

398
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,798
"RESILIENCE UP"
and oneself while protecting the party.

399
00:21:00,437 --> 00:21:02,526
It transfers damage to myself?

400
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:04,263
Yes, that's right.

401
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:08,255
So, the weakening of my shield force

402
00:21:08,256 --> 00:21:09,309
was because I was protecting

403
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,271
and protecting my party members all along?

404
00:21:15,047 --> 00:21:16,353
Is something wrong?

405
00:21:16,354 --> 00:21:17,276
Nothing.

406
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:20,153
It's just that my concern
over my unknown skills

407
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:24,492
that had been troubling me for so long
was resolved so easily.

408
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:27,327
Thank you, Luna.

409
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,746
It's my honour to be of help.

410
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:38,339
I was kicked out of the party
because of the unknown effects

411
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,840
of my skills that I wasn't aware of.

412
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,926
But now I know

413
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,387
that my skills are the most powerful
for protecting my comrades.

414
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,223
Now, I can return home
with my head held high,

415
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,101
back to Avancier,
where my little sister awaits.
