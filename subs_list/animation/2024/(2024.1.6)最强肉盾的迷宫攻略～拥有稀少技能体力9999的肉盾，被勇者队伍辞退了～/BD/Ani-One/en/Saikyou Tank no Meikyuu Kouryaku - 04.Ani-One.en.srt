1
00:00:01,103 --> 00:00:03,189
Nothing in the news today either?

2
00:00:06,797 --> 00:00:08,994
A monster with two magic stones,

3
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:12,096
what could it be?

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,793
Good morning, Big Brother.

5
00:00:15,399 --> 00:00:16,903
Good morning, Manicia.

6
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,898
Will you read the newspaper to me, please?

7
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,101
I thought you were good at reading.

8
00:00:27,004 --> 00:00:28,199
Read to me, please?

9
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,198
A spoiled Manicia

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,899
is too cute!

11
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:38,496
I heard there are
a lot of new labyrinths popping up lately.

12
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:39,790
I see.

13
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:44,204
"Avancier might see
the emergence of a labyrinth too", huh?

14
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,498
Speaking of which, a few days ago…

15
00:00:47,394 --> 00:00:49,706
If we get a labyrinth around here,

16
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:52,399
this town will prosper.

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,905
This one's about
the economic situation in the capital.

18
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:00,303
This one's about the new system.

19
00:01:00,901 --> 00:01:02,500
And this one…

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,896
Former hero Kygras is off
to conquer a new labyrinth.

21
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,498
You used to be in the same party, right?

22
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:10,695
Yes.

23
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,997
Miss Nin said she couldn't stand him

24
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:16,201
because he always looked down on you.

25
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:18,796
Nin's words usually come

26
00:01:18,796 --> 00:01:21,011
with a lot of personal feelings.

27
00:01:21,012 --> 00:01:22,291
That's surprising.

28
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,897
Big Brother, you've noticed
her feelings for you, haven't you?

29
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,297
Did you pretend not to notice

30
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:31,205
because of my illness?

31
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:38,194
It's one of the things I considered,

32
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:40,601
but the real issue lies with me.

33
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:45,202
I'm not strong.

34
00:01:45,202 --> 00:01:47,607
Once I get close to someone,

35
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:49,596
I'll become fixated on that relationship,

36
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,707
and I won't be able to focus
on raiding labyrinths.

37
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:56,103
I'm not skilled.

38
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:58,994
I can't juggle both.

39
00:02:01,097 --> 00:02:03,602
But I think if it were you,
it would be okay.

40
00:02:05,707 --> 00:02:06,406
So,

41
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,893
if someone you care about
shows up one day,

42
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:11,705
please continue to take care of me

43
00:02:12,706 --> 00:02:15,501
while you pursue your happiness.

44
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,199
Sure.

45
00:02:19,403 --> 00:02:20,304
That's a given.

46
00:02:32,102 --> 00:02:35,644
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

47
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:41,862
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

48
00:03:54,904 --> 00:03:55,999
Everyone,

49
00:03:56,698 --> 00:03:58,196
I've gathered you here today

50
00:03:58,803 --> 00:04:03,302
to defeat the Chameleon Kong
that was spotted a few days ago.

51
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:07,801
The Chameleon Kong resides
in a region further south from here,

52
00:04:08,804 --> 00:04:10,393
and it's hard to imagine how it managed

53
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:12,603
to come to Avancier
without being noticed by anyone.

54
00:04:13,495 --> 00:04:15,204
That's why we'll also need

55
00:04:15,205 --> 00:04:18,004
to investigate why it appeared here.

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,401
I'd like to express my gratitude
to all of you for assisting.

57
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:24,988
Incidentally,

58
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:29,102
there are suspicions that the Chameleon Kong
could have escaped from a labyrinth.

59
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:31,298
So, if any of you come across
the entrance to a labyrinth,

60
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:32,696
please report it to us immediately.

61
00:04:33,394 --> 00:04:34,001
Oh?

62
00:04:34,002 --> 00:04:36,097
Is that…

63
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:37,694
This thing?

64
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,993
I had the skilled father-daughter
blacksmith duo make a new sword for me.

65
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:43,408
Rud, your new sword is ready.

66
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,304
I polished your shield for you too.

67
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,996
As far as swords go,
it's an excellent weapon,

68
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,200
but this one even comes
with the "Enchant" skill.

69
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,597
Impressive.

70
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:54,390
What's "Enchant"?

71
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,202
It's a skill that lets you alter
the magical properties of a magic stone

72
00:04:57,202 --> 00:04:58,806
and infuse them into the weapon.

73
00:05:00,194 --> 00:05:01,596
It should be quicker to show you.

74
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,706
I can use magic of all attributes,

75
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:06,697
but none of them
are powerful enough as attacks.

76
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,896
However,

77
00:05:07,897 --> 00:05:09,900
by infusing magic into this magic stone…

78
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:15,304
I can turn the sword
into a fire-attribute weapon.

79
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:18,498
In other words,
I can alter the weapon's attributes

80
00:05:18,498 --> 00:05:20,704
depending on the monsters' weaknesses.

81
00:05:20,705 --> 00:05:22,101
I see.

82
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:26,196
You're an F-rank, aren't you?

83
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:28,103
Giving something like this to you
seems like a waste.

84
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:29,895
Hey, don't be like that.

85
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,501
You're a C-rank?

86
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:33,889
That's right.

87
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,895
Even if you wield such a nice sword,

88
00:05:34,895 --> 00:05:37,201
it's useless since you're just an F-rank.

89
00:05:37,202 --> 00:05:38,801
You might as well head back home now,

90
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,111
old man.

91
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:43,401
What… What's the deal
with that adventurer?

92
00:05:43,402 --> 00:05:45,699
Master, are you just going to take that?

93
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,097
Calm down, Luna.

94
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:50,006
It's better to be underestimated

95
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:51,794
than overestimated.

96
00:05:52,464 --> 00:05:54,293
That may be true,

97
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:57,993
but I don't like it
when they belittle you.

98
00:05:58,604 --> 00:05:59,500
See?

99
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,551
This is what happens
when you refuse to update your rank.

100
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:05,408
Even though you're strong enough
that even I, a saint,

101
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:07,501
would want to nominate you as a knight.

102
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,901
Saint Nin, is that true?

103
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:12,694
Yes, but he refused.

104
00:06:12,695 --> 00:06:13,695
Why?

105
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,103
Because once your rank goes up,

106
00:06:16,104 --> 00:06:18,402
sometimes the guild calls you in for help.

107
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,602
And besides, I only became an adventurer
in the first place

108
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:24,197
to cure Manicia.

109
00:06:30,897 --> 00:06:32,197
It's the Chameleon Kong!

110
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:32,998
It's coming from above!

111
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,896
That girl's got skills.

112
00:06:50,897 --> 00:06:51,609
Yes.

113
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:54,003
Fil is far better
than your ordinary adventurer.

114
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:56,706
"Taunt".

115
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:14,302
Every blow is heavy, but…

116
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,490
No one has been hit.

117
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:21,440
And we've been consistently attacking it.

118
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,610
Everyone, let's bring it down!

119
00:07:24,905 --> 00:07:26,389
But something doesn't feel right.

120
00:07:27,391 --> 00:07:28,595
Such a bold and blatant attack,

121
00:07:28,595 --> 00:07:30,589
roaring as if it's trying
to attract enemy attention,

122
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,407
in human society, we call this a tank.

123
00:07:40,805 --> 00:07:42,500
What? There were others?

124
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:43,501
I wasn't made aware of this!

125
00:07:44,306 --> 00:07:45,111
Everyone, dodge!

126
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:49,305
A monster capable

127
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,100
of using diversion.

128
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:54,833
We've been surrounded.

129
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,893
What do we do?

130
00:07:58,402 --> 00:08:00,303
This… This is beyond my capability.

131
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:01,304
Fil,

132
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:03,801
if the leader is scared,
everyone will be affected.

133
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:06,611
Leader?

134
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:09,597
Yes, aren't you our leader?

135
00:08:10,902 --> 00:08:11,614
That's right.

136
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,600
Surely you can break through this.

137
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:15,300
I can.

138
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:17,706
Let's do this again!

139
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:20,001
"Taunt"!

140
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:23,397
Get back in formation!

141
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,393
It's too dangerous
to fight three monsters all at once!

142
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:32,607
Don't think you can
take me down with this!

143
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:38,791
I'll make you regret

144
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,694
attacking Master!

145
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:41,695
"Wind Sword"!

146
00:08:44,385 --> 00:08:45,994
Finish it off!

147
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:47,703
Let's do this!

148
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:54,900
It should be fine to leave that to them.

149
00:08:54,904 --> 00:08:55,805
Next…

150
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,201
I remember
Chameleon Kongs are weak to fire.

151
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:04,193
"Enchant: Fire Attribute."

152
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:12,151
Not bad.

153
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:13,503
I'll leave the rest to you.

154
00:09:13,504 --> 00:09:14,303
Got it.

155
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:20,989
The vigilante corps will take care of it!

156
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:36,803
Luna!

157
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:37,598
Yes!

158
00:09:38,898 --> 00:09:39,996
"Wind Sword"!

159
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:46,434
I won't let you escape.

160
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:55,300
With this, it's over.

161
00:10:07,296 --> 00:10:07,999
Is everyone all right?

162
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,510
We defeated the Chameleon Kong!

163
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:12,700
What are you talking about?

164
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,503
If it weren't for Rud,
we wouldn't have been able to do anything.

165
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,700
That's true.

166
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,797
We finished up ours too.

167
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,405
Good.

168
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:26,751
To not be scared at all in that situation,

169
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,398
are you some kind of monster?

170
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,501
As a tank,

171
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:31,501
it's moments like those
that I can't back down.

172
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,196
I see…

173
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:35,292
Um,

174
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:37,011
I'm sorry I looked down on you.

175
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:39,707
It's no big deal.

176
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:42,705
After all, rank represents
an adventurer's strength.

177
00:10:43,298 --> 00:10:44,410
A low-ranking adventurer is bound

178
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,603
to draw second guesses.

179
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,789
The way it died is just like
the monsters in the labyrinth.

180
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,899
Rud, look over there.

181
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:13,201
Is that… the entrance to the labyrinth?

182
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:22,815
A… Avancier has a labyrinth now.

183
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,697
Tonight, we drink
to the future prosperity of the town.

184
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:27,608
Cheers!

185
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,897
Cheers!

186
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,092
Things are going to be busy around here.

187
00:11:31,092 --> 00:11:32,092
Bring them on.

188
00:11:32,093 --> 00:11:33,307
Thank you for your assistance.

189
00:11:36,694 --> 00:11:38,895
It's a big party tonight.

190
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:39,896
That's right.

191
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:41,795
After all,
with the appearance of the labyrinth,

192
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:44,102
we might solve the problem
of the town's declining population.

193
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,497
That would be wonderful, Master.

194
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,207
Indeed…

195
00:11:48,784 --> 00:11:50,395
Manicia.

196
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,815
Would you like to have a drink with me?

197
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:55,701
Do you have a death wish?

198
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:58,505
If you're lonely, I'll drink with you.

199
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,306
-My apologies.
-It sure is lively.

200
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:02,093
Miss Nin.

201
00:12:02,094 --> 00:12:03,197
Are you enjoying yourself?

202
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:04,897
Yes, very much.

203
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:09,394
But Master doesn't seem
all too happy about this.

204
00:12:09,402 --> 00:12:13,095
Understandable, there are pros and cons
to the appearance of a labyrinth.

205
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:14,804
He must be worried about that.

206
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:15,890
Is that so?

207
00:12:16,491 --> 00:12:17,287
Yes.

208
00:12:17,288 --> 00:12:18,807
A labyrinth can bring about
a great deal of problems.

209
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,695
If no one eliminates
the monsters in the labyrinth,

210
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:26,596
they will escape
like Chameleon Kongs did today.

211
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:28,793
Labyrinths that frequently experience
such incidents

212
00:12:28,794 --> 00:12:31,087
are considered a threat
to the nearby residents.

213
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:32,791
But when such incidents occur,

214
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:36,197
why not just go and defeat them,
like we did this morning?

215
00:12:36,804 --> 00:12:38,904
Doing that would create other problems.

216
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,403
Because anyone can become an adventurer.

217
00:12:43,404 --> 00:12:44,098
It means

218
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:46,800
even someone despicable and evil
can become one.

219
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:49,001
There are quite a few of those

220
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,204
that behave like stalkers,
going after cute girls.

221
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:53,999
And

222
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,202
you and Manicia
might become their targets.

223
00:12:57,304 --> 00:12:58,104
In that case,

224
00:12:58,105 --> 00:13:01,505
is there any way
to manage these adventurers?

225
00:13:01,506 --> 00:13:02,604
That's where the clans come in.

226
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:04,901
What's a "clan"?

227
00:13:04,902 --> 00:13:05,503
CLAN
PARTIES

228
00:13:05,504 --> 00:13:06,800
A clan, in essence,

229
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,992
is an organisation
that brings together multiple parties.

230
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,888
Adventurers affiliated with a clan

231
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,903
receive official recognition
from the country

232
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:15,899
and are obligated to protect
the towns, like knights.

233
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:17,801
After all,

234
00:13:17,802 --> 00:13:20,201
adventurers want security too.

235
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,050
Without a clan,

236
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,598
the entire town would descend into chaos,

237
00:13:25,508 --> 00:13:28,196
particularly in a small town like Avancier,
where combatants are limited.

238
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,600
Without a clan stationed,
adventurers attempting

239
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,194
to challenge the labyrinth
might cause trouble in the town.

240
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,498
If anything were to happen to Manicia…

241
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,196
Don't look so glum.

242
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:43,615
I'll help you guys as well.

243
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:45,903
Rud!

244
00:13:50,203 --> 00:13:52,011
So soothing…

245
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:54,805
-Stop, Fil! The shield force's going to…
-Good boy…

246
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:57,300
-It hurts…
-I just want to pet you…

247
00:13:57,301 --> 00:13:59,902
Fil, you're drunk!

248
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:02,703
You jerk!

249
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:04,301
Were you staring at me?

250
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,595
Are you asking for it?

251
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:07,705
Are you two

252
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,807
fighting again?

253
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,105
-I'm sorry!
-I'm sorry!

254
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,402
Good job on patrol.

255
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:21,689
Didn't expect so many adventurers
to show up

256
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:25,089
just a week after the labyrinth appeared.

257
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,073
Exactly.

258
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,594
Mister Rud,

259
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:30,070
thanks again for last time.

260
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:31,793
Rud,

261
00:14:31,801 --> 00:14:33,206
if anything happens again,
we'll be counting on you.

262
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,493
I heard you've been helping around town.

263
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:40,306
Well, one-sided restrictions won't work.

264
00:14:41,202 --> 00:14:42,902
I heard there's a fight
going on over there!

265
00:14:42,903 --> 00:14:44,006
This way!

266
00:14:49,801 --> 00:14:52,094
Black Dragon Fang's No.3, Bu,

267
00:14:53,197 --> 00:14:55,395
and White Tiger Claw's No.3, Gali.

268
00:14:56,404 --> 00:14:58,797
They're both A-rank adventurers.

269
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:00,499
If they start fighting,
it could be dangerous.

270
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,707
Hold it.

271
00:15:04,598 --> 00:15:06,110
You're scaring the townsfolk.

272
00:15:06,807 --> 00:15:08,192
Could you please stop?

273
00:15:08,904 --> 00:15:10,310
Who are you?

274
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,298
The pride of our clans
are on the line here.

275
00:15:13,298 --> 00:15:14,846
Why don't you stay out of this?

276
00:15:15,398 --> 00:15:16,790
Looks like you guys
aren't planning to back down, huh?

277
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:20,888
Why don't you decide, then?

278
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:23,281
Whether Black Dragon Fang
or White Tiger Claw

279
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:25,797
will establish themselves in this town.

280
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:28,601
We don't want either of you
if you're going to cause trouble.

281
00:15:28,602 --> 00:15:29,602
Why don't you go back?

282
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,493
You!

283
00:15:32,494 --> 00:15:34,989
Don't you dare treat Mister Bu
in such a rude manner!

284
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:40,697
And don't even think about trying.

285
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:44,217
Unlike Rud, I won't be showing any mercy.

286
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,210
This town has its own rules.

287
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:51,402
I'm willing to go all the way
if you try anything here.

288
00:15:53,895 --> 00:15:55,099
Sorry.

289
00:15:55,099 --> 00:15:56,312
We're sorry, too.

290
00:15:57,299 --> 00:15:58,192
By the way,

291
00:15:58,192 --> 00:15:59,805
do you belong to a clan?

292
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,501
-If not, won't you consider us?
-Beat it, Gali!

293
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,794
This guy belongs with us,
the Black Dragon Fang!

294
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:04,795
Black Dragon.

295
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:05,508
White Tiger.

296
00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:06,352
Black Dragon.

297
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:07,301
White Tiger.

298
00:16:08,495 --> 00:16:09,704
I'll be joining neither.

299
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,395
That's enough.

300
00:16:11,395 --> 00:16:12,792
Welcome to Avancier.

301
00:16:15,701 --> 00:16:17,893
Knowing when to call it quits,

302
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,705
adventurers affiliated with clans

303
00:16:20,706 --> 00:16:22,011
are different from non-affiliated ones.

304
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:24,009
But it looks like I won't be able

305
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,510
to leave town for a while.

306
00:16:27,204 --> 00:16:29,203
I can't believe they invited you
to join their clans.

307
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:30,403
Same.

308
00:16:31,298 --> 00:16:33,729
I used to aspire to join a clan too.

309
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:36,500
Dreamed of one day

310
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,895
living the adventurer life in a clan,
like a big family.

311
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:40,896
Rud!

312
00:16:41,207 --> 00:16:42,599
Has the conflict between the clans
been resolved?

313
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,689
It's all settled.

314
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,797
Well then,
you should head to the headquarters.

315
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,201
Mister Vild needs to see you.

316
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,900
Mister Vild?

317
00:16:51,699 --> 00:16:53,403
In light of the situation in Avancier,

318
00:16:53,404 --> 00:16:55,205
the lord has two proposals.

319
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,892
The lord, you say?

320
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,395
He asked me to choose
one of the two proposals.

321
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:03,606
The first proposal is...

322
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:05,598
Rud,

323
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,299
you must establish a clan
and become the clan leader.

324
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,196
Me?

325
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,490
Why, all of a sudden...

326
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,686
It's not sudden.

327
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:18,091
He has been mentioning you
quite frequently since some time ago,

328
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:20,997
talking about a young
and talented adventurer.

329
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,999
I appreciate the lord's recognition,

330
00:17:25,903 --> 00:17:27,903
but taking on such a role doesn't suit me

331
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:30,104
as I will be occupied
with finding a cure for Manicia.

332
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:32,009
I understand.

333
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,009
However…

334
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,907
that is the wish of the town.

335
00:17:35,908 --> 00:17:38,003
Even though you have no experience,

336
00:17:38,004 --> 00:17:40,504
the people would rather it be you
than some stranger.

337
00:17:42,406 --> 00:17:44,088
I'm truly grateful to have their trust.

338
00:17:44,917 --> 00:17:47,503
When Manicia is cured,

339
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:49,301
I'd like to be able to continue
to live in peace in this town too.

340
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:52,490
I'd like to do something
for the town, too, but...

341
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:55,593
The second proposal is...

342
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,728
to destroy the labyrinth in Avancier.

343
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,306
But then, the development of the town…

344
00:18:02,307 --> 00:18:05,996
There are so many labyrinths
appearing all across the country now

345
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:08,396
that they cannot manage all of them,

346
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,798
including Avancier's labyrinth.

347
00:18:11,637 --> 00:18:15,399
The higher-ups seem to be averse
to adding more unmanageable labyrinths.

348
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,893
So, if you can't establish a clan,

349
00:18:19,894 --> 00:18:22,697
they hope you can join a party
to investigate the labyrinth

350
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:25,491
and work together to destroy it.

351
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,608
I'm sorry for asking you to do this,
but could you make the choice?

352
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,794
To become a clan leader
and manage the town and labyrinth

353
00:18:33,497 --> 00:18:34,991
or to destroy the labyrinth,

354
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,301
please make the decision.

355
00:18:44,301 --> 00:18:46,194
I won't ask you
to make an immediate decision,

356
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:47,084
but if possible,

357
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:49,287
I hope you can let me know
your answer soon.

358
00:18:50,114 --> 00:18:51,607
Stinking thief!

359
00:18:51,608 --> 00:18:53,492
You were going to steal from me!

360
00:18:53,492 --> 00:18:55,008
I'm not a thief!

361
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,700
It was just a mistake!

362
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,192
Hey, stop it!

363
00:18:58,193 --> 00:18:58,804
Shut up!

364
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,749
You're just an adventurer.
Don't interfere!

365
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:04,700
The only way to resolve this situation

366
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:06,754
is to establish a clan, huh?

367
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,198
Found you!

368
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,190
Master!

369
00:19:10,499 --> 00:19:12,403
Master, you must hurry home!

370
00:19:13,807 --> 00:19:14,899
Lady Manicia…

371
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:21,401
Granny Gigi! How's Manicia?

372
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,093
Don't worry.

373
00:19:24,094 --> 00:19:28,101
She's just a little sick, as usual.

374
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:29,112
Oh...

375
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:33,198
You're too much of a worrywart.

376
00:19:34,094 --> 00:19:35,385
More importantly,

377
00:19:35,386 --> 00:19:37,197
is the town doing okay?

378
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:39,886
You don't have to worry about that.

379
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,705
Rest well.

380
00:19:41,412 --> 00:19:42,210
Okay.

381
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:48,896
If I become the leader of the clan,

382
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:52,108
I won't be able to leave Avancier
for extended periods

383
00:19:53,412 --> 00:19:56,502
and won't be able
to explore labyrinths like before.

384
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,603
I don't know if I can obtain a treasure
that can grant any wish for sure,

385
00:20:01,604 --> 00:20:02,604
but

386
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:04,406
staying here

387
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:05,621
won't save Manicia.

388
00:20:07,307 --> 00:20:08,499
Nin, Luna,

389
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,003
there's something
I'd like to ask for your help.

390
00:20:17,803 --> 00:20:18,997
I...

391
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:20,901
I want to destroy Avancier's labyrinth.

392
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:23,611
Please lend me your support.

393
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:25,918
Are you sure about this?

394
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,000
Your choice

395
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,597
could ruin the town's prospects.

396
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:34,706
If I have to choose
between Manicia and the town,

397
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:37,812
I will choose Manicia.

398
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,003
Um...

399
00:20:42,536 --> 00:20:44,201
Can I ask a question?

400
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:48,789
If Master becomes the clan leader,

401
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:53,097
do you have to stay in town?

402
00:20:54,898 --> 00:20:56,814
If I take on the role of clan leader,

403
00:20:56,815 --> 00:20:59,800
I'll likely have to stay until
the situation in Avancier stabilises.

404
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,010
Is that the only solution?

405
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,410
Can't you find someone

406
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:06,594
to take on your duties while you're away?

407
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,295
No, even if that were possible,

408
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:11,097
I wouldn't feel right passing
this responsibility to someone else.

409
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:11,963
I'll do it.

410
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:16,191
If I can stand in for Master
and protect this town,

411
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:17,402
I'll do it.

412
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,507
I love this town
that welcomed me and accepted me.

413
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,794
So, just like how Master helped me,

414
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:28,497
I want to do my best to help you too.

415
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:30,993
But...

416
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:33,511
Are you trying to hide
your true feelings again?

417
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:35,804
Nin...

418
00:21:35,805 --> 00:21:38,800
Don't worry,
I'll be right here supporting Luna.

419
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,091
I was planning
to quit my role as a saint anyway.

420
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:42,008
The church...

421
00:21:42,008 --> 00:21:45,178
might not be thrilled,
but they'll have to respect my decision.

422
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:46,700
So,

423
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,808
let me join your clan and lend you a hand.

424
00:21:49,397 --> 00:21:52,186
Why are you two doing this for me?

425
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:56,898
There are many people
who are grateful to you.

426
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,296
You've always protected them.

427
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:03,905
It makes sense
that they'd want to return the favour too.

428
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,395
It is as Miss Nin said.

429
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,643
Is this really okay?

430
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,681
Of course.

431
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:11,997
So, don't look so defeated.

432
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,199
Just do what you want.
You don't need to hold back.

433
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:20,005
Big Brother.

434
00:22:21,194 --> 00:22:22,007
Manicia!

435
00:22:23,699 --> 00:22:25,096
You should be resting...

436
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,810
I'm not the little girl

437
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:35,105
who needs to rely on you
for everything anymore.

438
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:38,197
Just like Miss Luna,

439
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:39,802
I love this town very much.

440
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:44,411
If you have the ability
to protect this town,

441
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,403
I want you to keep it safe.

442
00:22:52,293 --> 00:22:54,999
After all, I'm in the pink of health.

443
00:22:58,303 --> 00:22:59,807
No, you're not...

444
00:23:00,606 --> 00:23:02,495
Even you…

445
00:23:06,102 --> 00:23:07,297
I take back what I said.

446
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:12,600
I want to protect Manicia and this town.

447
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:15,394
So, please help me.

448
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:16,994
Of course.
