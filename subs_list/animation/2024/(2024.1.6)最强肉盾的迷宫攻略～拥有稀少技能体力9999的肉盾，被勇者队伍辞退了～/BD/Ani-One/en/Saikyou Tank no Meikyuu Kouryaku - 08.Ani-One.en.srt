1
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:05,104
Great work today, everyone.

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,506
Cheers!

3
00:00:10,602 --> 00:00:13,606
Alcohol tastes great
after a successful labyrinth raid.

4
00:00:13,607 --> 00:00:15,707
Glad you like it.

5
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:18,298
Is alcohol really that good?

6
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:19,811
If you're curious,

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,704
why not take a sip?

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,608
I've never heard that Homunculi can drink.

9
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:28,704
Is this okay?

10
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,004
I really want to try...

11
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:33,593
All right.

12
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:34,894
Just a little.

13
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:37,201
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:48,896
It takes a while to get used to the taste.

15
00:00:48,897 --> 00:00:51,199
Why did you make me try it then?

16
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:56,005
To see your reaction, of course.

17
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:58,598
It gets better after a few tries.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,598
Enough about that.

19
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:04,898
You seem to be getting quite close
to Lilia and Lily.

20
00:01:06,295 --> 00:01:08,395
I think we're about the same
as we were before.

21
00:01:08,396 --> 00:01:10,095
Really?

22
00:01:10,096 --> 00:01:11,493
What do you think, Luna?

23
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:13,906
Hey. Don't drag Luna into this.

24
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:17,798
I think you guys are close too.

25
00:01:17,798 --> 00:01:19,802
Did that one sip get her drunk?

26
00:01:20,606 --> 00:01:21,507
That's not it.

27
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:23,303
They're not our clan members,

28
00:01:23,304 --> 00:01:25,101
but they helped us a lot too.

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,507
So,

30
00:01:26,508 --> 00:01:27,697
I was just worried

31
00:01:27,697 --> 00:01:29,505
if we'd cause them any trouble.

32
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,697
So, it's not a relationship
beyond friendship?

33
00:01:32,697 --> 00:01:34,489
Not at all.

34
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,701
Then,

35
00:01:38,506 --> 00:01:41,507
would you consider
that kind of relationship with me?

36
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,010
Are you drunk?

37
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:48,097
Maybe.

38
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,297
I've told you this before.

39
00:01:52,297 --> 00:01:54,108
It's not something
I'd consider at the moment.

40
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:56,255
Raiding labyrinths is

41
00:01:56,256 --> 00:01:58,997
the most important thing
for me at this time.

42
00:01:58,998 --> 00:02:00,408
So, I'm not considering

43
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,097
that kind of relationship
with anyone right now.

44
00:02:03,097 --> 00:02:06,213
That means we have to hurry up
and settle all the matters.

45
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:08,087
Which means

46
00:02:08,088 --> 00:02:11,098
Master isn't seeing anyone right now?

47
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:13,198
Yes, that's right.

48
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:17,388
Is something the matter?

49
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:20,109
Being with Master

50
00:02:20,712 --> 00:02:22,991
always makes me very happy.

51
00:02:22,991 --> 00:02:25,303
My heart can't help but feel warm.

52
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:29,701
So, I want to be with Master forever.

53
00:02:30,505 --> 00:02:32,610
Is... Is that so?

54
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,887
Rud, you're rather popular.

55
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,098
Shut up.

56
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:39,704
Um,

57
00:02:39,705 --> 00:02:41,506
do you want some water?

58
00:02:43,105 --> 00:02:44,701
Luna! Are you okay?

59
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,596
-Looks like she's going to be a handful.
-She's completely drunk.

60
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,105
I feel drained...

61
00:02:57,403 --> 00:02:58,910
Huh? What?

62
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:01,102
Lilia?

63
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:17,517
THE STRONGEST TANK'S LABYRINTH RAIDS

64
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,823
A TANK WITH A RARE 9999 RESISTANCE SKILL
GOT KICKED FROM THE HERO'S PARTY

65
00:04:34,995 --> 00:04:36,109
Lilia?

66
00:04:38,598 --> 00:04:40,404
Rud. Welcome back.

67
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:43,207
Wait, why are you sleeping on my bed?

68
00:04:46,603 --> 00:04:49,195
I had something I wanted to check on,

69
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:52,223
so I asked Marius to let me come in
and wait for you.

70
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,919
I'll leave you to the guard the room.

71
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:57,508
I guess I'm more tired than I thought.

72
00:04:57,509 --> 00:04:58,906
I see.

73
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:00,896
So, what did you need to talk to me about?

74
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,099
It's about Lily.

75
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:08,005
She worked really hard today, didn't she?

76
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:09,894
Yes.

77
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:12,600
Lily performed better than I expected.

78
00:05:12,601 --> 00:05:14,012
To be honest, she surprised me too.

79
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:17,811
She's always been a kid
who can do anything if she keeps cool.

80
00:05:17,812 --> 00:05:19,090
This is nothing.

81
00:05:19,705 --> 00:05:21,102
You're twins, after all.

82
00:05:21,102 --> 00:05:23,198
It's not like
there's a huge gap in your abilities.

83
00:05:24,705 --> 00:05:26,909
Lily's working really hard.

84
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,501
She's trying to change, little by little.

85
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:32,206
Though maybe she overdid it today,
she came back and collapsed from exhaustion.

86
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:34,793
What's wrong with you?

87
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:38,712
What do you think about change?

88
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,215
Don't you find it scary?

89
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,384
Well,

90
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,303
I actually don't like change much either.

91
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,706
Especially recently,

92
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:49,891
when Avancier started to change,

93
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,588
I felt like keeping things the same
would be better.

94
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:57,115
I think many people in town
probably share the same thought as me.

95
00:05:58,304 --> 00:05:59,305
Even now,

96
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:01,503
I'm not sure if what I'm doing is right.

97
00:06:02,807 --> 00:06:03,703
But sometimes,

98
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:05,809
I'm glad I embraced change.

99
00:06:07,803 --> 00:06:09,903
If we had stayed the same,

100
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:11,810
we wouldn't see Avancier so lively
and bustling now.

101
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:14,815
That's why I think

102
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:17,399
it's important to enjoy the change.

103
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,808
I've always thought it's best
to keep things the way they are.

104
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,907
And I still do.

105
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:29,209
Honestly, I'm weaker than Lily.

106
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,598
Of course, I want to support her...

107
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:36,507
But watching Lily drift away from me
makes me feel a little lonely.

108
00:06:37,707 --> 00:06:39,899
Compared to Lily
who wants to be independent,

109
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,969
Lilia, who can't be apart
from her sister, might find it harder

110
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,695
to adapt to the change.

111
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,790
Even though some things might change,

112
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,198
I think

113
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,114
you and Lily will always be the same.

114
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:55,009
You two will always be close
and love each other.

115
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,210
Even if some things change,

116
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,906
the important things won't.

117
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:02,090
So, even if other things change,

118
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:04,407
you can still get along like you do now.

119
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,310
You're unexpectedly thoughtful.

120
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,000
Well, sorry. I was only saying
what came to mind.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,392
No, that'll do.

122
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,707
That's what I needed to hear.

123
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,006
Lily was shining so brightly today.

124
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:20,491
I couldn't look at her at all.

125
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,095
But

126
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:25,100
starting tomorrow, I will be watching her

127
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:26,590
do her best.

128
00:07:28,501 --> 00:07:29,599
Go for it.

129
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,598
I will.

130
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:42,310
"CAIRD LABYRINTH: FIRST FLOOR"
Let's start from the 51st floor today.

131
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:43,588
Lily, do the honours.

132
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,512
Got it.

133
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:47,600
The two major clans
only made it to the 51st floor as well.

134
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,104
So we currently have no intel
on this level.

135
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:52,316
However, the mist
inside the labyrinth is thick.

136
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:53,722
We should have other means
to locate the monsters

137
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,615
besides detection magic.

138
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:59,695
In that case,
Lily will continue to use detection magic.

139
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,792
Marius and I will search for monsters
within visible range.

140
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,108
Luna, stay on high alert at all times.

141
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,312
Okay.

142
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:07,297
A… About yesterday,

143
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:09,103
I didn't mean anything.

144
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,597
Oh, okay.

145
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:14,002
Seems like Luna's the type
that won't black out even after drinking.

146
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:17,497
Ready, everyone?

147
00:08:18,295 --> 00:08:19,499
"Dungeon Walk".

148
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:24,807
CAIRD LABYRINTH, 51ST FLOOR

149
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,507
The fog is really thick here.

150
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,406
I don't think we can use
detection magic in this area.

151
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:32,904
Luna,

152
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:35,510
can you try clearing the fog
with wind magic?

153
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:36,599
Certainly.

154
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:43,901
It didn't work.

155
00:08:43,901 --> 00:08:44,899
This fog

156
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,994
was created by magic.

157
00:08:46,995 --> 00:08:47,702
What?

158
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:50,298
That's why it won't disperse
even if you use wind.

159
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,008
However,

160
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,896
all monsters have some magic on them.

161
00:08:53,897 --> 00:08:55,494
Just focus on detecting that energy.

162
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:57,798
I'll try.

163
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:04,002
It's not exact,
but I can vaguely sense it.

164
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:07,890
It's coming.

165
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:09,590
Everyone, get back.

166
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,509
Something's coming!

167
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,510
"Taunt"!

168
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,799
Water magic?

169
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:22,609
This looks like...

170
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,190
The enemy is likely a Sahuagin!

171
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:25,593
I'll dispel them.

172
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:33,805
It's too foggy. Our vision is obstructed.

173
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,804
Everyone,

174
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:42,590
move to the ten o'clock direction.

175
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,098
That area isn't surrounded by the fog yet.

176
00:09:45,404 --> 00:09:46,507
Leave it to me.

177
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,313
"Taunt"!

178
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,200
Finally coming out of the fog.

179
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,098
Just like Lily said.

180
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:57,311
It's a Sahuagin.

181
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:09,103
Even if I can't see with my eyes,
I can find you guys

182
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,610
by detecting your energy.

183
00:10:11,102 --> 00:10:12,311
Nice job, Marius.

184
00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:15,490
After that,

185
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:16,616
we mastered the detection technique

186
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,909
Marius taught us

187
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,012
and successfully defeated
all the Sahuagin.

188
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,103
Let's take a break
before heading to the next floor.

189
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:29,406
I'll cook us something.

190
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:30,602
We'll help.

191
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:36,208
You guys are going to eat the Sahuagin?

192
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:37,178
Yes.

193
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,607
We have to use this chance
to replenish our energy.

194
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:41,910
Speaking of which,

195
00:10:41,911 --> 00:10:44,609
the items we got from this drop
are quite something.

196
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:46,415
Right.

197
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:48,106
This is high-quality stuff.

198
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:52,985
I can finally look Lily in the eye
like I usually do.

199
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,508
Thanks to our talk last night.

200
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,240
Thank you.

201
00:10:59,595 --> 00:11:02,205
You two, food is ready.

202
00:11:02,206 --> 00:11:03,699
Sahuagin tastes great!

203
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,403
No fog here, but this place is spacious.

204
00:11:12,404 --> 00:11:14,103
Looks like a place
where a boss would appear.

205
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:15,597
Enemy approaching.

206
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,137
A magic circle?

207
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,613
It's a Dark Skeleton.

208
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:27,604
There's something else too.

209
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:33,206
Something we haven't seen before.

210
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:35,277
Blue, red, yellow.

211
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,988
They look like crystals.

212
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:39,398
"Sacrificial Shield".

213
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:43,814
Such a powerful aura.

214
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:45,904
It's unlike any opponent

215
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:47,207
we've faced so far.

216
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,750
Lily, please give instructions.

217
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,613
I'll start with physical attacks.

218
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,506
Understood.

219
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:55,312
"Taunt"!

220
00:11:59,011 --> 00:11:59,815
What?

221
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,501
It's the crystal.

222
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:04,199
When Rud attacked,
the yellow crystal unleashed

223
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,309
a protective shield.

224
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,105
This is a tricky foe.

225
00:12:08,106 --> 00:12:09,508
Should I put some distance
between us for now?

226
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,804
So the red one is offensive.

227
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:20,803
Then, the blue one is…

228
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,892
Its movements became faster.

229
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,810
I see.

230
00:12:27,504 --> 00:12:29,300
The yellow one acts as a tank for defence,

231
00:12:29,301 --> 00:12:30,499
the blue one enhances abilities,

232
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,399
and the red one is for magical attacks.

233
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,517
This is a tricky monster we're up against.

234
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,600
Among them, the yellow defence crystal
is the biggest problem.

235
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,592
How should we attack?

236
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,494
For now,

237
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,411
I'll attract its attention

238
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:48,400
and then attack from behind.

239
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,314
Our attacks were blocked.

240
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:57,394
But it seems it can only deploy
the shield around the crystals.

241
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:02,090
Great, that'll work.

242
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:03,405
Continue attacking it like this.

243
00:13:06,998 --> 00:13:08,092
A distraction?

244
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:09,811
Is everyone all right?

245
00:13:11,106 --> 00:13:12,288
Marius, what's wrong?

246
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,090
I'm fine. It's Lilia…

247
00:13:19,111 --> 00:13:20,867
Something's not right with her.

248
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,895
Lilia, what's wrong?

249
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,985
Don't…

250
00:13:29,986 --> 00:13:32,909
Don't bully Lily!

251
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:35,804
I must protect her.

252
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:37,615
Lily!

253
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,819
You've got me into trouble again.

254
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,487
Lilia!

255
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,394
I have to protect her.

256
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,807
Don't bully Lily!

257
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,809
I will

258
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,193
protect her…

259
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,907
I'm your father.

260
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:54,305
What's with that look?

261
00:13:54,996 --> 00:13:55,914
Someone...

262
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:58,504
-help us...
-You guys are such an eyesore.

263
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:06,810
I won't let you bully Lily anymore!

264
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:09,903
Nin, heal her.

265
00:14:09,903 --> 00:14:11,295
Hold on.

266
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:14,006
Lily and Luna were afflicted too.

267
00:14:14,007 --> 00:14:16,397
I have to heal them first.

268
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,586
Got it.

269
00:14:17,587 --> 00:14:18,691
I see.

270
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,697
Only Marius, Nin, and I

271
00:14:20,698 --> 00:14:22,306
are immune to abnormal status ailments.

272
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:24,604
If the entire party
falls into abnormal status,

273
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:26,309
we'll be wiped out.

274
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:31,093
"Life Conversion"!

275
00:14:33,515 --> 00:14:35,909
You sent it flying with the crystals.
Impressive.

276
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:37,513
Marius,

277
00:14:37,514 --> 00:14:39,296
can you hold the Dark Skeleton back?

278
00:14:40,302 --> 00:14:41,213
Leave it to me.

279
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,507
That thing's a lot easier to deal with.

280
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:43,993
Lilia!

281
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:52,091
I'm sorry, Lilia.

282
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,005
-Lilia, you need to calm down.
-Let go of me!

283
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:00,201
I won't let you bully Lily anymore!

284
00:15:00,202 --> 00:15:02,206
Don't bully Lily!

285
00:15:03,701 --> 00:15:05,297
You said you were abandoned
by your parents

286
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:07,012
and have been travelling
with only each other since.

287
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:09,401
Well,

288
00:15:09,402 --> 00:15:11,290
rather than say we were abandoned,

289
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,079
it would be more accurate to say
we ran away

290
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,211
because we were being abused.

291
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:17,412
Did the abnormal status

292
00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:19,604
trigger her past trauma?

293
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,505
If I remember correctly,
it's possible to calm down

294
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,216
someone that's panicking
by reassuring them with words

295
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,300
that can dispel the cause.

296
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:27,986
Lilia,

297
00:15:27,987 --> 00:15:30,106
no one is going to hurt you here.

298
00:15:35,405 --> 00:15:36,594
Don't worry.

299
00:15:36,594 --> 00:15:38,694
You two are strong now.

300
00:15:45,202 --> 00:15:46,801
Ru…Rud?

301
00:15:47,403 --> 00:15:48,699
That's right. It's me, Rud.

302
00:15:49,306 --> 00:15:50,505
Everyone is here.

303
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,396
So calm down.

304
00:15:56,995 --> 00:15:58,289
No matter what happens,

305
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,091
I'll do my best to protect you both.

306
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,092
I…

307
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:08,008
The Dark Skeleton's magic
must have thrown you

308
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,302
into a state of confusion.

309
00:16:11,688 --> 00:16:12,680
Don't worry.

310
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,500
There's plenty of people

311
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,608
that will help you now.

312
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,406
You're right.

313
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,906
I have Rud and everyone else.

314
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:27,486
Marius, thanks for holding it off.

315
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,502
Take a break and get yourself healed.

316
00:16:29,503 --> 00:16:31,198
This is nothing.

317
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,096
But roger that.

318
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:35,105
We won't be able to seriously damage it

319
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:36,912
unless we destroy the yellow crystal.

320
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,206
But if we can break it,

321
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,125
we can finish this.

322
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,420
It's trying to trap me.

323
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,796
In that case...

324
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,601
Nin,

325
00:16:46,602 --> 00:16:47,393
I need your support.

326
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:54,104
This will give me some protection
from the fire magic.

327
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,298
The crystals switch too quickly!

328
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:02,008
Is there really no other way?

329
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:07,192
Lilia, Marius,

330
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,007
I think I found an opening.

331
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:12,095
The water droplets on my body

332
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:13,202
went through its protective shield

333
00:17:13,203 --> 00:17:14,816
and landed on the Dark Skeleton.

334
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:16,497
I'm guessing this thing

335
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:19,310
can't resist both physical
and magical attacks at once.

336
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,208
It's worth a shot.

337
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,911
The fire magic penetrated
through the shield!

338
00:17:32,807 --> 00:17:35,210
This is payback for earlier.

339
00:17:41,611 --> 00:17:42,986
It blocked our attacks,

340
00:17:42,987 --> 00:17:44,911
but we managed to damage it.

341
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:45,912
Let's keep this up!

342
00:17:57,789 --> 00:17:58,607
It's no use.

343
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:01,442
You won't get us with that trick again.

344
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,399
Because I've used my magic

345
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,300
to nullify the effects
of all abnormal statuses.

346
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,400
Luna's wind magic.

347
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:12,716
Nin's water magic.

348
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,010
Lily's fire magic.

349
00:18:14,623 --> 00:18:15,703
It's incredible.

350
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:19,402
The yellow crystal is glowing!

351
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,308
It's trying to activate
the shield and escape!

352
00:18:22,896 --> 00:18:24,103
Rud?

353
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,506
You'll be damaged by our magic attacks.

354
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,107
I'll convert the damage

355
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,693
into power using "Life Conversion".

356
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:37,311
"Life Conversion"!

357
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,201
It's been weakened.

358
00:18:50,013 --> 00:18:51,212
It split into two!

359
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,010
Even the crystals duplicated.

360
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:57,500
Lilia, Marius,

361
00:18:57,501 --> 00:18:58,598
take one.

362
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,409
But we don't know which is the real one.

363
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,701
Any one will do.

364
00:19:02,702 --> 00:19:04,513
Rud won't be able to hold out much longer.

365
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,314
That's the real one!

366
00:19:27,293 --> 00:19:29,412
Its reaction is completely
different from earlier.

367
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,862
In that case…

368
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,889
This is the final blow.

369
00:19:39,301 --> 00:19:40,610
Marius, Lilia,

370
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:41,406
take it down!

371
00:19:58,993 --> 00:20:00,991
I thought it was over for us

372
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,320
when the boss suddenly spawned.

373
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,413
I need a break.

374
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:06,806
Yeah.

375
00:20:06,807 --> 00:20:08,582
Let's hurry up and find the magic circle

376
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,298
and get to the next floor so we can rest.

377
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,609
I'll use my detection magic to find it.

378
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:16,392
The fog isn't too thick here,
so it should work.

379
00:20:18,506 --> 00:20:19,301
That's strange.

380
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,211
What's wrong?

381
00:20:20,212 --> 00:20:21,803
I can't locate the magic circle.

382
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,607
I can't sense it at all.

383
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:26,304
Is this

384
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:27,894
the final floor?

385
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,905
Marius, what do you think?

386
00:20:32,396 --> 00:20:33,690
Honestly,

387
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,798
I haven't the faintest clue
what the guardian here is trying to do.

388
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:42,198
Maybe that Dark Skeleton
was their masterpiece

389
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:46,286
and seeing us defeat it scared them off.

390
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,391
So they sealed off the way
to stop us from advancing?

391
00:20:49,012 --> 00:20:49,816
Yes.

392
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:51,040
I don't think

393
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,793
this is an ordinary guardian
we're dealing with.

394
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,713
So this is as far as we can go?

395
00:20:56,574 --> 00:20:58,691
Still, we've made it far enough.

396
00:20:58,692 --> 00:20:59,894
Let's head back for now.

397
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:04,691
Aw.

398
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,308
Are you already turning back?

399
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:12,201
Who's there?

400
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:19,006
She's emitting such an intense aura...
Who is this girl?

401
00:21:19,704 --> 00:21:21,001
Rud, this is bad!

402
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,102
Oh, dear.

403
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:30,408
Did I set it so that
Dark Skeletons would continue to spawn?

404
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:32,709
Set?

405
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,586
If we get attacked
by four of them at once...

406
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,005
I thought I'd already disabled that.

407
00:21:41,805 --> 00:21:42,895
She took all of them down in one hit.

408
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:45,095
I didn't expect

409
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,389
a demon lord-class guardian would appear.
