1
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,639
My name is Greed.

2
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:38,349
But…

3
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,435
it seems you already know who I am.

4
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:44,855
Greed,

5
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:47,608
shut down the labyrinth immediately
and surrender.

6
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,944
If you do, I'll spare you.

7
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:53,906
Oh, my… And why should I?

8
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,908
We've wiped out all the monsters

9
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,034
you sent to the town.

10
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,620
You should be aware of our strengths.

11
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,247
Is that so?

12
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,626
He sent out that many monsters again!

13
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:09,964
Rud, calm down!

14
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,676
<i>That's right. I can't let him get to me.</i>

15
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,927
It's regrettable.

16
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,512
Merely relying on those monsters

17
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,264
won't be enough to defeat Avancia.

18
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,266
Is that really the case?

19
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:26,272
I can continuously summon monsters
with nearly unlimited points, you know?

20
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,399
It's only a matter of time…

21
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:32,862
Before that, we'll defeat you
and destroy this labyrinth.

22
00:02:35,156 --> 00:02:36,365
On another note,

23
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,576
there's something I've been curious about.

24
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,454
Those two over there

25
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,748
are Homunculi, right?

26
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:52,673
Miss Luna is also a Homunculus?

27
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,258
What are you talking about…?

28
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,301
Yes.

29
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,555
And?

30
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:02,892
Nothing.

31
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,060
I'm just a little moved, that's all.

32
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,897
After all, in my past research,

33
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,692
I've never seen Homunculi
grow as remarkably as you!

34
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,779
I never expected that living outside
could have such an impact on Homunculi!

35
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,573
How about it?

36
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,910
Won't you come back to me?

37
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:26,832
Sir Rud is my one and only master!

38
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:31,962
Luna. Rud.

39
00:03:32,755 --> 00:03:34,089
Why didn't you tell us?

40
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,717
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:42,181
I'm sorry that I kept it from you--

42
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,182
Good grief.

43
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,060
You better explain yourself
when we get back.

44
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:49,897
Luna!

45
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,108
Yes!

46
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,402
My, my…

47
00:03:57,655 --> 00:03:58,697
In that case…

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,791
I might as well take everything by force.

49
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,545
Although I'm not quite fond
of this form of mine very much.

50
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,177
<i>Such a heavy attack!</i>

51
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:23,264
<i>But as long as I reinforce
my whole body with mana…</i>

52
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:34,358
Samimina, dodge!

53
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,739
Are you all right?

54
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,158
I'm fine.

55
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,369
More importantly,

56
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,414
did you block that damage
with your shield force?

57
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,291
-Yes.
-You don't have to do that.

58
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,793
My life is meant

59
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,962
to save all Homunculi.

60
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,507
You can use me as a disposable weapon!

61
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:02,553
So whether you live or die doesn't matter
as long as we defeat Greed?

62
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,470
Yes.

63
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,473
Then…

64
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,268
do not participate in this battle.

65
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:12,479
Because I don't want to lose anyone.

66
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:16,191
I am a Homunculus.
I don't have a life to begin with.

67
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,570
Greed only sees you as a tool to use.

68
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,865
Are you trying to make me treat you

69
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,867
like the humans you despise?

70
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:29,538
If not, then don't
sacrifice yourself in battle,

71
00:05:30,164 --> 00:05:30,998
do you understand?

72
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,044
Oh my.

73
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,255
I'm surprised you guys
still have the leisure to chat.

74
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,340
-Magic Shield!
-Magic Shield!

75
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,678
So you've got tricks up your sleeves.

76
00:05:45,304 --> 00:05:46,180
Taunt!

77
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,475
Is that a skill?

78
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,185
How annoying.

79
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,318
What?

80
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,070
I nullified your magic.

81
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:02,696
How dare you!

82
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,164
You rascals! How dare you do this to me!

83
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,250
L-Let go of me! Let go of me!

84
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,544
My power is being…

85
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,172
Could it be that these cuffs are…

86
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,673
Curses!

87
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,175
Curses!

88
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,552
Take this!

89
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,480
Life Burst!

90
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:39,525
Sir Hero…

91
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,901
Don't let your guard down!

92
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:41,902
Y-Yes!

93
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:46,073
You guys did well.

94
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,867
So have some confidence in yourselves!

95
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,870
-Yes.
-Yes.

96
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,253
Amazing!

97
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,047
Miss Amon, please join the battle as well.

98
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,675
But I'm tired.

99
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,261
I do not fancy a man that is annoying.

100
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:10,806
Lady Manicia

101
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,560
prepared these super sweet doughnuts
for the hardworking Miss Amon.

102
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,563
Shall I tell her not to bother with them

103
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,064
since your heart's not in it?

104
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,399
W-What?

105
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,067
Why didn't you say so earlier?

106
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,070
I never said I wasn't going to fight!

107
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,283
My woeful kin,

108
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,952
return to the darkness!

109
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,330
Chat Magic Balnoir!

110
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,380
Run!

111
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,103
Please don't destroy the town.

112
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,565
Well then, let's take Greed back
to the town with us.

113
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:04,943
What's this?

114
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,946
Do Demon Lords have
such magic stones in their chests?

115
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,782
No, could it be…

116
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,709
<i>What's going on?</i>

117
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:28,759
<i>This magic…</i>

118
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,428
<i>It's nothing like
we've ever been up against.</i>

119
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,774
Are you the real one?

120
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:50,072
I created him
based on my memories and abilities,

121
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,867
so I'd say that Homunculus
is as good as the real one.

122
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,247
Though its combat abilities
leave much to be desired.

123
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,084
My name is Greed.

124
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:03,877
A pleasure to make…

125
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,297
I believe we can skip the formalities.

126
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,843
We'll soon bid each other farewell anyway.

127
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:14,972
<i>If it's this attack speed…</i>

128
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:16,765
Rud!

129
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,392
I'm fine!

130
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,938
<i>With a lift of his finger,
he can conjure up such a powerful attack!</i>

131
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,608
<i>I must use my mana
to make myself stronger or else…</i>

132
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:35,951
Rud!

133
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,543
No point in using the move
we used for Amon…

134
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,211
-Skill: Fusion!
-Skill: Fusion!

135
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,845
Don't worry. Keep attacking like this.

136
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,647
Prepare yourself!

137
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,609
Miss Samimina!

138
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,653
Thank you!

139
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,620
Everyone, regroup.

140
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,332
What's going on?

141
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,174
Master!

142
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:37,179
That took a great deal
off my shield force.

143
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:39,431
I'll distract him.

144
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,183
Please restore Rud's shield force.

145
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,100
Got it.

146
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,689
<i>Even as Lilialy,</i>

147
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,067
<i>they can only defend against Greed.</i>

148
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,486
<i>We'll have to seize the opportunity</i>

149
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,113
<i>and take him down
with one powerful strike.</i>

150
00:10:55,197 --> 00:10:56,865
<i>Otherwise, we won't stand a chance.</i>

151
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,701
Taunt!

152
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,211
It's futile.

153
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,058
<i>I've accumulated 20,000 damage so far.</i>

154
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,268
<i>Let's settle this with this move!</i>

155
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,563
Life Conversion!

156
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:33,860
Luna! Samimina!

157
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,196
-Get them to Nin!
-Got it.

158
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,743
No way!

159
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,580
<i>Lilia and Lily are incapacitated.</i>

160
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:47,165
<i>What should we do?</i>

161
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,173
<i>Even with my current mana enhancement,</i>

162
00:11:55,257 --> 00:11:57,300
<i>I'm still lacking in speed and strength.</i>

163
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,261
<i>More…</i>

164
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,596
<i>I need to channel more mana into my body!</i>

165
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:12,774
<i>Dang it!</i>

166
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,360
<i>That one hit
depleted all of my shield force!</i>

167
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,364
<i>But this means
I can use Life Conversion one more time.</i>

168
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,451
<i>Let the mana flow throughout my body.</i>

169
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,537
<i>This time, I have to finish him
with everything I've got!</i>

170
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,581
Life Conversion!

171
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:34,463
Rud!

172
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,759
<i>Did my shield shatter?</i>

173
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,679
<i>Even with the mana enhancement,</i>

174
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,765
<i>it hurts so much I can't move.</i>

175
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,978
Everyone, run!

176
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:54,774
<i>What happened?</i>

177
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:55,901
Miss Luna! Miss Nin!

178
00:12:55,984 --> 00:13:00,864
-<i>Was I knocked away by Greed's attack?</i>
-Luna, get over here!

179
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:03,366
Samimina!

180
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,701
-<i>I have to hurry…</i>
-Dang it!

181
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,787
<i>I have to save everyone!</i>

182
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:09,956
<i>Dang… Dang it!</i>

183
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,375
<i>I can't muster up my mana…</i>

184
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,878
<i>Come on!</i>

185
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,882
<i>Everyone's shield force…</i>

186
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,177
<i>is depleted!</i>

187
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:34,689
Luna!

188
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,567
<i>At this rate,</i>

189
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,653
<i>Luna and everyone will…</i>

190
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,863
<i>Get up!</i>

191
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,366
<i>Please!</i>

192
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,826
<i>Curses!</i>

193
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,662
<i>Let all my mana</i>

194
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,455
<i>flow through my body.</i>

195
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,458
<i>Ignore the pain.</i>

196
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,669
<i>Break the limits!</i>

197
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:57,254
<i>I am…</i>

198
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,757
<i>the tank of this party!</i>

199
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:17,732
Rud?

200
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,243
R-Rud?

201
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,960
Destroy!

202
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,921
-<i>There's a voice echoing in my head.</i>
-Destroy!

203
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,631
Destroy!

204
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:47,095
-<i>It wants me to destroy everything.</i>
-Destroy…

205
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:04,404
<i>Channel more mana into my body.</i>

206
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,656
<i>Keep hitting until this guy breaks!</i>

207
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,658
<i>Over and over!</i>

208
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,327
<i>Over and over!</i>

209
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,329
<i>Over and over!</i>

210
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:19,002
<i>This is… so satisfying!</i>

211
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:19,961
Rud!

212
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,424
Who is it?

213
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,844
<i>I can't see them.</i>

214
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,680
<i>Is there someone else here?</i>

215
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,475
<i>Then,</i>

216
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,894
<i>I must destroy them too.</i>

217
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,568
Come to your senses!

218
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,196
Nin?

219
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,156
I put some magic in that slap.

220
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,200
Well? Are you back to normal?

221
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,868
Uh… yeah.

222
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,164
<i>I was consumed by my mana.</i>

223
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,751
<i>Is that why I lost control?</i>

224
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,048
Rud!

225
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:07,717
My mana is acting up again…

226
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,180
Destroy…

227
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:13,807
You should learn to control it.

228
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,059
Those who cannot control mana

229
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,061
will become monsters.

230
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,562
<i>That voice…</i>

231
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,482
<i>I've heard that voice somewhere before.</i>

232
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,776
<i>That's…</i>

233
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,280
<i>my voice.</i>

234
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,076
<i>If this continues,</i>

235
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,537
<i>I might turn into a monster
and go berserk.</i>

236
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,789
Rud!

237
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,957
<i>Deep breaths.</i>

238
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,209
<i>I need to control my mana.</i>

239
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:44,963
Rud!

240
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,509
Rud!

241
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,636
Thank you, Nin.

242
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:53,680
Thanks to you,

243
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:55,682
I was able to keep my mana under control.

244
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,561
Thank goodness.

245
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,567
<i>Now's not the time
to let myself be overwhelmed by my mana.</i>

246
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,696
<i>I have to protect everyone.</i>

247
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,243
Greed!

248
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,166
The town you wish to protect is no more!

249
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,545
I'll make sure they,
along with your party,

250
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,506
are completely eradicated

251
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:31,968
from this world!

252
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,638
Nin, I need your help.

253
00:17:36,848 --> 00:17:39,726
Keep casting healing magic on me.

254
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:42,854
Don't stop for even a second.

255
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,733
I want to bet everything on this strike.

256
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:50,320
I know this request is reckless…

257
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,322
What are you saying at a time like this?

258
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:57,452
I'm the healer of this party.
Go ahead and do what you need to do!

259
00:17:58,119 --> 00:17:58,953
Will do.

260
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,998
<i>Just hold on a little longer, everyone!
Don't give up!</i>

261
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,459
<i>Life Burst!</i>

262
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,171
<i>You're a hundred years too early
to lay a hand on me!</i>

263
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,298
<i>Here's a newly made sword.</i>

264
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,966
<i>Take it!</i>

265
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,302
<i>Please heal the ones over there first</i>

266
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,470
<i>and get more bandages.</i>

267
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,600
Greed,

268
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:22,268
we owe all of this to you.

269
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,772
Adventurers, Vigilante Corps,

270
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:29,234
Homunculi, Marius, Amon,

271
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:33,029
as long as I'm in the same space
with everyone, my skills can link them.

272
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,284
Sacrificial Shield!

273
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,080
My body suddenly became lighter.

274
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,498
What's going on?

275
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,959
The shield force isn't decreasing anymore.

276
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,961
Is this…

277
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,963
Rud's skill?

278
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:51,798
Greed.

279
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:55,677
Thanks to you showing me
the vision of Avancia,

280
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,180
{\an8}I was able to transfer
all the shield force damage from everyone

281
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,474
{\an8}in this space onto myself.

282
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,397
As the strongest tank,

283
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:13,945
I will protect…

284
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,906
everyone!

285
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,163
Life Conversion!

286
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,351
Big Brother?

287
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,562
Is that Rud?

288
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,897
Have they returned?

289
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:50,648
It's Rud!

290
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:52,483
Rud!

291
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:53,818
Big Brother!

292
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,196
Manicia!

293
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,780
Everyone!

294
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,699
Big Brother!

295
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,039
I always believed

296
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,374
you would come back!

297
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,670
I've always come back, haven't I?

298
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,007
That's true.

299
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,010
Welcome back, Big Brother!

300
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,471
I'm back, Manicia.

301
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,556
Rud!

302
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,600
Marius. Amon.

303
00:20:26,184 --> 00:20:27,185
Is everyone all right?

304
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,646
There were just too many of them.

305
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,523
I couldn't hold all of them back
like you did.

306
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,068
But we managed to hold the fort.

307
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,861
Thank you.

308
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,280
-Rud!
-Rud!

309
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,077
You actually conquered the labyrinth
in such a short time!

310
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,703
Incredible!

311
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:46,746
Everyone…

312
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:50,291
It's thanks to all of you
for helping protect Avancia,

313
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,294
that we were able
to successfully destroy the labyrinth.

314
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,546
Thank you, everyone.

315
00:20:58,841 --> 00:20:59,717
Mister Rud?

316
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,808
Rud really is

317
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,853
-the strongest tank!
-the strongest tank!

318
00:23:05,593 --> 00:23:08,054
<i>I am Rud. I am a tank.</i>

319
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,599
<i>This is the story of how I, a tank,</i>

320
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,894
<i>became a hero.</i>

321
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,730
<i>I will continue to work hard</i>

322
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,233
<i>and protect everyone.</i>
