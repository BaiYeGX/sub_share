1
00:00:00,876 --> 00:00:03,879
"There are too many adventurers."
"I don't like the smell on them."

2
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,382
{\an8}"The tourists litter."

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,968
{\an8}"Please build a theatre."

4
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:10,594
{\an8}"Please build more roads."

5
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,347
{\an8}"Please station knights in Avancia."

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,476
These are the requests
of the town residents.

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,396
There are more besides those.

8
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:23,274
Please go through them, Big Brother.

9
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,568
I'll go clean up.

10
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:28,154
Lime, let's race to the second floor!

11
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,537
The sound of Manicia
running energetically up the stairs is

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,330
truly wonderful.

13
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,791
<i>Still,</i>

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,668
<i>I didn't expect to receive so many.</i>

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,671
<i>I'm glad we formed an alliance
with the two major clans,</i>

16
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,257
{\an8}<i>but even problems can arise
from such rapid development.</i>

17
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,761
Rud, come with me!

18
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,640
Nin? What's wrong?

19
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,641
This way!

20
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:00,561
{\an8}This girl collapsed on the road.

21
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,193
She's a Homunculus.

22
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,948
Please… Please help us!

23
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,367
I have friends!

24
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,244
We were attacked in the forest nearby!

25
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:18,704
Let's go.

26
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:19,622
Yes.

27
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:21,874
Master, I'll go too.

28
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,460
No, you need to stay here, Luna.

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,172
You treated her injuries.

30
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,799
She'll feel safer with you here.

31
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:33,552
I understand.

32
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,354
<i>Around the labyrinth?</i>

33
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,108
<i>But I'm the one managing
the labyrinth right now.</i>

34
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,611
<i>There shouldn't be monsters
spawning outside.</i>

35
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:15,696
Found them.

36
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,451
The Homunculi are fighting each other!

37
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,997
One side's clearly at a disadvantage.

38
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,874
{\an8}And the side that's under attack

39
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,627
{\an8}clearly has emotions
like the girl we found.

40
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:40,471
{\an8}I am an adventurer
from a nearby town called Avancia.

41
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,182
Please listen to what I have to say.

42
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,141
Please.

43
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,395
It's not working.

44
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,776
Your friend came to our town
and asked me to help you.

45
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,779
Hey!

46
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,325
<i>That girl's abilities are on par
with the pursuers.</i>

47
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,958
You must be the Homunculi she meant.

48
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,091
{\an8}Yes, it's us.

49
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,760
So, who are these?

50
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,473
They are combat-type Homunculi
from Brunn Quelez.

51
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,226
<i>Brunn Quelez?</i>

52
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,437
<i>Luna escaped from that country.</i>

53
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:33,649
<i>In other words,
these are illegally created Homunculi.</i>

54
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,986
Nin, heal them.

55
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:37,945
On it.

56
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,490
Area High Heal!

57
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,617
I was wondering
what all the ruckus was about.

58
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,578
It appears things
have gotten a bit tricky.

59
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,583
<i>It's only natural that she is uneasy.</i>

60
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,461
<i>Something that is forbidden
suddenly appeared in front of her.</i>

61
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,756
You said they're combat-type Homunculi.

62
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,718
They don't possess emotions
or consciousness like you do?

63
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,428
They don't.

64
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,221
<i>They're only after us</i>

65
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:08,767
<i>to complete the order
to exterminate all those who escaped.</i>

66
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:10,561
<i>I see.</i>

67
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,605
<i>That means we'll have to defeat them.</i>

68
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,358
<i>Although they're Homunculi…</i>

69
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,485
<i>No, it's precisely so…</i>

70
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,281
<i>Because they might be able</i>

71
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:26,243
<i>to laugh or cry like Luna…</i>

72
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,537
Can't you bring yourself to do it?

73
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,747
Amon.

74
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,750
In the end, they are merely puppets

75
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:37,463
bestowed a semblance of life.

76
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,631
<i>Her words are cold,</i>

77
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,925
<i>but she must have said them
for my peace of mind.</i>

78
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,223
<i>Their movements don't seem very swift.</i>

79
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,979
<i>They can still attack
even after losing a limb.</i>

80
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,399
<i>This is indeed something
only a Homunculus could do.</i>

81
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,242
<i>I won't be able to block it.</i>

82
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:10,954
<i>It's different from before.</i>

83
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,832
<i>Is it because I still have
my shield force?</i>

84
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,709
<i>I feel much lighter than usual.</i>

85
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,134
Finally, it's over.

86
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:26,637
Rud, I've healed them.

87
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:29,014
Um,

88
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,268
your friend is
in something like a house of ours.

89
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:34,937
Will you come too?

90
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:39,399
<i>Some look uneasy,
while others are filled with hostility.</i>

91
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:40,984
<i>They really are quite different.</i>

92
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:42,736
<i>It's no wonder…</i>

93
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,948
<i>The way they're dressed,
they must've been treated very inhumanely.</i>

94
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:48,575
<i>It's likely they hate humans.</i>

95
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,993
Um…

96
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:52,079
If you'll let us,

97
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,914
can we come with you?

98
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:57,376
{\an8}Honestly,
I'm not the biggest fan of humans.

99
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,170
But some of us are wounded,

100
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:03,257
and we have nowhere else to go.

101
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,639
<i>We brought the Homunculi we rescued</i>

102
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,142
<i>to the clan house.</i>

103
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,186
That settles it for now.

104
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,356
We can protect them here,
but what do you plan to do next?

105
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:22,901
They're Homunculi from Brunn Quelez.

106
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,071
{\an8}Then we must inform the governor
at the lord's mansion.

107
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,366
{\an8}The information will reach
the upper echelons of the country.

108
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,660
We might not be able to protect them.

109
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:35,330
And the townsfolk
might also be wary of them.

110
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,623
I know.

111
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,960
Fortunately, the governor
of Avancia is kind.

112
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:42,671
He will hear us out, at the very least.

113
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,174
Um…

114
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:47,676
Thank you for helping us.

115
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,553
My name is Fia.

116
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,806
Are you visiting the local authorities?

117
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,183
Yes.

118
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,059
Can I come with you?

119
00:07:56,894 --> 00:08:00,189
{\an8}It might be easier for a party involved
to speak to them.

120
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:04,318
{\an8}They probably want to know
about the situation in Brunn Quelez too.

121
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,279
But they might get scared.

122
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:10,574
Well, you can tie up my hands and feet.

123
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,286
I'm not one not to repay my debts.

124
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,915
I'll tell you everything I can.

125
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,667
I see.

126
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,253
But there's no need
to tie up your hands and feet.

127
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25,881
In that case…

128
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,801
I've never seen her before.

129
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:33,180
I heard people with magic stones
on them were brought to the clan house.

130
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,682
That girl with Mr. Rud…

131
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,601
Is she a Homunculus?

132
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,186
Is this really all right?

133
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,231
Um, Rud…

134
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,148
Yes?

135
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,068
I asked you to hold my hand
as a safety precaution,

136
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,362
but we've certainly
attracted a lot of attention.

137
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,990
I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

138
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:53,283
I don't think that at all.

139
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,161
I'm the one who should apologize.

140
00:08:56,245 --> 00:09:00,165
The people of Avancia
have never seen a Homunculus.

141
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,293
But they don't mean any ill intent.

142
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,836
It's okay. I don't mind.

143
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:07,756
We were prepared

144
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,841
before we left that country.

145
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:11,802
I see.

146
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,141
{\an8}Also, you don't have to force yourself
to smile.

147
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,894
{\an8}At least not when you're with me.

148
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:23,397
{\an8}Okay.

149
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,318
I see. I understand what happened.

150
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:34,074
It's been hard on you, Fia.

151
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:39,746
So that country is creating Homunculi.

152
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,749
Were you already aware of this, sir?

153
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,835
Only rumors.

154
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,797
I hear they do not treat
the Homunculi kindly.

155
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:53,468
Can I shelter them in this town
to protect them?

156
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,928
To protect them?

157
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,013
Of course,

158
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:58,557
them having nowhere else to go is
one of the reasons.

159
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,892
But more importantly, if they stay,

160
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:03,687
they may solve the problem
of the lack of manpower.

161
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,607
Are you planning to hire the Homunculi?

162
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,774
Precisely.

163
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,693
They possess their own will

164
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,362
and can act accordingly.

165
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,325
You make a fair point.

166
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:18,327
I could tell
just by looking at this child.

167
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,288
They're nothing different from humans

168
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,123
and they're expressive.

169
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,670
<i>Well then, Fia, I have some questions.</i>

170
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,589
When it comes to the Homunculi,

171
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,467
Commander-type with thinking ability
and self-awareness

172
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,553
<i>and combat-type
with enhanced combat skills.</i>

173
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:39,556
<i>Besides these, there seem
to be various types of Homunculi.</i>

174
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,768
By chance do you know the reason

175
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,936
for such advancement
of Homunculi technology?

176
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:46,605
Well,

177
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:50,275
<i>it's said that about 20 years ago,</i>

178
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:53,362
<i>a man known as Demon Lord Greed
appeared in Brunn Quelez.</i>

179
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,738
A demon lord?

180
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,990
We all thought demon lords were fictional.

181
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,784
Why would he appear in Brunn Quelez?

182
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,952
I don't know the exact reason,

183
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:06,249
but it seems that the remarkable
development of Homunculus technology

184
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,001
is attributed to Demon Lord Greed.

185
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:12,923
{\an8}Even now, they continue
to mass-produce Homunculi like us.

186
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:16,843
I understand the general situation.

187
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,721
I'll convey this information
to higher-ups.

188
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,849
Furthermore, we will provide
your group protection in Avancia.

189
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,435
Thank you very much!

190
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,481
{\an8}Looks like we get to stay in town
for the time being.

191
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,233
Yes.

192
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:35,028
But in a way, you guys
are also being monitored.

193
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:36,154
I understand.

194
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:37,572
By the way,

195
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:41,451
wasn't there a girl who could hold her own
against a combat-type Homunculus?

196
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,745
Samimina?

197
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,457
She's pretty tough
for a commander-type Homunculus.

198
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,628
<i>If anything were to happen,
she could be a formidable force.</i>

199
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,880
She's not the friendliest,

200
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:56,091
but she genuinely cares for her friends.

201
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,343
I can see that.

202
00:11:59,052 --> 00:11:59,970
CHUCKLE

203
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,390
Some of our kind resent humans

204
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,434
because of the horrors we've suffered.

205
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,811
But you helped us and let us know

206
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:12,732
<i>that there are human beings out there
who will treat Homunculi kindly.</i>

207
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:15,902
<i>Everyone should have realized that too.</i>

208
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,612
So,

209
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:20,407
even though they might not
let their guard down immediately,

210
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,367
everyone will surely understand one day.

211
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,077
That's true.

212
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,540
<i>What can I do</i>

213
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,584
<i>to help them?</i>

214
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,795
That's the situation.

215
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,132
All of you will be allowed to stay
in town for protection.

216
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,091
So,

217
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:41,094
I'm hoping you can do something
to help the town.

218
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,096
Can you tell me what you're good at?

219
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,432
I'm not sure if we're good at it,

220
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,559
but in Brunn Quelez,
we made clothes, weapons,

221
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:49,561
or built facilities that are insufficient.

222
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:51,897
We have also built towns.

223
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,231
That's very impressive.

224
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,025
Seems you are skilled in many things.

225
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:59,154
But Samimina's better at fighting
than making things.

226
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,074
No… I don't want to work.

227
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,869
We'll be abused again.

228
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,204
They'll beat us with whips.

229
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,122
I don't want to work for humans.

230
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:10,665
<i>I almost forgot</i>

231
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:14,377
<i>that they used to work
under terrible conditions.</i>

232
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,172
<i>I have to quell their anxieties first.</i>

233
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:21,051
It's work, but never more than
a reasonable number of hours.

234
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,594
How long is that?

235
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,764
Normally, it should be
from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

236
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,474
You get breaks as well, of course.

237
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,601
-That's…
-So short!

238
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,560
I can't believe it!

239
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,021
-We even get breaks?
-We won't be yelled at, will we?

240
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:35,941
<i>It seems their previous
working environment was really harsh.</i>

241
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,986
We'll decide the details
of the job and the hours later.

242
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,905
Anyway, thank you all very much.

243
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,282
What's wrong?

244
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,867
It's just that…

245
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,830
People don't thank Homunculi,
so that was a little surprising.

246
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,165
I see.

247
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,961
Work for the Homunculi?

248
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:58,588
In that case, how about this?

249
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,465
We'll build a public bathhouse.

250
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,591
Sounds good.

251
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,678
We've gotten requests for a theatre
and more guards too,

252
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,346
but a bathhouse might be better.

253
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,849
Those adventurers could certainly use it.

254
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,061
Some of them are rather unhygienic…

255
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:16,189
The public bathhouse it is, then.

256
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:19,276
Manicia, could I have you write up
the proposal to the governor?

257
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:20,193
Certainly.

258
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:24,155
By the way,

259
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,534
don't you think Luna's been acting
a little strange lately?

260
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,577
Has she?

261
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,494
Yes.

262
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,292
Can I stay with the Homunculi
at the clan house for a while?

263
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:39,129
She seemed very concerned
about the Homunculi.

264
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,047
She didn't leave the second floor today.

265
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:44,509
Does she have some sort of attachment
towards the Homunculi?

266
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,765
Luna.

267
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,767
Master.

268
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:53,977
Let me give you a hand.

269
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,604
Did something happen?

270
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,857
Hmm, well, how should I put it?

271
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,318
I wanted to talk to you.

272
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,613
Since the Homunculi came to Avancia,

273
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:06,573
you've been quite busy.

274
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,450
So, I was thinking, um…

275
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:10,994
It might be good for us
to have a chat once in a while.

276
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:12,037
Of course.

277
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,957
Although it's been decided
to build a public bathhouse,

278
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,543
can they still stay here
once it's finished?

279
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,253
Will they be dismissed

280
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,588
after it's done?

281
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,756
Don't worry.

282
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,301
The higher-ups have decided
to leave me in charge of everything.

283
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,219
I see.

284
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:29,763
Luna, are you okay?

285
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:33,058
You've been spending a lot of time
with the Homunculi lately.

286
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:35,977
It seems you've also heard
about what happened in Brunn Quelez.

287
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:37,979
Yes.

288
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,566
I feel so grateful and fortunate

289
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:44,069
to be brought back by Master.

290
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:49,449
<i>Maybe Luna doesn't remember much
about life in that country.</i>

291
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,703
<i>It must've been quite a shock to learn
what happened to the other Homunculi.</i>

292
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:57,123
Speaking of which,

293
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,626
have you told them

294
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,045
that you're a Homunculus?

295
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:04,839
No, I haven't told any of them.

296
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,675
If I told them,

297
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,803
it might cause you trouble.

298
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,096
I see.

299
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,557
I keep missing the timing
to tell them as well.

300
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,977
It'd be better if we could tell them soon.

301
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,269
Yes.

302
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:19,896
But…

303
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,401
<i>someday, when the people in town
aren't afraid of the Homunculi anymore,</i>

304
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,277
<i>I'll tell them my real identity.</i>

305
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,240
I want them to live happily
as soon as possible,

306
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,701
so I will do my best.

307
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,078
Mm. Everything will work out.

308
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,080
I know you can do it.

309
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,166
I'm really glad

310
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,793
I helped you.

311
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,586
Master…

312
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,179
{\an8}Thank you very much.

313
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,059
<i>To solve the problem
faced by Luna and the other Homunculi,</i>

314
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:01,021
<i>there is something I must find out.</i>

315
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,815
And who are you looking for?

316
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,400
Amon, just the one I was looking…

317
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:06,860
Rud!

318
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:09,779
Did you make this long journey
just to find me?

319
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:13,742
Have I completely captivated you?

320
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,702
Hey! Don't cling to me!

321
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,370
Ouch…

322
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,538
Hey! Rud!

323
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:21,875
How can I be a role model for my students
if they see me in this state?

324
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:22,959
Students?

325
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,836
I've started teaching magic.

326
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:27,589
After all,
I have a lot of free time on my hands.

327
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:32,093
Things are hectic on my end. We could
use extra help for the construction…

328
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:35,013
Let the Homunculi
handle that kind of work.

329
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,349
I only do things that interest me.

330
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,064
They're all learning magic
from the demon lord herself.

331
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:46,566
They're future candidates for demon lords.

332
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,776
That's right.

333
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,403
I came to ask you about demon lords.

334
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,321
About me?

335
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,865
No, about Demon Lord Greed.

336
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:59,746
Apparently, it was him who brought
the Homunculi technology to Brunn Quelez.

337
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,543
That bloke has always
had a penchant for research.

338
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,671
Even if he knows a thing or two
about Homunculus technology,

339
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,215
it's nothing surprising.

340
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,384
Heard he's currently
mass-producing Homunculi.

341
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:15,220
Do you know what his purpose is?

342
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,722
Like, is he planning on invading
other countries?

343
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,349
He is probably the last person

344
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,101
who would consider such intentions.

345
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:22,227
Then why?

346
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,730
Probably just to pass the time.

347
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:29,234
Just to pass the time?

348
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,862
<i>Well, us demon lords
aren't exactly restricted by a lifespan.</i>

349
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:34,280
<i>Even if we die,</i>

350
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:37,617
<i>one day we'll resurrect
with the same appearance.</i>

351
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,285
<i>Immortal, some might say.</i>

352
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,122
I've heard that when you die,
you lose your memories

353
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:44,374
and come back to life somewhere else.

354
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:48,378
Although some can vaguely recall
their past memories,

355
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,755
most forget everything and simply live on.

356
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,258
That's how it is.

357
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,176
Since we demon lords don't die,

358
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,596
we look for matters to occupy our time.

359
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:02,350
So, manufacturing Homunculi
is Greed's pastime

360
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,394
to while away his lengthy existence?

361
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,896
Not exactly.

362
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,360
<i>Greed has always sought
to create "the strongest."</i>

363
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,071
<i>His research of the Homunculi
is most likely</i>

364
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,949
<i>one of his many studies.</i>

365
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,868
"To create the strongest"?

366
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,495
I suppose

367
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:26,374
the illegal Homunculi are the closest
to being the "strongest."

368
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,752
You're one to talk,
being the closest to the "strongest."

369
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,881
The power you possess is something

370
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:37,135
that even Greed,
after years of research, cannot obtain.

371
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,471
Strengthened by mana,
the power of the demon lord.

372
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:43,183
Enhanced by shield force,
the power of god.

373
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:46,352
Possess both, and only then
does one become the strongest.

374
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:48,646
This is the conclusion
that Greed has reached.

375
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,567
Didn't you use it when you fought me?

376
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,153
<i>The power at that time?</i>

377
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:59,073
Now I understand
that Greed is pursuing the "strongest."

378
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,535
But why create the Homunculi?

379
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:06,456
<i>Most probably
to experiment on their bodies.</i>

380
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,001
<i>He created Luna and those Homunculi</i>

381
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:12,837
<i>just to use them as his test subjects?</i>

382
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:17,258
<i>He put them through all that suffering
just for his research?</i>

383
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,219
<i>You've got to be kidding me!</i>

384
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:21,179
Are you angry?

385
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,430
Of course, I am!

386
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,891
Those kids have feelings.

387
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,769
How can I overlook
the atrocities he committed?

388
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,939
What labyrinth is Greed in now?

389
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,691
What? Are you going to take him down?

390
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,109
He's a very powerful man.

391
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,612
With your current strength,

392
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,198
you might not be able to defeat
Greed at all his might.

393
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,579
And even if you do want to defeat him,
your "strongest" power can be troublesome.

394
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:50,250
<i>Magic elements come from monsters.</i>

395
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,418
<i>Used excessively,</i>

396
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,963
one's body could become closer
to that of a demon.

397
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,674
Are you telling me to avoid using it?

398
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,676
You should learn to control it.

399
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,388
Those who cannot control mana
will become monsters.

400
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,681
However,

401
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:06,349
control it well

402
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,852
and you might just turn into a demon lord.

403
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,480
I have no interest

404
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,065
in becoming a demon lord.

405
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:15,775
I see.

406
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:19,237
Well, it's almost time for my lesson.

407
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,364
Let's talk another day, Rud.

408
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,622
{\an8}<i>In order to protect everyone
when Greed attacks,</i>

409
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,458
<i>I have to become stronger.</i>

410
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,676
<i>Destroy it.</i>
