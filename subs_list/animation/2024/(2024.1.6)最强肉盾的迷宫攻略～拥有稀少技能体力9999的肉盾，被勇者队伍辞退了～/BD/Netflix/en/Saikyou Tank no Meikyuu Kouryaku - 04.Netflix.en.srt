1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:03,379
Nothing in the news today either?

2
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:09,010
<i>A monster with two magic stones,</i>

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,346
<i>what could it be?</i>

4
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:14,807
Good morning, Big Brother.

5
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:16,726
Good morning, Manicia.

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,939
Will you read the newspaper to me, please?

7
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:25,151
I thought you were good at reading.

8
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:28,237
Read to me, please?

9
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:31,032
<i>A spoiled Manicia</i>

10
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:32,825
<i>is too cute!</i>

11
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:38,456
I heard there are
a lot of new labyrinths popping up lately.

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,999
I see.

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:44,462
"Avancia might see
the emergence of a labyrinth too," huh?

14
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,672
<i>Speaking of which, a few days ago…</i>

15
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,675
<i>If we get a labyrinth around here,</i>

16
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,678
<i>this town will prosper.</i>

17
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,100
This one's about
the economic situation in the capital.

18
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,311
This one's about the new system.

19
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,313
{\an8}And this one…

20
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,691
"Former hero Kygras is off
to conquer a new labyrinth."

21
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:09,445
You used to be in the same party, right?

22
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:10,571
Yes.

23
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:13,866
Miss Nin said she couldn't stand him

24
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,910
because he always looked down on you.

25
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,956
<i>Nin's words usually come
with a lot of personal feelings.</i>

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,333
{\an8}That's surprising.

27
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,920
{\an8}Big Brother, you've noticed
her feelings for you, haven't you?

28
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:29,256
Did you pretend not to notice

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,217
because of my illness?

30
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:38,140
It's one of the things I considered,

31
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,810
but the real issue lies with me.

32
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,147
I'm not strong.

33
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:47,441
Once I get close to someone,

34
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,652
I'll become fixated on that relationship,

35
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:52,738
and I won't be able to focus
on raiding labyrinths.

36
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,033
I'm not skilled.

37
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:59,203
I can't juggle both.

38
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,666
But I think if it were you,
it would be okay.

39
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:06,627
So,

40
00:02:07,169 --> 00:02:09,839
if someone you care about
shows up one day,

41
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,799
please continue to take care of me

42
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,553
while you pursue your happiness.

43
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,472
Sure.

44
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,349
That's a given.

45
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:55,986
Everyone,

46
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,239
I've gathered you here today

47
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:03,494
to defeat the Chameleon Kong
that was spotted a few days ago.

48
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,998
<i>The Chameleon Kong resides
in a region further south from here.</i>

49
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,334
It's hard to imagine how it managed

50
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:12,753
to come to Avancia
without being noticed by anyone.

51
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,172
That's why we'll also need

52
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:18,008
to investigate why it appeared here.

53
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,429
I'd like to express my gratitude
to all of you for assisting.

54
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:24,974
Incidentally,

55
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,476
there are suspicions
that the Chameleon Kong

56
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,311
could have escaped from a labyrinth.

57
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,272
If any of you come across the entrance,

58
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,065
please report it to me immediately.

59
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:33,983
Oh?

60
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,068
Is that…

61
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,569
This thing?

62
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,948
I had the skilled father-daughter
blacksmith duo make a new sword for me.

63
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,117
Rud, your new sword is ready.

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,327
I polished your shield for you too.

65
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,956
<i>As far as swords go,
it's an excellent weapon,</i>

66
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,166
<i>but this one even comes
with the Enchant skill.</i>

67
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,543
<i>Impressive.</i>

68
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,420
<i>What's Enchant?</i>

69
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,047
<i>It lets you alter the magical properties
of a magic stone</i>

70
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,882
<i>and infuse them into the weapon.</i>

71
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:01,844
It should be quicker to show you.

72
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,555
I can use magic of all attributes,

73
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,849
but none of them
are powerful enough as attacks.

74
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:07,808
However,

75
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,935
by infusing magic into this magic stone…

76
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:15,232
I can turn the sword
into a fire-attribute weapon.

77
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,360
{\an8}<i>In other words,
I can alter the weapon's attributes</i>

78
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,696
{\an8}<i>depending on the monsters' weaknesses.</i>

79
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,156
I see.

80
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,076
You're an F-rank, aren't you?

81
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,078
Giving that to you seems like a waste.

82
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,913
Hey, don't be like that.

83
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,458
You're a C-rank?

84
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:33,834
That's right.

85
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:37,046
Even such a nice sword is useless
since you're just an F-rank.

86
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,839
You might as well head back home now,

87
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,049
old man.

88
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,135
What… What's the deal
with that adventurer?

89
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,637
Master, are you just going to take that?

90
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,347
Calm down, Luna.

91
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,725
It's better to be underestimated

92
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,310
than overestimated.

93
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,354
That may be true,

94
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:58,400
but I don't like it
when they belittle you.

95
00:05:58,484 --> 00:05:59,651
See?

96
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,488
This is what happens
when you refuse to update your rank.

97
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,240
Even though you're strong enough
that even I, a saint,

98
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,701
would want to nominate you as a knight.

99
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,746
Saint Nin, is that true?

100
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,664
Yes, but he refused.

101
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:13,874
Why?

102
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,043
Because once your rank goes up,

103
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,462
sometimes the guild calls you in for help.

104
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,424
<i>And besides, I only became an adventurer
in the first place</i>

105
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,218
<i>to cure Manicia.</i>

106
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,017
It's the Chameleon Kong!

107
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,185
It's coming from above!

108
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,190
What?

109
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,536
That girl's got skills.

110
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:51,453
Yes.

111
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:54,039
Fil is far better
than your ordinary adventurer.

112
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,625
Taunt.

113
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:14,184
<i>Every blow is heavy, but…</i>

114
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,314
<i>No one has been hit.</i>

115
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:21,400
<i>And we've been consistently attacking it.</i>

116
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,652
Everyone, let's bring it down!

117
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,572
<i>But something doesn't feel right.</i>

118
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,490
<i>Bold and blatant attacks,</i>

119
00:07:28,574 --> 00:07:30,534
<i>roaring as if it's trying
to draw attention…</i>

120
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,745
<i>In human society, we call this a tank.</i>

121
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,463
What? There were others?

122
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:43,505
Nobody told me that!

123
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:44,965
Everyone, dodge!

124
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,219
A monster capable

125
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,138
of using diversion.

126
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,725
<i>We've been surrounded.</i>

127
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,935
<i>What do we do?</i>

128
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,105
{\an8}<i>This… This is beyond my capability.</i>

129
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:01,315
{\an8}Fil,

130
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,859
if the leader is scared,
everyone will be affected.

131
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,737
{\an8}Leader?

132
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,656
{\an8}Yes, aren't you our leader?

133
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:11,533
{\an8}That's right.

134
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,328
Surely you can break through this.

135
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,245
I can.

136
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,748
Let's do this again!

137
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,042
Taunt!

138
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,337
Get back in formation!

139
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,340
It's too dangerous
to fight three monsters all at once!

140
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,513
Don't think
you can take me down with this!

141
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:38,560
I'll make you regret

142
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,646
attacking Master!

143
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:41,647
Wind Sword!

144
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,817
Finish it off!

145
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,653
Let's do this!

146
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,785
It should be fine to leave that to them.

147
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:55,702
Next…

148
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:01,416
I remember
Chameleon Kongs are weak to fire.

149
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,127
Enchant: Fire Attribute.

150
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,094
Not bad.

151
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,428
I'll leave the rest to you.

152
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,388
Got it.

153
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,019
The vigilante corps will take care of it!

154
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,703
-Luna!
-Yes!

155
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,038
Wind Sword!

156
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:46,378
I won't let you escape.

157
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:55,095
With this, it's over.

158
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,317
Is everyone all right?

159
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,486
We defeated the Chameleon Kong!

160
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,487
We didn't.

161
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:15,490
If it weren't for Rud,
we wouldn't have been able to do anything.

162
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,951
That's true.

163
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,998
We finished up ours too.

164
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:24,583
Good.

165
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,211
To not be scared in that situation,
are you some kind of monster?

166
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,338
As a tank,

167
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:31,548
it's moments like those
that I can't back down.

168
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,216
I see…

169
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,012
Um, I'm sorry I looked down on you.

170
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,640
It's no big deal.

171
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,768
After all, rank represents
an adventurer's strength.

172
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,896
A low-ranking adventurer is bound
to draw second guesses.

173
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:03,914
{\an8}<i>The way it died is just like
the monsters in the labyrinth.</i>

174
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,083
{\an8}Rud, look over there.

175
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,256
Is that… the entrance to the labyrinth?

176
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,849
A… Avancia has a labyrinth now.

177
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,727
To the future prosperity of the town…

178
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,604
Cheers!

179
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,523
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

180
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,608
-Things are going to be busy.
-Bring it on.

181
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,443
Thank you for your assistance.

182
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,865
It's a big party tonight.

183
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:39,866
That's right.

184
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,660
With the appearance of the labyrinth,

185
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:44,079
we might solve the problem
of declining population.

186
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:46,456
That would be wonderful, Master.

187
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,250
Indeed…

188
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,377
Manicia.

189
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,838
Would you like to have a drink with me?

190
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,674
Do you have a death wish?

191
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,468
If you're lonely, I'll drink with you.

192
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,429
-My apologies.
-It sure is lively.

193
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:01,930
Miss Nin.

194
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,390
Are you enjoying yourself?

195
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,891
{\an8}Yes, very much.

196
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:09,229
{\an8}But Master doesn't seem
all too happy about this.

197
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:13,066
Understandable, there are pros and cons
to the appearance of a labyrinth.

198
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,776
He must be worried about that.

199
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,944
Is that so?

200
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,279
Yes.

201
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,072
It can bring about several problems.

202
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:22,534
If no one eliminates
the monsters in the labyrinth,

203
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:26,413
they will escape
like Chameleon Kongs did today.

204
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,832
Labyrinths that frequently experience
such incidents

205
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:31,334
are considered a threat
to the nearby residents.

206
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,462
But when such incidents occur,

207
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:36,131
why not just go and defeat them,
like we did this morning?

208
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,967
Doing that would create other problems.

209
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:43,346
Because anyone can become an adventurer.

210
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,766
It means even someone despicable and evil
can become one.

211
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,977
<i>There are quite a few of those</i>

212
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,189
<i>that behave like stalkers,
going after cute girls.</i>

213
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:53,815
<i>And</i>

214
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,443
<i>you and Manicia
might become their targets.</i>

215
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,156
In that case, is there any way
to manage these adventurers?

216
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,657
That's where the clans come in.

217
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:04,868
What's a "clan"?

218
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:06,495
A clan, in essence,

219
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,372
is an organization
that brings together multiple parties.

220
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,082
Adventurers affiliated with a clan

221
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:14,002
receive official recognition
from the country and are obligated

222
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,921
to protect the towns, like knights.

223
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,631
After all,

224
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,342
adventurers want security too.

225
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,010
Without a clan,

226
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,804
the entire town could descend into chaos,

227
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:28,600
particularly in a town like Avancia,
where combatants are limited.

228
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,435
Without a clan stationed,

229
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,231
adventurers might cause
trouble in the town.

230
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,526
<i>If anything were to happen to Manicia…</i>

231
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,238
Don't look so glum.

232
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,657
I'll help you guys as well.

233
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,700
Rud!

234
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,957
So soothing…

235
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,793
-Stop, Fil! The shield force's going to…
-Good boy…

236
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,128
-It hurts…
-I just want to pet you…

237
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,839
Fil, you're drunk!

238
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:02,717
You jerk!

239
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,261
Were you staring at me?

240
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,679
Are you asking for it?

241
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,014
Are you two

242
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:09,849
fighting again?

243
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,144
-I'm sorry!
-I'm sorry!

244
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,440
Good job on patrol.

245
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,653
Didn't expect so many adventurers
to show up

246
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:24,906
just a week after the labyrinth appeared.

247
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,074
Exactly.

248
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,617
Mister Rud,

249
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,078
thanks again for last time.

250
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,456
Rud, if anything happens again,
we'll be counting on you.

251
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,460
I heard you've been helping around town.

252
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,338
Well, one-sided restrictions won't work.

253
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,883
There's a fight going on over there!

254
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:43,925
This way!

255
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,142
Black Dragon Fang's No.3, Bu,

256
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,437
and White Tiger Claw's No.3, Gali.

257
00:14:56,104 --> 00:15:00,483
They're both A-rank adventurers. If they
start fighting, it could be dangerous.

258
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:03,820
Hold it.

259
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,156
You're scaring the townsfolk.

260
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,241
Could you please stop?

261
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,160
Who are you?

262
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:13,121
The pride of our clans is
on the line here.

263
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,831
Why don't you stay out of this?

264
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,042
You aren't backing down, huh?

265
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:20,795
Why don't you decide, then?

266
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,131
Whether Black Dragon Fang
or White Tiger Claw

267
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,717
will establish themselves in this town.

268
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,553
We don't want either of you
if you're going to cause trouble.

269
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,721
Why don't you go back?

270
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,432
You!

271
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,893
Don't you dare treat Mister Bu
in such a rude manner!

272
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:40,732
And don't even think about trying.

273
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:44,277
Unlike Rud, I won't be showing any mercy.

274
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,365
This town has its own rules.

275
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,576
I'm willing to go all the way
if you try anything here.

276
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,038
Sorry.

277
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,373
We're sorry, too.

278
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,166
By the way,

279
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,751
do you belong to a clan?

280
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,503
-If not, won't you join us?
-Beat it!

281
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,755
This guy belongs with us,
the Black Dragon Fang!

282
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:04,673
Black Dragon.

283
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,257
-White Tiger.
-Black Dragon.

284
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:07,300
White Tiger.

285
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,678
I'll be joining neither.

286
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,346
That's enough.

287
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,889
Welcome to Avancia.

288
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,061
<i>Knowing when to call it quits,</i>

289
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,522
<i>adventurers affiliated with clans</i>

290
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,524
<i>are different from non-affiliated ones.</i>

291
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:26,569
<i>But it looks like I won't be able
to leave town for a while.</i>

292
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,572
{\an8}I can't believe they invited you
to join their clans.

293
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,490
Same.

294
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,952
<i>I used to aspire to join a clan too.</i>

295
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:36,329
<i>Dreamed of one day</i>

296
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,957
<i>living the adventurer life in a clan,
like a big family.</i>

297
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,875
Rud!

298
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,460
Has the conflict been resolved?

299
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:43,712
It's all settled.

300
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,756
Well then,
you should head to the headquarters.

301
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,341
Mister Vild needs to see you.

302
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,592
Mister Vild?

303
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,304
In light of the situation in Avancia,

304
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:55,265
the lord has two proposals.

305
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,183
The lord, you say?

306
00:16:57,267 --> 00:17:01,438
He asked me to choose
one of the two proposals.

307
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,523
The first proposal is…

308
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,525
Rud,

309
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:09,446
you must establish a clan
and become the clan leader.

310
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,655
Me?

311
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:13,366
Why, all of a sudden…

312
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,617
It's not sudden.

313
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:18,663
He has been mentioning you
quite frequently since some time ago,

314
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,915
talking about a young
and talented adventurer.

315
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,003
I appreciate the lord's recognition,

316
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:28,840
but taking on such a role doesn't suit me
as I will be occupied

317
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,467
with finding a cure for Manicia.

318
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:31,509
I understand.

319
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,427
However…

320
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,847
<i>that is the wish of the town.</i>

321
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,849
<i>Even though you have no experience,</i>

322
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,477
<i>the people would rather it be you
than some stranger.</i>

323
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,105
<i>I'm truly grateful to have their trust.</i>

324
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,192
<i>When Manicia is cured,</i>

325
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,360
<i>I'd like to live in peace
in this town too.</i>

326
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,114
<i>I'd like to do something
for the town, too, but…</i>

327
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:55,784
The second proposal is…

328
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,787
<i>to destroy the labyrinth in Avancia.</i>

329
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,123
But then, the development of the town…

330
00:18:02,207 --> 00:18:05,960
There are so many labyrinths
appearing all across the country now

331
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,463
that they cannot manage all of them,

332
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:10,632
including Avancia's labyrinth.

333
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:15,178
The higher-ups seem to be averse
to adding more unmanageable labyrinths.

334
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:19,808
So, if you can't establish a clan,

335
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,644
they hope you can join a party
to investigate the labyrinth

336
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,522
and work together to destroy it.

337
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,067
I'm sorry, but could you make the choice?

338
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,821
To become a clan leader
and manage the town and labyrinth

339
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,864
or to destroy the labyrinth,

340
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,616
please make the decision.

341
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,084
I won't ask you to decide now,

342
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,043
but if possible,

343
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,337
I hope you can let me know
your answer soon.

344
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,089
Stinking thief!

345
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,508
You were going to steal from me!

346
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:54,884
I'm not a thief!

347
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,553
It was just a mistake!

348
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,929
Hey, stop it!

349
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:58,847
Shut up!

350
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,766
You're just an adventurer.
Don't interfere!

351
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:06,813
<i>The only way to resolve this situation is
to establish a clan, huh?</i>

352
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,148
Found you!

353
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,149
Master!

354
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,443
Master, you must hurry home!

355
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,029
Lady Manicia…

356
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:21,411
Granny Gigi! How's Manicia?

357
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:23,913
Don't worry.

358
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:28,042
She's just a little sick, as usual.

359
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:29,127
Oh…

360
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,339
You're too much of a worrywart.

361
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:35,216
More importantly,

362
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,302
is the town doing okay?

363
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,846
You don't have to worry about that.

364
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:40,763
Rest well.

365
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,098
Okay.

366
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,938
{\an8}<i>If I become the leader of the clan,</i>

367
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,066
<i>I won't be able to leave Avancia
for extended periods</i>

368
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,404
<i>and won't be able
to explore labyrinths like before.</i>

369
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:01,576
{\an8}<i>I don't know if I can obtain a treasure
that can grant any wish for sure,</i>

370
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,370
{\an8}<i>but staying here</i>

371
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,872
{\an8}<i>won't save Manicia.</i>

372
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,458
Nin, Luna,

373
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,378
there's something
I'd like to ask for your help.

374
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,968
I…

375
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,970
I want to destroy Avancia's labyrinth.

376
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,640
Please lend me your support.

377
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,975
Are you sure about this?

378
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:27,894
Your choice

379
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,521
could ruin the town's prospects.

380
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:34,442
If I have to choose
between Manicia and the town,

381
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,904
I will choose Manicia.

382
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,325
Um…

383
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,244
Can I ask a question?

384
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,665
If Master becomes the clan leader,

385
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:53,294
do you have to stay in town?

386
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,631
If I take on the role of clan leader,

387
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,759
I'll likely have to stay until
the situation in Avancia stabilizes.

388
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,219
Is that the only solution?

389
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,263
Can't you find someone

390
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,683
to take on your duties while you're away?

391
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,143
No, even if that were possible,

392
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:10,979
I wouldn't feel right passing it to…

393
00:21:11,062 --> 00:21:12,021
I'll do it.

394
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,150
If I can stand in for Master
and protect this town,

395
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,610
I'll do it.

396
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:21,531
I love this town
that welcomed me and accepted me.

397
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:25,743
So, just like how Master helped me,

398
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:28,746
I want to do my best to help you too.

399
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,249
But…

400
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:33,710
Are you trying to hide
your true feelings again?

401
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:35,753
Nin…

402
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,715
Don't worry,
I'll be right here supporting Luna.

403
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,009
I was planning
to quit my role as a saint anyway.

404
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:41,926
The church…

405
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,596
is not thrilled,
but they respect my decision.

406
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,514
So,

407
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,891
let me join your clan and lend you a hand.

408
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,353
Why are you two doing this for me?

409
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:56,733
{\an8}There are many people
who are grateful to you.

410
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,193
{\an8}You've always protected them.

411
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:03,990
{\an8}It makes sense
that they'd want to return the favor too.

412
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,575
{\an8}It is as Miss Nin said.

413
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,535
{\an8}Is this really okay?

414
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,495
{\an8}Of course.

415
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,123
{\an8}So, don't look so defeated.

416
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,294
{\an8}Just do what you want.
You don't need to hold back.

417
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,089
{\an8}Big Brother.

418
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,008
{\an8}Manicia!

419
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,261
{\an8}You should be resting…

420
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,642
{\an8}I'm not the little girl

421
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:35,063
{\an8}who needs to rely on you
for everything anymore.

422
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:38,024
{\an8}Just like Miss Luna,

423
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,859
{\an8}I love this town very much.

424
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:44,447
{\an8}If you have the ability
to protect this town,

425
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:47,658
{\an8}I want you to keep it safe.

426
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:55,041
{\an8}After all, I'm in the pink of health.

427
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,754
{\an8}<i>No, you're not…</i>

428
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,465
{\an8}<i>Even you…</i>

429
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,470
{\an8}I take back what I said.

430
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,475
{\an8}I want to protect Manicia and this town.

431
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,603
{\an8}So, please help me.

432
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,271
{\an8}-Of course.
-Of course.
