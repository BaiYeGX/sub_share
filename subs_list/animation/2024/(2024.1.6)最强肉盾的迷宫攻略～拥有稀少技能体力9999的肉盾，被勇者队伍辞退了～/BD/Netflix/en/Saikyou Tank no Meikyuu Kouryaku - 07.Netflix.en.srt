1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:04,463
<i>To protect my clan and friends,</i>

2
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:06,298
<i>I must</i>

3
00:00:07,091 --> 00:00:08,759
{\an8}<i>conquer Keild Labyrinth.</i>

4
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:13,973
Rud.

5
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,225
Lily?

6
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:17,852
I have a favor to ask.

7
00:00:20,563 --> 00:00:21,647
Ow…

8
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:23,357
What's the big deal?

9
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,837
Please help me
with the straps on the back.

10
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,718
There, all done.

11
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,681
Thank you.

12
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:22,101
Now I can give Lilia a surprise service.

13
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:25,396
I see. I'll leave you to it then.

14
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,064
Wait.

15
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,276
There's something else I want to ask you.

16
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,738
Rud, you…

17
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,199
You'll do your best

18
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,993
as a clan leader, right?

19
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,202
Well, yes.

20
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:42,997
<i>You're amazing.</i>

21
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,000
<i>I thought so when you made
that declaration in front of everyone.</i>

22
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,669
I'm a coward.

23
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,463
I can't even tell other people
the things I want to do.

24
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:53,924
Is there something you want to do?

25
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:56,093
Promise you won't laugh?

26
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,052
Promise.

27
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:01,056
{\an8}I don't have any grand goals like you,

28
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,519
{\an8}but I don't want to let myself
rely on Lilia all the time.

29
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:08,939
I want to be able to stand on my own.

30
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,442
<i>When I'm with Lilia,</i>

31
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,402
<i>I never have to worry about anything.</i>

32
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,531
<i>Growing up, I've always been clumsy.
I always mess things up.</i>

33
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:21,160
<i>But Lilia would always be there for me.</i>

34
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,162
<i>Lilia is perfect</i>

35
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,122
<i>and she can do anything.</i>

36
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,583
<i>She's a fierce fighter.</i>

37
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,295
<i>And I can only support her from the rear.</i>

38
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,465
{\an8}Isn't that because you're good with magic?

39
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,133
<i>Lilia can use magic too,</i>

40
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,469
<i>but she fights close combat.</i>

41
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:40,512
<i>And when we use Fusion,</i>

42
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:43,349
<i>Lilia always takes control.</i>

43
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,686
<i>I've never fought on my own.</i>

44
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:49,855
<i>I see.</i>

45
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,399
<i>I always wondered who took control</i>

46
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:53,817
<i>when you guys fused.</i>

47
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,571
But, I can't always depend on Lilia.

48
00:03:57,655 --> 00:04:00,991
I want to stand on my own feet.

49
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,576
<i>I see.</i>

50
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,704
<i>That's why she approached me.</i>

51
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:09,208
<i>Given how close they are,
it may be hard to tell her sister</i>

52
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,918
<i>that she wants to be independent.</i>

53
00:04:12,962 --> 00:04:16,173
Lily, you can trouble me.

54
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,593
Go ahead and go after what you want to do.

55
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,845
Really?

56
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:25,641
Then I'll get your help
the next time I want to do something…

57
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,354
Lily?

58
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,273
I thought I heard Rud…

59
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:38,070
Lilia.

60
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,615
-Rud…
-It's not what it looks like, Lilia!

61
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,076
You've got it all wrong!
This is a misunderstanding!

62
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,291
Can you come to the roof with me?

63
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,881
<i>Is she going to push me off the roof?</i>

64
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,550
What are you afraid of?

65
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:01,969
Don't worry.

66
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,430
I'd have thrown him off
if it had been any other guy.

67
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:07,474
But you're not the kind of guy

68
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,854
that would ever hurt my precious sister.

69
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,481
That was just an act

70
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:16,233
to get you out here.

71
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:23,657
Have I told you about our past?

72
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,285
You said you were abandoned
by your parents

73
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,037
and have been traveling on your own.

74
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:32,458
Well, rather than say we were abandoned,

75
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:36,462
it would be more accurate to say
we ran away because we were being abused,

76
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,965
<i>mostly by our father.</i>

77
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,968
So what happened earlier was a surprise.

78
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:46,388
You're one of the few guys
she can communicate normally with.

79
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:50,893
That's why

80
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:53,771
I wanted to talk to you.

81
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,939
I want to take Lily

82
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:59,443
to a place where she can be happy.

83
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,906
Until then, no matter what happens,

84
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,908
I swear to protect her.

85
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,868
I see.

86
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:10,370
You two are very considerate
of each other.

87
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,873
Lily told me

88
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,375
she thought you were perfect and amazing.

89
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,587
I'm not as good as she thinks I am.

90
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,755
Right.

91
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,341
I don't think you're perfect either.

92
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,469
You lose your cool

93
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,638
whenever your sister is involved,

94
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,057
almost like you're a different person.

95
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,060
I don't want to hear that from you.

96
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,985
Thanks for hearing me out.

97
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:46,156
You're my companion, after all. You can
tell me if anything's bothering you.

98
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,577
Yeah. I'll be counting on you
when the time comes.

99
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,167
When's Lilia coming back?

100
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,091
Lilia, Lily, sorry to keep you waiting.

101
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,259
Not at all.

102
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:09,471
We just came back from the 49th floor.

103
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,974
<i>The 49th floor?</i>

104
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:12,975
<i>Yes.</i>

105
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:14,685
<i>I had the investigator</i>

106
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:16,270
<i>take me there beforehand</i>

107
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:20,858
<i>so I could use my Dungeon Walk
to take everyone there directly.</i>

108
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,901
<i>You're a lifesaver, Lily.</i>

109
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:23,861
<i>Not at all.</i>

110
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:24,778
<i>Also,</i>

111
00:07:24,862 --> 00:07:26,780
<i>the reason I didn't head to the 50th floor</i>

112
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,949
<i>was to assess the monsters' spawn rate.</i>

113
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:31,660
I've gathered quite some intel
on my end too.

114
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,456
First, the party composition
of the two clans.

115
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,666
Black Dragon Fang uses

116
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:40,085
four attackers including the leader

117
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,962
and two healers to support them.

118
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,466
<i>White Tiger Claw uses four magic attackers</i>

119
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:46,967
<i>and two healers.</i>

120
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,761
<i>In other words,
both clans focus primarily on speed.</i>

121
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:52,681
That's why they have
their attackers double as tanks.

122
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,058
<i>Regardless of floor,</i>

123
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,936
<i>it seems there is a high risk
of abnormal statuses.</i>

124
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,855
In that case, we can use

125
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,732
{\an8}my Strong Body to nullify that.

126
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,110
This is going to be
a challenging labyrinth,

127
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,697
but no matter what,
we will conquer the entire labyrinth

128
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,949
and form an alliance with the two clans.

129
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,410
-All right.
-All right.

130
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,872
I'll take the lead.

131
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,290
Marius will take the rear.

132
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,333
Okay.

133
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,460
Luna will handle close combat.

134
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,879
Lilia, as usual,
will move and act as she sees fit.

135
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,633
Nin will restore the shield force
and issue commands…

136
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,886
Is something the matter, Lily?

137
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,095
Um,

138
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,058
can I be the one to give commands
during battle?

139
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,062
<i>Already trying to make a change?</i>

140
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,105
I understand.

141
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,484
It might be easier for us if Lily could
oversee the battle from the rear.

142
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:48,862
Then Lily will be the main commander.
Nin will support her.

143
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:50,405
Got it.

144
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,991
I'm counting on you, Lily.

145
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,493
Sure.

146
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,746
Okay, let's go.

147
00:08:58,372 --> 00:08:59,456
Dungeon Walk!

148
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,881
<i>This space doesn't favor
those who rely on speed in combat.</i>

149
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,552
<i>But it's perfect for a tank like me.</i>

150
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,680
The spawn location set for the monsters
is around here.

151
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,349
It would seem so.

152
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,684
You can tell, too, Rud?

153
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,769
Only vaguely, though.

154
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,982
That's because you're the manager
of Avancia Labyrinth.

155
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:26,608
That's the reason?

156
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:29,361
They've set it up quite cleverly.

157
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:33,991
{\an8}These two paths

158
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,159
{\an8}lead to the same place,

159
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,663
{\an8}but monsters will appear on both.

160
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,873
{\an8}Say, we take the left
and encounter monsters,

161
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:45,544
{\an8}then the monsters from the right
will also come at us from behind.

162
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:48,297
{\an8}So, they're trying to trap us?

163
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,881
{\an8}Exactly.

164
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:50,966
{\an8}The guardian here

165
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:52,801
{\an8}is a cunning one.

166
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,141
It's the Poison Lizard!

167
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:02,019
The Black Owl is coming from the right!

168
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,479
Sacrificial Shield!

169
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:05,939
Taunt!

170
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:11,403
Poison gas?

171
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:17,367
Sorry…

172
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,831
but abnormal statuses won't work on me.

173
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,590
It defended with its magic?

174
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:48,982
More Black Owls!

175
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,777
Rud,

176
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,570
we can take them,

177
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,572
but we shouldn't waste energy here.

178
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,865
You're right.

179
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,575
You guys keep going.

180
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,035
Leave it to me.

181
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:00,952
Got it.

182
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,537
Everyone, this way!

183
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,792
Flash magic stone!

184
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,259
Lily, your commands were on point.

185
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,677
They were easy to understand.

186
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:19,971
I'll continue to do my best.

187
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,976
By the way, I just realized something.

188
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,686
Rud's Sacrificial Shield,

189
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:30,273
I think we can decide whether
to transfer the damage to you or not.

190
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,692
Yes, I noticed that too.

191
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,694
We couldn't do that before.

192
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,988
Your skill level must have gone up

193
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,282
after you fought me!

194
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,575
Maybe…

195
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,787
It's all thanks to me!

196
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,540
That means we can disable
the damage absorption

197
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,750
whenever we want.

198
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,170
But Rud's skills are certainly something.

199
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,258
It's rare to see a tank

200
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,385
that can perfectly distract the enemy.

201
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,761
That's true.

202
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,973
I used to think all tanks could do that.

203
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,058
Rud's just
on a completely different level.

204
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:06,852
Even if you say that…

205
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,478
It'd be great

206
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:12,399
if you could pick up
the Self Recovery skill too.

207
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,068
That sounds like another difficult thing.

208
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,987
Does such a skill even exist?

209
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,573
What? So humans don't know about this?

210
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,825
"Humans"?

211
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,952
Are you not one yourself?

212
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:27,414
Um, not entirely?

213
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:28,665
Incidentally,

214
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,500
we don't really know much about you.

215
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:31,918
That's true.

216
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,463
We risked our lives
to fight you last time,

217
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:37,090
but now you're not giving off
any malicious intent, so…

218
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:38,717
It completely slipped our minds.

219
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:43,180
Marius, if you don't mind,
would you tell us more about yourself?

220
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,557
Only what you're comfortable with,
of course.

221
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,606
I was worried whether or not
you guys would accept me.

222
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:54,983
Actually…

223
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,360
I am a demigod.

224
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,825
A demigod?

225
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,285
Yes.

226
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,078
<i>Broadly speaking,</i>

227
00:13:07,162 --> 00:13:10,207
<i>the world consists
of humans and demihumans.</i>

228
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,168
<i>It is said that in the past,
there were even demigods.</i>

229
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:16,171
<i>Demigods and demihumans
do not differ much in appearance,</i>

230
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:21,760
<i>but those who worship the devil
instead of god are called demigods.</i>

231
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,262
That's the gist of it.

232
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,016
I can oversee the labyrinth
because I am a demigod.

233
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,351
What does that mean?

234
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,477
You didn't know?

235
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,898
It may seem as if humans
are benefitting from labyrinths,

236
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,358
but labyrinths were created

237
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:40,111
by the devil to destroy the human world
in the first place.

238
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:41,446
What?

239
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:47,577
So, labyrinths weren't created by god
to enrich our lives?

240
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,871
Where did you get that from?

241
00:13:51,248 --> 00:13:53,375
Well, it's like a folklore.

242
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:54,584
Indeed.

243
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:59,005
There might have been those
who knew the truth in the past.

244
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,758
Anyway, that's the story.

245
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,970
So, this labyrinth must be
guarded by a demigod too,

246
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,846
and a strong one at that.

247
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:12,102
So, you better be careful
when you challenge the guardian.

248
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,770
We get that,

249
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,856
but wouldn't that make them
kind of like your brethren?

250
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:18,692
Are you okay with that?

251
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,403
I hate those guys.

252
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,363
Since I live like this,

253
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,742
I want to defeat them as Marius,
not as a demigod.

254
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:29,286
I see…

255
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,245
{\an8}Sorry.

256
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,873
{\an8}I had my own motives

257
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:35,083
{\an8}for coming to this labyrinth
with you guys.

258
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:38,753
Well,

259
00:14:38,837 --> 00:14:41,131
I consider you a friend too.

260
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,633
So, I'm counting on you.

261
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:49,681
I have no objections
as long as you don't hurt Lily.

262
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,267
I'll pretend I heard nothing.

263
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,185
Same here.

264
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:56,897
We're friends as long as
you don't hurt Lilia.

265
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,274
I expected that.

266
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:00,984
All right. I'm in too.

267
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:01,985
Me too.

268
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,403
Aren't you glad?

269
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:05,989
{\an8}I owe it all to you.

270
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,407
{\an8}Thanks, Rud.

271
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,576
Um…

272
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:10,493
Lily?

273
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,830
Sorry to ruin the mood,

274
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:15,957
but I'd like to discuss the strategy

275
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:20,545
to deal with the monsters
on the 50th floor.

276
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,506
Of course. I'll leave it to you.

277
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,549
Yes.

278
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,970
First, the lizard.

279
00:15:29,054 --> 00:15:30,472
I think we should play it safe…

280
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,060
<i>We fought off the monsters</i>

281
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:38,021
<i>as they appeared and progressed.</i>

282
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,232
<i>Finally, we reached the 50th floor.</i>

283
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,663
There it is! The Bone Dragon!

284
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:55,789
Let's do this!

285
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,083
Taunt!

286
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,711
<i>Taunt was effective.</i>

287
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,339
<i>We should be able
to proceed according to Lily's plan.</i>

288
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,051
According to the information
about the Bone Dragon,

289
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,261
which appears on the 50th floor,

290
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:13,264
it will frequently
use abnormal status skills.

291
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:17,060
That may disrupt our formation,

292
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,564
so Rud will go in and block it first.

293
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,651
The rest of the party
should stay out of its range.

294
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,194
Understood.

295
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:29,447
Lilia and Marius will attack
from outside its range.

296
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:31,366
It's a bone monster,

297
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:34,661
so it's better to attack it by smashing it
rather than cutting it.

298
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:35,578
Got it.

299
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,496
Mhm.

300
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,791
Also, it's weak to fire.

301
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:44,295
We should enchant our weapons with fire
before attacking it.

302
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,089
We should use mainly fire magic too.

303
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:50,385
In addition, once the Bone Dragon's HP
is reduced to a certain amount,

304
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,344
its body will…

305
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:01,855
Rud!

306
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,859
Thanks, Lily.

307
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:06,776
Don't mention it.

308
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,112
<i>Taking cover under its wing is a no-go.</i>

309
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,449
<i>I'll have to be cautious
before I make my move too.</i>

310
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:17,662
Master!

311
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,956
It's okay, Luna.

312
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,543
He let it hit him
to put distance between them.

313
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,962
<i>It is faster than I expected.</i>

314
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,631
<i>And this puts me too far from my party.</i>

315
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:33,636
Thanks, you two.

316
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,805
No problem.
I've been trying to get pumped up.

317
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:37,432
Good. Let's keep this up.

318
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:38,391
-Yeah!
-All right!

319
00:17:39,934 --> 00:17:42,228
Its attacks are fast and powerful,

320
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,356
but as long as we watch closely
and be careful, we should be fine.

321
00:17:47,442 --> 00:17:48,318
What's going on?

322
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,863
A ranged attack?

323
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,034
Are you guys all right?

324
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:57,452
It was a slight wound,

325
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,288
but I seem to have been poisoned.

326
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,206
Same.

327
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,584
Nin, heal them while I distract it.

328
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,877
Got it.

329
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,587
Luna, heal them with me.

330
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,546
Yes.

331
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:11,966
Take this!

332
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,470
We know you're weak to fire.

333
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,723
Taunt!

334
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,184
What? That thing…

335
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,770
It ignores Taunt
when it is continuously attacked

336
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:25,313
and starts attacking randomly.

337
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,398
Rud, it's coming!

338
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,986
I think my shoulder is dislocating…

339
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,282
<i>My shield feels so heavy.</i>

340
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,159
<i>What's with this stuff?</i>

341
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,286
Someone cast water magic!

342
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,663
It's stuck and I can't--

343
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,084
This stuff is weighing down my shield…

344
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:47,168
Rud!

345
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,464
Thanks for that, Nin.

346
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:55,426
This is turning
into a battle of endurance.

347
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:56,928
In that case…

348
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:00,473
What's that?

349
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,142
An automatic recovery area.

350
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:04,686
It's a saint skill that only Nin can use.

351
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,396
You can treat abrasions there.

352
00:19:08,398 --> 00:19:09,482
All set up.

353
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,109
Make the most of it.

354
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:12,026
Got it.

355
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,612
{\an8}ONE HOUR LATER

356
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,614
{\an8}This thing is still going…

357
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,658
What?

358
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:22,245
This is the thing Lily mentioned…

359
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,000
Its flame is coming!

360
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,459
Everyone, take cover!

361
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:30,211
Rud?

362
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,678
-Rud!
-Master!

363
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,517
Why are you surprised?

364
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:47,729
You think you can burn me
to a crisp with that?

365
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,023
Taunt!

366
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,366
The successive attacks
have depleted 5,000 shield force.

367
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,618
This is not looking good.

368
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,456
You're in it now.

369
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,499
I'll kill you as you wish.

370
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,672
Now!

371
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,342
It's working.

372
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,760
Just a little more!

373
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,137
Taunt!

374
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,556
Thank you, Rud!

375
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,102
<i>This is just…</i>

376
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,271
<i>a stepping stone for us!</i>

377
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:36,945
Life Conversion!

378
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,287
It's the Bone Dragon's drop.

379
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:48,122
Finally, it's over…

380
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,335
Congratulations
on breaking through the 50th floor.

381
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:53,753
Thanks.

382
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,214
But,

383
00:20:56,297 --> 00:21:01,678
I don't think we're in any shape
to continue further.

384
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,595
Yeah.

385
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:04,222
Let's call it a day.

386
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,269
Rud,

387
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:13,273
I think we should hold off
selling the loot we got today for now.

388
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:17,402
Otherwise, news of our raid might get out.

389
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:18,820
You have a point.

390
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,155
Then we'll sell them another time.

391
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,992
Lily, your instructions after returning
are perfect too.

392
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,868
Um…

393
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,123
I'll do my best for the next floor too.

394
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:33,501
Now, as customary, let's celebrate!

395
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,460
Yes!

396
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,963
I'll pass.

397
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:40,091
I'm a little tired.

398
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,801
I want to rest early.

399
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,305
I'll head back too.

400
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,891
See you tomorrow, everyone.
