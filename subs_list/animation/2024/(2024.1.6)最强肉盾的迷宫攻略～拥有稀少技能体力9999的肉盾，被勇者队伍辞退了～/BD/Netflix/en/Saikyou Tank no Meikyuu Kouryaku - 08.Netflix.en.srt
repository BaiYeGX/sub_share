1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:05,005
Great work today, everyone.

2
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,590
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

3
00:00:10,594 --> 00:00:13,556
Alcohol tastes great
after a successful labyrinth raid.

4
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,641
Glad you like it.

5
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:18,227
Is alcohol really that good?

6
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,729
If you're curious,

7
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,689
why not take a sip?

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,528
<i>I've never heard that Homunculi can drink.</i>

9
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,696
<i>Is this okay?</i>

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,533
I really want to try…

11
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,910
All right. Just a little.

12
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,871
Thank you very much.

13
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,502
It's bitter…

14
00:00:46,297 --> 00:00:48,674
It takes a while to get used to the taste.

15
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,010
Why did you make me try it then?

16
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,931
To see your reaction, of course.

17
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,559
It gets better after a few tries.

18
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,395
Enough about that.

19
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,857
You seem to be getting quite close
to Lilia and Lily.

20
00:01:06,275 --> 00:01:08,360
I think we're about the same
as we were before.

21
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,029
Really?

22
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:11,489
What do you think, Luna?

23
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:13,866
Hey. Don't drag Luna into this.

24
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,578
I think you guys are close too.

25
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,789
Did that one sip get her drunk?

26
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:21,457
That's not it.

27
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,209
They're not our clan members,

28
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:25,085
but they helped us a lot too.

29
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,420
So,

30
00:01:26,504 --> 00:01:29,423
I was just worried
that we were causing them trouble.

31
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:32,635
So, it's not a relationship
beyond friendship?

32
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,470
Not at all.

33
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:37,515
Then,

34
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,519
would you consider
that kind of relationship with me?

35
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,023
Are you drunk?

36
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,025
Maybe.

37
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,196
I've told you this before.

38
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,448
It's not something
I'd consider at the moment.

39
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:58,911
Raiding labyrinths is the most
important thing for me at this time.

40
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:00,329
So, I'm not considering

41
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,998
that kind of relationship
with anyone right now.

42
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:06,377
That means we have to hurry up
and settle all the matters.

43
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,003
Which means

44
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:11,215
Master isn't seeing anyone right now?

45
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,217
Yes, that's right.

46
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:17,513
Is something the matter?

47
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,057
Being with Master

48
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,768
always makes me very happy.

49
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:25,312
My heart can't help but feel warm.

50
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,692
So, I want to be with Master forever.

51
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,528
Is… Is that so?

52
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:34,822
Rud, you're rather popular.

53
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,198
Shut up.

54
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,660
Um,

55
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,453
do you want some water?

56
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,498
Luna! Are you okay?

57
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:47,501
-Looks like she's going to be a handful.
-She's completely drunk.

58
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,256
I feel drained…

59
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,929
Huh? What?

60
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,098
Lilia?

61
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:36,110
Lilia?

62
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,364
Rud. Welcome back.

63
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:43,200
Wait, why are you sleeping on my bed?

64
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:49,123
{\an8}<i>I had something I wanted to check on,</i>

65
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,126
{\an8}<i>so I asked Marius to let me come in
and wait for you.</i>

66
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,794
{\an8}Hold the fort until I get back.

67
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:57,006
I guess I was more tired than I thought.

68
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,716
I see.

69
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,884
So, what did you need to talk to me about?

70
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,096
It's about Lily.

71
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,017
She worked really hard today, didn't she?

72
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,643
<i>Yes.</i>

73
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,354
<i>Lily performed better than I expected.</i>

74
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,273
<i>To be honest, she surprised me.</i>

75
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:19,111
<i>She's always been a kid
who can do anything if she keeps cool.</i>

76
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,030
<i>You're twins, after all.</i>

77
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:23,699
<i>It's not like
there's a huge gap in your abilities.</i>

78
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,660
Lily's working really hard.

79
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,620
She's trying to change, little by little.

80
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:32,416
Though maybe she overdid it today.
She collapsed from exhaustion.

81
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,044
What's wrong with you?

82
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:38,630
What do you think about change?

83
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,215
Don't you find it scary?

84
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,926
Well,

85
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,221
I actually don't like change much either.

86
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:47,639
Especially recently,

87
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,892
when Avancia started to change,

88
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,520
<i>I felt like keeping things the same
would be better.</i>

89
00:05:54,313 --> 00:05:57,357
<i>I think many people in town
probably share the same thought as me.</i>

90
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,695
<i>Even now,
I'm not sure if what I'm doing is right.</i>

91
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,655
But sometimes,

92
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,699
I'm glad I embraced change.

93
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,828
<i>We wouldn't see Avancia so lively
and bustling now</i>

94
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,830
<i>if we had stayed the same.</i>

95
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:14,750
That's why I think

96
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,419
it's important to enjoy the change.

97
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,800
I've always thought it's best
to keep things the way they are.

98
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,052
And I still do.

99
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:29,139
<i>Honestly, I'm weaker than Lily.</i>

100
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,600
<i>Of course, I want to support her…</i>

101
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,522
<i>But watching Lily drift away from me
makes me feel a little lonely.</i>

102
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,691
<i>Compared to Lily
who wants to be independent,</i>

103
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:43,529
<i>Lilia, who can't be apart
from her sister, might find it harder.</i>

104
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:45,781
Some things might change,

105
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:47,991
but I think

106
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:50,244
you and Lily will always be the same.

107
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,915
You two will always be close
and love each other.

108
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:57,126
Even if some things change,

109
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,128
the important things won't.

110
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,005
<i>So, even if other things change,</i>

111
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:04,383
<i>you can still get along like you do now.</i>

112
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,513
You're unexpectedly thoughtful.

113
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,016
Well, sorry. I was only saying
what came to mind.

114
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,309
No, that'll do.

115
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,978
That's what I needed to hear.

116
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,814
Lily was shining so brightly today.

117
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:20,482
I couldn't look at her at all.

118
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,276
But…

119
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,028
starting tomorrow, I will be watching her

120
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,572
do her best.

121
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,616
Go for it.

122
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,579
I will.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,334
KEILD LABYRINTH, FIRST FLOOR

124
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:42,212
Let's start from the 51st floor today.

125
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,255
Lily, do the honors.

126
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,298
Got it.

127
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,509
The two major clans
barely made it to the 51st floor.

128
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,094
So we currently have no intel.

129
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,222
However, the fog
inside the labyrinth is thick.

130
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:55,726
We need to use other means to locate
monsters besides detection magic.

131
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:59,396
In that case,
Lily will continue to use detection magic.

132
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,482
Marius and I will also search
for monsters.

133
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,026
Luna, stay on alert at all times.

134
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,194
Uh…

135
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,070
A… About yesterday,

136
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:09,615
I didn't mean anything.

137
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:10,532
Oh, okay.

138
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,994
Seems like Luna's the type
that won't black out even after drinking.

139
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,623
Ready, everyone?

140
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,500
Dungeon Walk.

141
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:24,796
KEILD LABYRINTH, 51ST FLOOR

142
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,425
The fog is really thick here.

143
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:31,512
I don't think we can use
detection magic in this area.

144
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,390
Luna, can you try clearing the fog
with wind magic?

145
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,725
Certainly.

146
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:43,815
It didn't work.

147
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,816
This fog

148
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,735
was created by magic.

149
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,653
What?

150
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,280
That's why it won't disperse
even if you use wind.

151
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,825
However, all monsters have
some magic on them.

152
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,619
Just focus on detecting that energy.

153
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:57,788
I'll try.

154
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,127
{\an8}<i>It's not exact,
but I can vaguely sense it.</i>

155
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,465
<i>It's coming.</i>

156
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:09,508
Everyone, get back.

157
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,509
Something's coming!

158
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,594
Taunt!

159
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:18,642
Water magic?

160
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:22,688
This looks like…

161
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,189
The enemy is likely a Sahuagin!

162
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,649
I'll dispel them.

163
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:33,949
It's too foggy. Our vision is obstructed.

164
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,499
Everyone,
move to the ten o'clock direction.

165
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,209
There are no monsters there.

166
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,503
We're counting on you.

167
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,463
Taunt!

168
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:54,094
Finally coming out of the fog.

169
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,013
Just like Lily said.

170
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,306
It's a Sahuagin.

171
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,026
Even if I can't see with my eyes,
I can find you guys

172
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,861
by detecting your energy.

173
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,112
Nice job, Marius.

174
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,407
<i>After that,</i>

175
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,827
<i>we mastered the detection technique
Marius taught us</i>

176
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,039
<i>and successfully defeated
all the Sahuagin.</i>

177
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,044
Let's take a break
before heading to the next floor.

178
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,421
I'll cook us something.

179
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:30,589
-We'll help.
-We'll help.

180
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,136
You guys are going to eat the Sahuagin?

181
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,095
Yes.

182
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,722
We have to replenish our energy.

183
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,808
Anyway,

184
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,436
the items we got from this drop
are quite something.

185
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,313
Right.

186
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,315
They are all high-quality stuff.

187
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:52,903
I can look at Lily with no problems today.

188
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,363
Thanks to our talk last night.

189
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,074
Thank you.

190
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,120
You two, the food is ready.

191
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,705
Sahuagin tastes great!

192
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:12,214
No fog here, but this place is spacious.

193
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:14,174
Looks like a place where a boss would be.

194
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,592
Enemy approaching.

195
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,137
A magic circle?

196
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,601
It's a Dark Skeleton.

197
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,604
There's something else too.

198
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,110
Something we haven't seen before.

199
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,195
Blue, red, yellow.

200
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,988
They look like crystals.

201
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,366
Sacrificial Shield.

202
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,829
{\an8}<i>Such a powerful aura.</i>

203
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,831
{\an8}<i>It's unlike any opponent</i>

204
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,040
{\an8}<i>we've faced so far.</i>

205
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,668
Lily, please give instructions.

206
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,628
I'll start with physical attacks.

207
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,422
Understood.

208
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,215
Taunt!

209
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,220
What?

210
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,430
It's the crystal.

211
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,099
When Rud attacked,
the yellow crystal unleashed

212
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,309
a protective shield.

213
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,019
{\an8}This is a tricky foe.

214
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,646
{\an8}Should I distance myself for now?

215
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,652
<i>So the red one is offensive.</i>

216
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,782
<i>Then, the blue one is…</i>

217
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,077
<i>Its movements became faster.</i>

218
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,788
<i>I see.</i>

219
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,082
<i>The yellow one acts as a tank,</i>

220
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,419
<i>the blue one enhances abilities,
and the red one is for magical attacks.</i>

221
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:34,754
<i>This is a tricky monster.</i>

222
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,632
{\an8}<i>The yellow defense crystal is
the biggest problem.</i>

223
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,593
{\an8}<i>How should we attack?</i>

224
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,429
<i>For now,</i>

225
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,431
<i>I'll attract its attention</i>

226
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,393
<i>and then attack from behind.</i>

227
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,315
Our attacks were blocked.

228
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:57,486
But it seems it can only deploy
the shield around the crystals.

229
00:13:00,739 --> 00:13:03,283
Great, that'll work.
Continue attacking it like this.

230
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,455
A distraction?

231
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,581
Is everyone all right?

232
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,209
Marius, what's wrong?

233
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,085
I'm fine. It's Lilia…

234
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,218
Something's not right with her.

235
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,891
Lilia, what's wrong?

236
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,851
Don't…

237
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,896
Don't bully Lily!

238
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,732
<i>I must protect her.</i>

239
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,609
Lily!

240
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,071
You've got me into trouble again. Lilia!

241
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,155
<i>I have to protect her.</i>

242
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,491
<i>Don't bully Lily!</i>

243
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:46,701
<i>I will</i>

244
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,161
<i>protect her…</i>

245
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:51,665
I'm your father.

246
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,376
What's with that look?

247
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:55,835
Someone…

248
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,254
You guys are such an eyesore.

249
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,505
Help us…

250
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,388
I won't let you bully Lily anymore!

251
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,558
Nin, heal her.

252
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,559
Hold on.

253
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,645
Lily and Luna are afflicted too.

254
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,314
I have to heal them first.

255
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:17,274
Got it.

256
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:18,608
<i>I see.</i>

257
00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,610
<i>Only Marius, Nin, and I</i>

258
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,571
<i>are immune to abnormal status ailments.</i>

259
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:26,533
<i>If the entire party falls
into abnormal status, we'll be wiped out.</i>

260
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:30,996
Life Conversion!

261
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,959
You sent it flying with the crystals.
Impressive.

262
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,087
Marius, can you hold
the Dark Skeleton back?

263
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,799
Leave it to me.
That thing's a lot easier to deal with.

264
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:43,800
Lilia!

265
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:52,142
I'm sorry, Lilia.

266
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,939
-Let go of me!
-Lilia, you need to calm down.

267
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,191
I won't let you bully Lily anymore!

268
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,152
Don't bully Lily!

269
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,488
You said you were abandoned
by your parents

270
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,407
and have been traveling on your own.

271
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:11,202
Well, rather than say we were abandoned,

272
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:15,081
it would be more accurate to say
we ran away because we were being abused.

273
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,586
<i>Did the abnormal status trigger
her past trauma?</i>

274
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,422
<i>It's possible to calm down someone</i>

275
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:25,133
<i>who's panicking
by reassuring them with words</i>

276
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,676
<i>that can dispel the cause.</i>

277
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,886
Lilia,

278
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,096
no one is going to hurt you here.

279
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,519
Don't worry.

280
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,688
You two are strong now.

281
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,780
Ru… Rud?

282
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:48,698
That's right. It's me, Rud.

283
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,492
Everyone is here.

284
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,411
So calm down.

285
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,668
{\an8}No matter what happens,
I'll do my best to protect you both.

286
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,007
I…

287
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:09,427
The Dark Skeleton's magic must have
thrown you into a state of confusion.

288
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,014
Don't worry.

289
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,433
There's plenty of people

290
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,601
that will help you now.

291
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:21,398
Yeah. You're right.

292
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,942
I have Rud and everyone else.

293
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,153
Marius, thanks for holding it off.

294
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,406
Take a break and get yourself healed.

295
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,116
This is nothing.

296
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,367
But roger that.

297
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,036
We won't be able to seriously damage it

298
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,830
unless we destroy the yellow crystal.

299
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,124
But if we can break it,

300
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,333
we can finish this.

301
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,337
<i>It's trying to trap me.</i>

302
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,547
<i>In that case…</i>

303
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,507
Nin, I need your support.

304
00:16:50,969 --> 00:16:53,888
<i>This will give me some protection
from the fire magic.</i>

305
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:00,478
<i>The crystals switch too quickly!</i>

306
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,980
<i>Is there really no other way?</i>

307
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,110
Lilia, Marius,

308
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,987
I think I found an opening.

309
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,116
The water droplets on my body
went through its protective shield

310
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,743
and landed on the Dark Skeleton.

311
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,536
I'm guessing this thing

312
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,289
can't resist both physical
and magical attacks at once.

313
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,167
It's worth a shot.

314
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,926
The fire magic penetrated
through the shield!

315
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:35,263
This is payback for earlier.

316
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:42,896
It blocked our attacks,

317
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,731
but we managed to damage it.

318
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:45,732
Let's keep this up!

319
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:58,620
It's no use.

320
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,414
You won't get us with that trick again.

321
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,333
Because I've used my magic

322
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,294
to nullify the effects
of all abnormal statuses.

323
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:10,924
Luna's wind magic.

324
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:12,383
Nin's water magic.

325
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,094
Lily's fire magic.

326
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:15,637
It's incredible.

327
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,307
The yellow crystal is glowing!

328
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,434
It's trying to activate
the shield and escape!

329
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,020
Rud?

330
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,189
You'll be damaged by our magic attacks.

331
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,024
{\an8}I'll convert the damage

332
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,735
{\an8}into power using Life Conversion.

333
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,991
Life Conversion!

334
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:42,205
It's been weakened.

335
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,131
It split into two!

336
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,007
Even the crystals duplicated.

337
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,428
Lilia, Marius,

338
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:58,721
take one.

339
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,307
But we don't know which is the real one.

340
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,600
Either will do.

341
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,644
Rud won't be able to hold out much longer.

342
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,481
That's the real one!

343
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,377
Its reaction is completely
different from earlier.

344
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:30,879
In that case…

345
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:34,674
This is the final blow.

346
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,347
Marius, Lilia, take it down!

347
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,909
I thought it was over for us

348
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:02,452
when the boss suddenly spawned.

349
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,413
I need a break.

350
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:06,581
Yeah.

351
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,499
Let's hurry up and find the magic circle

352
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:10,627
and rest before we get to the next floor.

353
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,629
I'll use my detection magic to find it.

354
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,591
It's not foggy here, so it should work.

355
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:19,177
That's strange.

356
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,094
What's wrong?

357
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:21,721
I can't locate the magic circle.

358
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,598
I can't sense it at all.

359
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:27,894
Is this the final floor?

360
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,813
Marius, what do you think?

361
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,106
Hmm…

362
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,779
Honestly, I haven't the faintest clue
what the guardian here is trying to do.

363
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:42,116
Maybe that Dark Skeleton
was their masterpiece

364
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,204
and seeing us defeat it scared them off.

365
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,706
So they sealed off the way
to stop us from advancing?

366
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,749
Yes.

367
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,919
I don't think this is an ordinary guardian
we're dealing with.

368
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,672
So this is as far as we can go?

369
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,591
Still, we've made it far enough.

370
00:20:58,675 --> 00:20:59,884
Let's head back for now.

371
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:04,681
Aw.

372
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,308
Are you already turning back?

373
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:12,188
Who's there?

374
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,987
<i>She's emitting such an intense aura…
Who is this girl?</i>

375
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,655
Rud, this is bad!

376
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,119
Oh, dear.

377
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:30,415
Did I set it so that
Dark Skeletons would continue to spawn?

378
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,709
<i>"Set"?</i>

379
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:35,253
<i>If four of them attack at once…</i>

380
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:38,006
I thought I'd already disabled that.

381
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,219
In one hit…

382
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,013
I didn't expect

383
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,390
a demon-lord-class guardian to appear.
