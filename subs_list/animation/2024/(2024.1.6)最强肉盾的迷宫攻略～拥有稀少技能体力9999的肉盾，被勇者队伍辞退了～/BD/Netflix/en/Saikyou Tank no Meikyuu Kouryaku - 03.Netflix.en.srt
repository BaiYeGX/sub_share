1
00:00:02,044 --> 00:00:03,379
Morning, Manicia.

2
00:00:04,213 --> 00:00:05,464
Big Brother, morning…

3
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:08,718
Good morning.

4
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,553
I'll bring breakfast over right away.

5
00:00:10,636 --> 00:00:12,596
I'll help you…

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,015
I can manage by myself.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,687
Master, Lady Manicia,

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,897
I'm sorry for being late
to prepare breakfast.

9
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,358
You've already prepared.

10
00:00:25,693 --> 00:00:28,070
Looks like you're still not used
to getting up early.

11
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,072
That's quite the bed hair you have there.

12
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,994
I'm so embarrassed by my tardiness.

13
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:38,122
Don't worry about it.

14
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,249
We can help each other.

15
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,208
But…

16
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:44,253
I just can't help but feel
I'm the only one receiving help.

17
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:46,380
That's not true.

18
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:47,882
It is.

19
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:51,552
{\an8}You've not only helped me
lead a regular life

20
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:54,764
{\an8}but also taught me all sorts of things.

21
00:00:56,432 --> 00:01:00,311
Speaking of which,
both of you seem quite knowledgeable.

22
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,064
May I know who taught you all of this?

23
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,734
I see.

24
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,652
"Apprentices"?

25
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,197
I told you we used to live in the slums.

26
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,074
<i>The apprenticeship system,</i>

27
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:16,619
<i>in simple terms,
is a master-apprentice relationship.</i>

28
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,872
<i>Back then,
there was this trend among nobles</i>

29
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,541
<i>to guide children from the slums
onto the right path.</i>

30
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,085
<i>And because of that,</i>

31
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,588
<i> we got the chance to study
at the Knight Academy.</i>

32
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,048
Knight Academy?

33
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,429
He can't pursue his dreams
because of his sister.

34
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,306
I feel so sorry for Rud.

35
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:38,766
Manicia?

36
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,684
Manicia.

37
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,436
Yes?

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,940
I'll be heading to the town in a bit.
Is there anything you need?

39
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:48,359
No… Not really.

40
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,443
I see.

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,793
Rud is incredible!

42
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,045
As expected of Rud.

43
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,838
You'll definitely become a knight!

44
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:34,048
{\an8}<i>My big brother</i>

45
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,301
{\an8}<i>used to come out on top of every exam.
He was an outstanding student.</i>

46
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,555
<i>Everyone thought he was sure
to become a knight.</i>

47
00:03:42,848 --> 00:03:43,682
<i>But…</i>

48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:45,976
Have you heard?

49
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,977
Rumor has it that

50
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:50,898
Rud has decided to become an adventurer
to cure his sister's illness.

51
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,941
No way.

52
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,776
But he has so much potential.

53
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,780
He can't pursue his dreams
because of his sister.

54
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,823
I feel so sorry for Rud.

55
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,077
<i>My existence</i>

56
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,580
<i>made it impossible for him
to choose all the doors open to him.</i>

57
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:14,838
Come in.

58
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,967
Are you not feeling well?

59
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:22,680
No, I'm fine.
I just remembered some things.

60
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,809
Miss Luna?

61
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:31,063
You looked sad, so I thought
this would help you feel better.

62
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:35,567
I'm sorry I don't have
a better way of cheering you up.

63
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,072
Miss Luna, if…

64
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:45,661
If someone was willing
to give up their life for your sake,

65
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,454
what would you do?

66
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,834
<i>That person could've chosen a better path
that could've made them happier.</i>

67
00:04:52,543 --> 00:04:54,295
<i>But he gave them all up</i>

68
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,463
<i>and chose the difficult path
for your sake.</i>

69
00:04:57,381 --> 00:05:01,176
Even though
he could've led a happier life…

70
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:03,762
How would you face

71
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,764
a person like that?

72
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,268
Well,

73
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,980
I don't know if anyone would be
willing to go that far for me.

74
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,773
But,

75
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,484
for that person,
the path he chose is undoubtedly the one

76
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,862
<i>that makes him the happiest, isn't it?</i>

77
00:05:21,572 --> 00:05:24,033
The happiest for that person…

78
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,535
You are talking about Master, are you not?

79
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,495
No, no…

80
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,500
Perhaps you should try
to be honest with him.

81
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:38,172
<i>Master was willing to help
an illegal Homunculus like me.</i>

82
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:42,384
<i>I believe he looks at things differently
than others.</i>

83
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,178
<i>But…</i>

84
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:48,891
<i>I'm not sure how I should face him…</i>

85
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,062
<i>I tell myself
I shouldn't rely on him too much,</i>

86
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,274
<i>so I try to keep my distance
as much as possible.</i>

87
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,652
<i>But the truth is…</i>

88
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,738
I really want to treat him gently.

89
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,449
I'm so conflicted.
I don't know what to do…

90
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:11,914
Why not tell him
all of your feelings, then?

91
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:16,001
{\an8}He… He's back!

92
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,377
{\an8}What… What do I do?

93
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,962
{\an8}What should I tell him?

94
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,047
{\an8}SKILL: MARKER

95
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:25,052
We cannot tell what another is thinking.

96
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,182
So, just try expressing
your thoughts to him.

97
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:32,726
There.

98
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,772
I'm home, girls.
Look at all the magic greens I got--

99
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:37,773
Big Brother,

100
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,651
I have a question for you.

101
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,156
What is it?

102
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,037
<i>I'm scared.</i>

103
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,456
<i>What… What if</i>

104
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,960
<i>Big Brother regrets saving me?</i>

105
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,183
Are you happy with your life right now?

106
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,560
Of course.

107
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,063
<i>How can you say that with such conviction?</i>

108
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:21,984
<i>Even though there were so many other paths
that could make you happier…</i>

109
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,611
Big… Big Brother,

110
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:29,241
why did you come back for me
after I was abandoned?

111
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:31,034
Because…

112
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,955
You saved me back then.

113
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,958
I… did?

114
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,670
Do you remember when I was a kid?

115
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:45,174
I was often called scary
because I was taller than everyone

116
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,051
and had a stern face.

117
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,762
It's Old Man Rud!

118
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,723
He's scary! Let's get out of here!

119
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,059
<i>I just wanted to play with everyone…</i>

120
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,563
Big Brother!

121
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,065
<i>But you,</i>

122
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:05,068
<i>you always stuck by my side
without any fear.</i>

123
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:08,071
<i>Every time that happened,
it made me really happy.</i>

124
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,450
<i>When I decided to live with you,</i>

125
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,368
<i>sure, I had some doubts,</i>

126
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,497
but I've never thought

127
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,749
I made the wrong decision.

128
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,254
Because I really love the time
we spend together.

129
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,173
To me, that's when I'm the happiest.

130
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,179
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:37,059
I assumed how you felt.

132
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:41,438
I thought you weren't happy
because you had to put up with me.

133
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,775
And because of that,

134
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,486
I've been unsure about how to face you.

135
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:48,654
{\an8}Don't say that.

136
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,948
{\an8}I've never been good
at that kind of stuff.

137
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:51,865
I'm sorry.

138
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:54,785
I know.

139
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,205
I know you better than anyone.

140
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,459
That's why I should be more independent.

141
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,171
That's not true at all, Manicia.

142
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,092
Big Brother…

143
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,970
Thank you, Luna.

144
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,556
But I didn't do anything.

145
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:18,600
If it weren't for Miss Luna,

146
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,310
I'd have twisted myself into knots.

147
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:21,770
That's why

148
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,772
I'm really thankful to you.

149
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:29,069
It's… It's almost time for lunch.

150
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,779
I'll prepare the meal.

151
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,448
Let's help too.

152
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,659
Yes, Big Brother.

153
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,163
Who is it?

154
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,749
Who dares disturb
my moment of joy with my sister?

155
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:46,962
Rud, it's been a while.

156
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,922
Nin? Why are you here?

157
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:52,926
I'm here for you, of course.
They finally gave me some time off.

158
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,137
I'm surprised Kygras let you.

159
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,764
It wasn't Kygras.

160
00:09:57,848 --> 00:09:59,391
The church gave me the break.

161
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,103
I'm no longer in the hero's party.

162
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:06,440
After you left,

163
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,318
we haven't been successful
in our labyrinth raids,

164
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:12,154
so the party's been disbanded.

165
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,290
Everyone, battle formation!

166
00:10:27,461 --> 00:10:29,546
Lilia, what have you been doing?

167
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,714
Fight seriously!

168
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:31,632
I am!

169
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:38,597
Drats!

170
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,766
Why can't we damage it?

171
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:43,143
Why are our shields wearing out so fast?

172
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,063
<i>What's different from before?</i>

173
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,440
Sir Kygras!

174
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,360
Another portal opened up.

175
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,236
A new monster is coming.

176
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:59,284
Life Burst!

177
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,788
<i>Activating the skill</i>

178
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,082
<i>cost me 1,000 shield force points.</i>

179
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,377
<i>I never knew it cost so much
to use Life Burst.</i>

180
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,756
<i>Ever since that guy left,
my skill's power has weakened.</i>

181
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,217
<i>My shield force's been depleting
abnormally fast too.</i>

182
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:17,719
<i>Don't tell me…</i>

183
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,974
No. That can't be.

184
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,518
I…

185
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,979
I am never wrong!

186
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,023
I did it!

187
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,360
<i>Just one more…</i>

188
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,863
Um… Sir Kygras?

189
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,323
What?

190
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:42,077
Maybe the difficulty of this level
is more than we can handle.

191
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,370
With all due respect,

192
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:46,706
because we can't defeat all the monsters,
more and more keep showing up…

193
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,749
Shut up.

194
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,835
Nin, hurry up and heal me!

195
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,878
What are you talking about?

196
00:11:51,962 --> 00:11:53,338
I'm not retreating!

197
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,551
{\an8}I can't fail again…

198
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:00,846
Life Burst!

199
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,807
It's not working.

200
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,900
He used up all his shield force.

201
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:14,860
Kygras!

202
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,904
To think it hurts this much

203
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,448
without the shield force…

204
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,169
No!

205
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,639
No… I don't want to die…

206
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:46,766
I can't die…

207
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,188
Get us out of here, Lily!

208
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,355
Okay.

209
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,648
Dungeon Walk!

210
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,410
Curses!

211
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:07,954
Evasion-type tank? What a load of bull!

212
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:11,625
Because of you,
my reputation is in tatters!

213
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,585
We're sorry…

214
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:14,669
We're ashamed.

215
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:16,755
That's not right.

216
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,342
They did nothing wrong.

217
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,594
This time and the previous times,

218
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,597
we failed
because you charged in recklessly.

219
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,515
Huh?

220
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,934
When did you stop training?

221
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,438
You've damaged your body
with all the alcohol you've been drinking.

222
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,151
Even though you've been relying
on Life Burst to make your way so far,

223
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,446
do you really think that's enough
to conquer all labyrinths?

224
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,782
It… It's worked so far, hasn't it?

225
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,408
That's because we had Rud.

226
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,452
Since Rud left,

227
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,247
you finally realized
how your skill works, right?

228
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:52,123
I can tell.

229
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,752
Life Burst strengthens your body,
but at the same time,

230
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,754
it consumes a high amount of shield force.

231
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,633
<i>The day Rud exhausted his shield force,</i>

232
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,636
<i>you unleashed the most powerful
Life Burst you've ever used.</i>

233
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,763
<i>After that day, I realized</i>

234
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,473
<i>Rud's unknown skill allowed him </i>

235
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,309
<i>to bear the damage inflicted
on others' shield forces.</i>

236
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:14,854
<i>So, the cost you paid for using the skill
was transferred to him.</i>

237
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:19,025
After all, you used
Rud's 9,999 resistance skill.

238
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,819
It's no wonder you were so powerful.

239
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,072
No, it was all me.

240
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,157
All I did was kick out a useless tank.

241
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,286
How… How could it turn me into this?

242
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,579
I'm a hero!

243
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:35,083
Enough. I'm leaving the party anyway.

244
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,420
You can continue blaming others
and live an easy life.

245
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,088
I'm leaving too. Sorry.

246
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,091
I'm sorry.
I might have to go train myself more.

247
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,092
Curse you all!

248
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,553
I'll recover in no time
and prove it to you!

249
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,888
I'm the strongest!

250
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,472
I'm the hero!

251
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,142
That's the story.

252
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,185
After that, everyone left the party.

253
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,896
It must've been rough.

254
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,733
I only recently figured out
the effects of my skills.

255
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,276
Sorry for the trouble I caused.

256
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,361
You don't have to apologize.

257
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,947
It's our fault for not noticing too.

258
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,658
Rud, I'm sorry
for everything up until now.

259
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:14,414
We didn't realize
that you were taking on the damage for us.

260
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:16,041
We let ourselves get carried away.

261
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,959
I'm very sorry.

262
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,128
Same here.

263
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:23,340
If only I had figured out
the effects of my skills sooner.

264
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:25,800
So, I'm sorry too.

265
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:27,677
Well, then,

266
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,554
let's put this matter behind us now.

267
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,015
No use dwelling on the past.

268
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:35,560
<i>She's still the same as ever,
always so quick to recover.</i>

269
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,024
You two must be Manicia and Luna.

270
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,651
Hello, Miss Nin.

271
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,361
It's nice to meet you.

272
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,196
I plan to stay here for a while.

273
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,574
Maybe check out the plantations.
I'll be in your care.

274
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,576
Stay here for a while?

275
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,079
What? You want me to leave so soon?

276
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,538
That's not what I meant.

277
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,291
There are no inns in this town.

278
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,753
We get adventurers every now and then,
but they rent vacant rooms too.

279
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:03,755
I see. What should I do, then?

280
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:05,215
In that case,

281
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,050
why not let Miss Nin stay with us?

282
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:08,426
Can I?

283
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,220
If you don't mind staying in my room.

284
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,763
{\an8}No, no, no, Manicia.

285
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:13,223
{\an8}I didn't mention it earlier,

286
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:15,934
{\an8}but Nin is the daughter of a duke.
She's a genuine noble

287
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,811
{\an8}and a saint.

288
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,731
Hey, don't go telling them
unnecessary things.

289
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,149
Manicia, I don't mind at all.

290
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:26,027
<i>If we upset the saint,</i>

291
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,196
<i>we'd be on the church's hit list.</i>

292
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:30,865
Considering all that…

293
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:32,283
you'll be staying in my room.

294
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,577
It's rather dull, isn't it?

295
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,539
But it certainly suits you.

296
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,832
It's reassuring, somehow.

297
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,501
I'll be sleeping in the living room.
Well then…

298
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:45,213
Well, I wouldn't mind
sleeping in the same bed as you, Rud.

299
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,173
Drop the act.

300
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,175
Oh, you saw through that?

301
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,386
Well,

302
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,973
I wasn't entirely joking…

303
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:58,226
Rud!

304
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,436
Rud, are you home?

305
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,480
Fil?

306
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:03,815
Rud!

307
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:04,733
At the orchard!

308
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,153
<i>A monster we've never seen before
has appeared!</i>

309
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,740
The orchard…

310
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,783
Must be that monster's doing.

311
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,702
We have to hurry up and defeat it, or…

312
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,245
Sorry

313
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,955
for dragging you into this, Nin.

314
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,582
Now, you're being a stranger.

315
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,834
We were members
of the same party, weren't we?

316
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:24,169
Found it. It's that thing.

317
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:25,962
Is that a wolf?

318
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:26,880
No. A tiger?

319
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,591
We can't tell
with the magic element around it.

320
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,675
Magic element?

321
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,052
You mean that black miasma?

322
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,304
Yes. I'll purify it.

323
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:40,977
As expected of Nin.

324
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,437
That's nothing.

325
00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:47,942
<i>This monster's biological structure
feels different </i>

326
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:51,154
<i>from all the monsters
I've encountered to date.</i>

327
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,658
<i>It's almost like it's being controlled
by its magic element.</i>

328
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,249
Are you all right?

329
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,085
Rud!

330
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,461
Mister Vild!

331
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:08,463
Father, are you all right?

332
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:09,380
Leader!

333
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:11,633
Sorry, I was in a haste to defeat it.

334
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,676
Watch out!

335
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:15,970
<i>Taunt!</i>

336
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:19,265
Those who can cast magic,

337
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,851
concentrate your healing spells on me!

338
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,269
Understood.

339
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,276
Rud!

340
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,279
Everyone,

341
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:34,739
use this chance to attack it.

342
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,325
{\an8}I'll take on

343
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,744
all the enemy's attacks!

344
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,838
<i>Everyone has taken a lot of damage.</i>

345
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,589
Luna, we're up.

346
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:52,507
Got it.

347
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,180
That's my Nin and Luna.

348
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:00,265
Master!

349
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,975
We'll keep healing you,

350
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,726
so go all out!

351
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,979
Everyone, full attack!

352
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:10,650
{\an8}I have a skill called Sacrificial Shield
that transfers

353
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,652
{\an8}all damage taken by my allies to myself.

354
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:15,697
-With that skill…
-Rud would be the strongest tank there is!

355
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,908
Which means we can go all out
without worrying about its attacks.

356
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:19,826
Exactly.

357
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:20,952
All right.

358
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,453
Let's do this!

359
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,550
It's fleeing.

360
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,636
Don't let it get away! This is bad.

361
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,929
It's headed for the town.

362
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,185
A wall sprung up from the ground?

363
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,269
Luna!

364
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,396
Good.

365
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,944
<i>I'll put all the 20,000 damage
I've taken so far</i>

366
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,530
<i>into this blow.</i>

367
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:00,950
<i>Life Conversion!</i>

368
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,965
<i>I overdid it!</i>

369
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,052
<i>I might have caused more damage</i>

370
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,554
<i>than the monster…</i>

371
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,764
Rud,

372
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:26,893
thanks to you, we were able to defeat
the monster without any injuries.

373
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,061
You have my thanks.

374
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:30,480
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

375
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,452
So it's a C-rank Black Wolf?

376
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,664
But no matter how I think about it,
it had the power of A-rank.

377
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,168
It had two magic stones?

378
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,003
That's unusual.

379
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,465
Monsters that can use magic
typically carry magic stones,

380
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:21,841
but normally, it's only one.

381
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:23,843
Master, these magic stones

382
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,555
look like the ones used
to create Homunculi.

383
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,348
In other words,

384
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:30,808
someone embedded magic stones

385
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,935
meant to create Homunculi
into the monster?

386
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,937
Look at that.

387
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,523
Those are stitch marks.

388
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:43,362
Which means this monster
was artificially created?

389
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:44,489
Yes.

390
00:22:44,572 --> 00:22:48,701
This means someone tried to apply
Homunculi technology to a monster.

391
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:54,123
But isn't it illegal to create
combat-type Homunculi in the first place?

392
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:58,086
Even if it's prohibited, there are always
those curious enough to try it.

393
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,337
That's true.

394
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,506
In the neighboring country,

395
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,300
there's a factory
where all the employees are Homunculi.

396
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,468
<i>But</i>

397
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,095
<i>if they're not just interested,</i>

398
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:09,764
<i>and are creating these things
for some purpose…</i>

399
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:12,183
In any case,

400
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:14,352
let's report this to the lord.

401
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:19,440
<i>Little did we know that the appearance
of this monster carrying two magic stones</i>

402
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:22,276
<i>was merely a prelude
to the events that followed.</i>
