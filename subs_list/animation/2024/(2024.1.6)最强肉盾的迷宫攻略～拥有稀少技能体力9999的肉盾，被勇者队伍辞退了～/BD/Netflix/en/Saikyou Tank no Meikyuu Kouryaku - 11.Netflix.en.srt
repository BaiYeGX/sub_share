1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,296
<i>It's been a few weeks
since the Homunculi settled in Avancia.</i>

2
00:00:04,964 --> 00:00:08,300
<i>The much-anticipated public bathhouse
is slowly taking shape.</i>

3
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,470
<i>Although many residents</i>

4
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,597
<i>worried about Homunculi staying in town,</i>

5
00:00:14,807 --> 00:00:16,726
<i>they showed diligence…</i>

6
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,357
<i>And their efforts</i>

7
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:27,528
<i>have garnered increasing support.</i>

8
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,197
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

9
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:34,785
<i>I've been undergoing mana training
in the Avancia Labyrinth.</i>

10
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:48,716
<i>Demon Lord Greed could come
and claim the life of the strongest, me,</i>

11
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,760
<i>at any moment,</i>

12
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,888
<i>and I must be prepared for it.</i>

13
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:59,393
<i>My senses must be sharpened.</i>

14
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:07,401
What an adorable baby!

15
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,153
{\an8}BAYBERN

16
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,614
A baby wyvern?

17
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:15,534
It would cost 70,000 points
to get this monster in a normal lottery.

18
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,369
You hit the jackpot, Nin!

19
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,747
I got a little fairy.

20
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:22,124
{\an8}LUFIA

21
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,210
Oh, it's a devil fairy.

22
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:26,712
It should come in handy.

23
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,507
Rud,

24
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,009
thanks for letting us use the points.

25
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,887
Thanks to you,
I have a new cute little companion.

26
00:01:35,805 --> 00:01:37,139
Speaking of which,

27
00:01:37,223 --> 00:01:39,642
being the labyrinth manager
is really something.

28
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:41,811
You've gotten so close to the monsters.

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,231
They weren't affectionate with me at all

30
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,066
when I was overseeing the labyrinth.

31
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,318
Well, their love is a little suffocating.

32
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,870
{\an8}OPENING DAY OF THE PUBLIC BATHHOUSE

33
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,204
Today,

34
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,081
the public bathhouse opens its doors.

35
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,542
The Homunculi built this, right?

36
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:30,044
Is it really okay to go inside?

37
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:35,507
<i>Though the reactions
of the residents remain split…</i>

38
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,928
Is that the rumored public bathhouse?

39
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,138
Homunculi are amazing!

40
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,766
We'll be the first group of customers
to try it out.

41
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,893
Please look forward to it.

42
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,520
I'm heading in.

43
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:49,772
Is this really all right?

44
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,943
It's been a long time
since I've been in such a beautiful bath.

45
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:56,403
Demon Lords bathe too?

46
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:57,821
Of course.

47
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,406
What do you take us for?

48
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,785
We are no different
than humans in this regard.

49
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,203
I see.

50
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,746
By the way, where's Luna?

51
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,542
She says she's not used
to showing her body around others.

52
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,460
Is that so?

53
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,797
But perhaps one day she'll come around.

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,007
Let's invite her to join us
when she's ready.

55
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,676
Yes, that's the plan.

56
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,302
All right!

57
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,222
Let's get in and enjoy the bath!

58
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,306
Indeed.

59
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,392
It's quite spacious inside.

60
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:30,729
It's so luxurious that
it makes me feel a little nervous.

61
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,816
Lilia, let's wash each other.

62
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,819
Bubble cat ears!

63
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:39,238
Don't play with bubbles as you wash!

64
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,533
Those two are the same as ever.

65
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,202
All right. Let's do it too, Manicia!

66
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:50,082
I've always wanted
to bathe with a friend too.

67
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:52,001
I see…

68
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,006
Well, if you don't mind…

69
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:57,923
All right!

70
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,008
Wait…

71
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:01,343
I want to join too!

72
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:03,512
Oh, whatever should I do?

73
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,434
The water's quite warm.

74
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:09,893
Don't swim in the bath!

75
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,354
Incidentally, Nin,

76
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,900
you were taught
transformation magic in my class.

77
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:20,237
It's a shame there isn't a mixed bath.

78
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,322
Amon!

79
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:22,990
We agreed to keep that a secret!

80
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:27,703
What kind of transformation magic
do you plan to use in the bath?

81
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,747
Magic to increase the size of one's bosom…

82
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,040
Amon.

83
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,541
Finish that sentence

84
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,419
and I'll add the vegetables you hate
to your meals every day.

85
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,588
What? That would be awful!

86
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,090
Is it because
among the women close to Rud,

87
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,801
I am the most full-bosomed,
so you're jealous of me?

88
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:43,886
What?

89
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:45,888
We heard that.

90
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,973
Allow us to verify.

91
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,309
W… Wait!

92
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,604
Stop this at once!

93
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,525
So soft!

94
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:00,486
Unhand me!

95
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,030
This is to punish you
for saying unnecessary things.

96
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,699
This is something Lilia doesn't have.

97
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,035
Lily! Don't make unnecessary comments!

98
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,789
I was wrong! Please forgive me!

99
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,666
Something the matter, Manicia?

100
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,335
Not at all.

101
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,795
I'm just happy

102
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,715
that I can finally play
with others like this.

103
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,345
Your condition's a lot better now, right?

104
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,262
Yes.

105
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:31,517
Then, you'll have plenty of opportunities
to try all sorts of things in the future.

106
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,102
I hope so.

107
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,187
Please!

108
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,898
It's my one and only request!

109
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,150
It's rather noisy in the men's bath.

110
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,194
We're begging you, Rud!

111
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,029
A little peek wouldn't hurt, right?

112
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,198
I'll just make a small hole in the wall.

113
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,908
Absolutely not!

114
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,409
Manicia's there too!

115
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:52,621
And why are you trying
to peek as well, Marius?

116
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:54,581
I don't care about the view.

117
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:57,209
I just enjoy the thrill of it!

118
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,794
Don't be so blatant!

119
00:06:58,877 --> 00:06:59,795
Please!

120
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,505
I want to see Miss Lily's breasts!

121
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,881
I want to see Manicia's…

122
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,592
Are they trying to peek
into the women's bath?

123
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:06,510
I'll kill them!

124
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,427
Hold on…

125
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,263
Amon, help me hold her back!

126
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,431
Rud!

127
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:11,598
We're all men here.

128
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,559
There's no point in wasting time arguing!

129
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,228
Exactly! Just to add,
I want to see Lady Nin's!

130
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:18,605
I know she's flat,
but I still want to see them!

131
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:24,319
Who said that?

132
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,029
Miss Nin, please calm down.

133
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,031
Enough!

134
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,409
Listen up.

135
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,787
All the girls you've been talking about
are pretty much the same size!

136
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,039
Stick to your fantasies
and behave yourselves!

137
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,674
Rud, how did you find the bath?

138
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,301
It was amazing.

139
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,720
Though, the adventurers
were a lot to handle.

140
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,222
{\an8}Rud.

141
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,434
Anything dangerous inside?

142
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,519
Not at all. It was…

143
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,146
That felt great.

144
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,147
Yes.

145
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,649
The neighboring country's bath
temperature is perfect.

146
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,109
I could get addicted to it.

147
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,778
And the handmade soap is fantastic.

148
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,239
You heard them.

149
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:11,909
Those adventurers looked like
they enjoyed themselves too.

150
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,286
Um…

151
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,124
We await your patronage,

152
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:22,252
so please come and try it someday.

153
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,091
Got it.

154
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,346
Those men seemed
to have good reviews for the bath.

155
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,223
Let's give it a try too.

156
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,517
Is the fragrance on adventurers

157
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,435
from the handmade soap they mentioned?

158
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,230
Mother, let's try it too.

159
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:43,023
The bath is free of charge today.

160
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,358
Please come and try it.

161
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,610
Let's try it too.

162
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,822
Manicia, did you enjoy the bath?

163
00:08:51,406 --> 00:08:53,784
Yes, the bath was enjoyable…

164
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,203
But somehow,

165
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:00,707
it feels like all of us were insulted.

166
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,378
Wow, that was a great bath.

167
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,589
Oh, if it isn't the girls
used in our fantasies?

168
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:09,508
Lily.

169
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,051
On it, Lilia.

170
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,387
-Fusion.
-Fusion.

171
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,228
{\an8}A FEW DAYS LATER

172
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,229
{\an8}Thank you, everyone,

173
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,023
{\an8}for helping build the public bathhouse.

174
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,316
I enjoyed a nice bath.

175
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,359
Thank you very much.

176
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,112
<i>With this public bathhouse,</i>

177
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,031
<i>the folks in town and the Homunculi
have gotten a lot closer.</i>

178
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,701
Please come again.

179
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:37,494
Samimina.

180
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,290
Thank you for reaching out to humans.

181
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:47,212
This is for my own sake.

182
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:49,590
And you have been kind to us.

183
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,216
Even so, thank you.

184
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:52,968
Rud!

185
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,136
What's wrong?

186
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,971
Another fight between the adventurers?

187
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,432
A massive horde of monsters

188
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:00,809
is heading towards Avancia!

189
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,607
I heard there's a large group
of monsters coming towards the town.

190
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,027
The guild seems to have issued
an urgent request to adventurers.

191
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,487
After all, the vigilante corps alone
can't stop them.

192
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:19,202
<i>With so many folks gathered,
we'll overcome this.</i>

193
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,496
Everyone.

194
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:25,709
We're up against over 150 monsters,
but there's no need to fret,

195
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,879
as we are equally matched.

196
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:31,381
Is that right?

197
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:35,719
You are aware we conquered that labyrinth.

198
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,346
Yes.

199
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:42,017
We conquered Keild Labyrinth,
the one the two major clans failed.

200
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,854
Adventurers fortunate enough
to participate in this battle

201
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,939
will receive generous rewards

202
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:50,484
for defeating the monsters.

203
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,072
Now, will you accept our request?

204
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,245
Nice pitch.

205
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:05,123
Reminds me of the ball in Keild.

206
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,292
I did understate the numbers.

207
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,753
There must be about 300 of them.

208
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,798
If it's over 100,
everyone will lose count.

209
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:16,802
And you just have to defeat all of them.

210
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,596
Rud, do you have a moment?

211
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,432
I sense an unpleasant presence.

212
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:25,727
It seems a new labyrinth
has appeared nearby.

213
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:27,270
A new labyrinth?

214
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,774
And it's a formidable one at that.

215
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:35,112
Could those monsters be connected
to the new Labyrinth?

216
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,446
<i>It's a probability.</i>

217
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,031
<i>Though it's just my speculation.</i>

218
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,117
<i>But they must have cloned the monsters</i>

219
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,077
<i>in the labyrinth and sent them out.</i>

220
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,121
Can you do that?

221
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,205
Yes.

222
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,916
So there might be even more monsters
than accounted for.

223
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:49,668
Got it.

224
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,505
You shall have the support of my magic.

225
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,383
I'll be at the frontline
cutting them down too.

226
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,009
You two…

227
00:11:58,093 --> 00:11:59,803
We'll support you too.

228
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:06,268
<i>Rud saved us that day.</i>

229
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,313
Wield me as your sword.

230
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,399
Let us protect this town together.

231
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,986
{\an8}Samimina, everyone…

232
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:19,406
Thank you, for lending us your hand.

233
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,704
Baybern and Lufia!
Do you two want to help too?

234
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,124
I have just the job for you guys.

235
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,091
<i>This should strengthen our defense
as much as possible.</i>

236
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,596
The monsters are in sight!

237
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,389
Raise your weapons!

238
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:48,602
Release your long-range magic and skills
when the monsters are close!

239
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,911
Jeez… that's more than 300 monsters!

240
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,787
This doesn't look good…

241
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:08,788
Don't back down!

242
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:12,000
Look! The group of monsters
at the front are just Goblins.

243
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,585
No need to be afraid.

244
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,338
Attack!

245
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,804
Looks like we took down quite a lot.

246
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,228
What's the deal with those monsters?

247
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,398
Those Goblins can use magic!

248
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,570
This is bad!

249
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,615
Those aren't normal monsters!
We should run…

250
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,200
Ready?

251
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,203
Ready to engage at any time.

252
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,956
Fusion complete. Leave it to us.

253
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,832
All right. Let's do this.

254
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,293
Taunt!

255
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:02,717
He managed to use Taunt
on all the monsters!

256
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,719
Using mana to strengthen the body.

257
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,722
Straight to the center!

258
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,307
Mister Rud is incredible!

259
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,269
Rud, behind you--

260
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:16,815
I'm fine.

261
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,198
I see everything.

262
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,117
Impressive.

263
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,034
That lad

264
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:31,204
used mana to oversee the entire field.

265
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:33,623
Let's continue the attack.

266
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,842
All right. We took care of them all.

267
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,928
This is all thanks to Rud
diverting the attention of the monsters.

268
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:50,056
That guy is really strong.

269
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,142
Your shield force's been fully restored.

270
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,351
Thanks.

271
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:57,105
<i>After they died, they all disappeared,</i>

272
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,481
<i>which means</i>

273
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,901
<i>those monsters really did
come out of a labyrinth.</i>

274
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,194
<i>What in the world is going on?</i>

275
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,280
Here they come again!

276
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,741
Another wave
of different monsters incoming!

277
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,784
We just defeated so many.

278
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,328
And there are more?

279
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,163
There are even Ogres this time!

280
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,915
Remain calm.

281
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,041
B-but…

282
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,167
Don't worry.

283
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:19,169
{\an8}We will be

284
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,670
{\an8}victorious.

285
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,841
Another wave incoming!

286
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,511
Chameleon Kong and Fieldsaurus!

287
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,222
Those are monsters
from Avancia Labyrinth!

288
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,224
Why are the monsters
in the labyrinth here?

289
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,809
I can't fight anymore…

290
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,108
They're attacking the other monsters?

291
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:44,110
What's going on?

292
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,279
Finally!

293
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,158
Duplicate as many of the
Avancia Labyrinth monsters as you can

294
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:51,826
and bring them here to support us.

295
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,373
<i>It seems like things are going smoothly
on Lufia and Baybern's side.</i>

296
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:58,458
Everyone, don't worry.

297
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,878
The monsters from the Avancia Labyrinth
are now under my control.

298
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,922
They are our reinforcements.

299
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:04,923
Reinforcements?

300
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:05,882
Is that for real?

301
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:08,343
I will charge into the enemy
along with the monsters.

302
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,720
Support me as you did earlier.

303
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,265
Taunt!

304
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,111
Mister Rud is surrounded by Ogres!

305
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:27,779
That doesn't look good!

306
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,411
Labyrinth monsters
actually coming to aid humans…

307
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,789
This is unheard of.
I can't believe my eyes!

308
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,670
Mister Rud, you're amazing!

309
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,714
I didn't know you were so strong!

310
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:49,592
No, if it weren't for everyone's help,
I wouldn't have defeated them.

311
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,636
Thank you all for your hard work.

312
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:54,597
I brought some spinach.

313
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:56,725
Come to me if you're injured.

314
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,894
I'll repair everyone's
damaged weapons for free.

315
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:08,111
Thank you for helping protect this town.

316
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,114
That was a magnificent battle.

317
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,198
Amon.

318
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,616
To think you would use

319
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,120
the opponent's trick against them.

320
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,205
I just thought

321
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,082
if the enemy can do it, so can we.

322
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,001
But more than that,

323
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:26,296
the most important thing right now is
to raid the new labyrinth.

324
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,008
Such a dangerous labyrinth
that releases a horde of monsters

325
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,968
must not be overlooked.

326
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,511
Indeed.

327
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,058
If it is him, he'll definitely release
even more monsters next time.

328
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:39,976
Him?

329
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,563
The new labyrinth is most likely

330
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,691
the work of Demon Lord Greed.

331
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:50,028
<i>Demon Lord Greed…</i>

332
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,699
I sense his mana in the area.

333
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,284
Then…

334
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,704
we have to get to Greed's labyrinth
as soon as possible.

335
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:05,585
We must stop him from creating
such disturbances again.

336
00:18:07,504 --> 00:18:08,379
Rud…

337
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:13,218
What do you plan to do
after defeating Greed?

338
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:16,971
Do you intend to extend
an invitation to him as you did with me?

339
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,974
I'm not sure if I should let him join us.

340
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,602
After all, I can't forgive him.

341
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,813
The Homunculi must hate him, too.

342
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:27,023
Are you going to kill him?

343
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,192
Greed is the only one who knows

344
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,985
the situation in Brunn Quelez.

345
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,196
I'd like to capture him alive.

346
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,449
In that case, use these.

347
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,912
These cuffs can seal
the power of a Demon Lord.

348
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:44,415
It's similar
to the slave bracelet I mentioned.

349
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,502
It should be useful
when you raid his labyrinth.

350
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,921
Thank you for all your help.

351
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,131
My pleasure.

352
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,092
I do quite enjoy my life here.

353
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,886
All right. Let's get going.

354
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,304
No.

355
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:03,309
This time, I'll go
with Nin, Luna, Lilia, Lily,

356
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,020
and Samimina.

357
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,524
Samimina will be
a valuable asset to the team.

358
00:19:10,024 --> 00:19:13,278
I want to put her powers to use
in the Greed Labyrinth.

359
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,196
Understood.

360
00:19:15,697 --> 00:19:17,615
What's the meaning of this, Rud?

361
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,033
Why am I being left out?

362
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:19,951
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,246
I want you to stay here
and lead the adventurers.

364
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,915
Amon will be in charge
of the magic support team.

365
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:28,626
No, I want to fight too!

366
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,130
I realized something back then.

367
00:19:32,714 --> 00:19:35,216
<i>Sending out the monsters
was part of Greed's strategy.</i>

368
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:38,386
<i>So even after we go in
to conquer the labyrinth,</i>

369
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,679
<i>he'll send more monsters.</i>

370
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,058
You are closer to the adventurers,

371
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:47,020
and as the subleader of the clan,
you are trusted by everyone.

372
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:51,858
I can only entrust
such a dangerous battlefield to you.

373
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,198
All right. Let's do that then.

374
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,241
Don't worry about things here.

375
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,618
Whatever comes,

376
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,620
I will defeat them all.

377
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,874
Leave the support command to me.

378
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,501
Thank you both.

379
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:15,048
After the battle just now,

380
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,759
we've confirmed
that a new labyrinth has emerged nearby.

381
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:21,304
So, we're going to raid that labyrinth.

382
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,433
If monsters come to attack again,

383
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,770
please protect the town together
with Avancia's monsters.

384
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,737
Um…

385
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,655
Yes?

386
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,906
Is Demon Lord Greed

387
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,409
really in the labyrinth
we're going to raid?

388
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:44,953
I'm afraid so.

389
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,957
You know who Greed is, right?

390
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,042
Of course.

391
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,003
Among the Homunculi, there's no one
who hasn't heard his name.

392
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,422
I see.

393
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,675
Don't force yourself.

394
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,177
Yes.

395
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,018
What's with this labyrinth?

396
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,062
There's nothing here.

397
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,314
I'll search the area with my magic.

398
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,696
There's really nothing here.

399
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,365
Let's move to the next level, then.

400
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:23,908
There doesn't appear

401
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:27,328
to be a magic circle that leads
to the next floor either.

402
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:28,413
What?

403
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,414
That means…

404
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,792
this is the lowest floor of the labyrinth?

405
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:37,714
Such intense mana!

406
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,676
There's no need for such hostility.

407
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,727
My name is Greed.
