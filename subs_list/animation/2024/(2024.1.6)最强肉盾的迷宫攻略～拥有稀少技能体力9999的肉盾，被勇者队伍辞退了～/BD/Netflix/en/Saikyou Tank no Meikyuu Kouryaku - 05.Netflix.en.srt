1
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:10,261
<i>If I can stand in for Master
and protect this town,</i>

2
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:11,971
<i>I'll do it.</i>

3
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:15,349
<i>With the encouragement of my companions,</i>

4
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:19,061
<i>I've decided to save Manicia
and protect this town.</i>

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,856
<i>To realize these objectives,</i>

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,859
<i>I must successfully raid the labyrinth.</i>

7
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,988
<i>Just when I was going to prepare
to establish a clan,</i>

8
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,782
<i>I was summoned by
the investigators of Avancia's labyrinth…</i>

9
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:37,747
<i>only to find out that those investigators
were members of my former party.</i>

10
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,672
So, let me reintroduce myself.

11
00:00:48,048 --> 00:00:49,467
I'm Lilia.

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:52,428
I believe this is the first time
we've met since you were fired.

13
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,472
I'm the younger of the twins, Lily.

14
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:57,558
Although we're twins,
our eye colors are different

15
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,060
due to our unique constitution.

16
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:00,227
<i>They're really close.</i>

17
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,439
Thank you for all your hard work.

18
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:06,776
I'm Shugor, the knight of the church.

19
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,070
I… I am Luna.

20
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:10,738
It's nice to meet you.

21
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:15,993
Well, let's discuss the details inside.

22
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,705
Yo.

23
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,666
Long time no see, Rud.

24
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,376
Kygras!

25
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:26,837
How dare you summon us!

26
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,964
<i>After everything you did to Rud!</i>

27
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,468
Thank you,

28
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,053
but I've put that behind me.

29
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,430
Kygras,

30
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,057
tell me why we're here.

31
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,352
I'm sure you didn't call us here
just to say hello.

32
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,481
Yesterday,

33
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:49,568
we encountered a sentient guardian
during our investigation.

34
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:51,779
<i>A sentient guardian?</i>

35
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,866
<i>Of all the labyrinth guardians
we've fought up until now,</i>

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,952
<i>even if capable of taking on human forms,</i>

37
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,829
<i>were incapable of speech.</i>

38
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,417
You've seen what a miserable state I'm in,

39
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:06,377
so…

40
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:09,463
you go in and investigate for me.

41
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,717
I'm just trying to finish the quest
while slacking off.

42
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,177
Don't complain. Just do it.

43
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:16,887
In short,

44
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:19,181
having you investigate
the labyrinth in his place

45
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,891
is this guy's way of apologizing.

46
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,351
Don't say that!

47
00:02:22,434 --> 00:02:23,853
What, are you shy?

48
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:24,812
I'm not!

49
00:02:25,563 --> 00:02:26,522
Ugh, seriously.

50
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,692
To cure your sister,

51
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,861
don't you need the labyrinth's treasure?

52
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:33,070
You remember that?

53
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:36,699
I… know the reason

54
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,077
<i>I've been able to successfully raid</i>

55
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:43,122
the labyrinths up until now.

56
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,417
So, what's your decision?

57
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,545
Are you going to do it or not?

58
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:52,298
Please let me do it.

59
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:02,641
In that case,
I'll be borrowing Lilia and the others.

60
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,351
Rud,

61
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,563
I'm sorry about everything.

62
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,567
Don't die.

63
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,278
Thanks.

64
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,865
I will defeat the guardian.

65
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,377
I didn't expect Kygras to say all of that.

66
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,005
But it's great to have a full party.

67
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:56,922
Yes.

68
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,842
Let's raid Avancia's labyrinth.

69
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,274
This is…

70
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,193
We'll be teleporting
to the first floor from here.

71
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,571
Let's go.

72
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:34,460
I had no idea it would be so spacious
inside the labyrinth.

73
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,337
You can even see the sun.

74
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:40,090
Just a reminder, that sun won't move.

75
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,509
Be careful not to let it
distort your sense of time.

76
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,055
As the space inside is warped,

77
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,807
many things that are impossible
in reality can happen here.

78
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,978
The magic circle disappeared.

79
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,647
Doesn't that mean we can't go back?

80
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:56,690
That's right.

81
00:05:56,774 --> 00:06:00,360
If we want to go back,
we'll have to find another magic circle.

82
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,362
But don't worry about it.

83
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,949
Lily has a skill called Dungeon Walk.

84
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:07,576
Normally,

85
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,286
to move between floors,

86
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:13,290
you have to locate
the randomly configured magic circles.

87
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,667
However, with Dungeon Walk,

88
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:18,295
you can move freely
between floors you've been to.

89
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,671
DUNGEON WALK

90
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,759
But the skill only allows
for a maximum of six.

91
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,386
So, only six people
can be teleported at the same time.

92
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,348
There are other spells
similar to Dungeon Walk.

93
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,849
Nin, show it to Luna.

94
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,434
Got it.

95
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,064
This is an emergency escape spell.

96
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,148
Let me try it.

97
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,238
She learned it in an instant.

98
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,239
Impressive.

99
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:49,243
<i>That was most likely the ability</i>

100
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,787
<i>of a combat-type Homunculus.</i>

101
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:56,750
Three Chameleon Kongs approaching.

102
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,922
Lilia and Shugor, take the front.

103
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,509
Nin and Lily will be in the rearguard.
Handle support and healing.

104
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,137
Luna will move around
and protect the party.

105
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:10,597
And I, as always,

106
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,182
{\an8}will be the tank.

107
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:15,102
Taunt!

108
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:38,959
{\an8}Let's defeat them with this momentum!

109
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:39,877
{\an8}-All right!
-All right!

110
00:07:44,465 --> 00:07:46,049
This party is good.

111
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,643
This is where
the guardian appeared last time.

112
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,479
Not this time, though.

113
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:01,857
Fieldsauruses!

114
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,777
<i>They are faster
than the ones in other labyrinths.</i>

115
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,654
<i>Is this the work of the guardian here?</i>

116
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:10,741
{\an8}I'll handle these guys.

117
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,869
You guys find the magic circle.

118
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,329
Got it.

119
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:16,663
Taunt!

120
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,047
Remember to conserve strength
for the guardian battle.

121
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,053
Found the magic circle.

122
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,055
Great. Let's progress.

123
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,266
Good judgment.

124
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,562
Seventh floor.

125
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,273
Eighth floor.

126
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,859
Ninth floor.

127
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:50,072
Hurry up and come to me.

128
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:55,244
The next floor is finally the tenth floor.

129
00:08:58,872 --> 00:08:59,706
Everyone,

130
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,670
thank you for going along
with my selfish request.

131
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,672
What's with it all of a sudden?

132
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,174
No need to be so polite.

133
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,969
It's for your sister, right?

134
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:15,013
I understand how important
your family is to you.

135
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:16,348
We do.

136
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,683
That's right…

137
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:20,269
It's too soon to say "thank you."

138
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,356
Rud.

139
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,070
This is where the challenge begins.

140
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,366
Right.

141
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,960
Let's defeat the guardian together.

142
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:51,758
It's a sea of grass.

143
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,971
That was

144
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,764
a splendid performance.

145
00:09:58,515 --> 00:09:59,683
<i>This guy is…</i>

146
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,771
I never expected
such powerful adventurers.

147
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,274
{\an8}<i>…the sentient guardian.</i>

148
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,359
Welcome

149
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,236
to my labyrinth.

150
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,534
I am the guardian of this labyrinth…

151
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,954
Marius.

152
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,962
I heard the guardian was
on the fifth floor.

153
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:33,759
{\an8}Well, considering my formidable opponents,
I figured I should wait for you

154
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,595
{\an8}on the tenth floor,
where I can unleash my abilities.

155
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,266
This floor is my domain.

156
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,684
Anyway,

157
00:10:42,768 --> 00:10:44,853
you'll soon find out

158
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,271
what I'm capable of.

159
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:55,155
What's with this power?
My arm feels like it's about to break.

160
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,783
It's impressive
that you could block that attack.

161
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,368
It seems waiting was worthwhile.

162
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:00,869
Marius,

163
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,246
I didn't come here to fight you.

164
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,206
Let's talk…

165
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:06,708
Exchanging blows with blades is

166
00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:11,254
the way men converse.

167
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,716
<i>He'll get us the second we drop our guard.</i>

168
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,676
Leave the negotiations for later.

169
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,969
Prepare for battle!

170
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,513
Here we go!

171
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:21,973
{\an8}<i>Not bad.</i>

172
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:31,983
What's with him?

173
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,652
Does he have eyes on his back?

174
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,029
Excellent teamwork.

175
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,950
Looks like I'll have to get serious.

176
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,995
Once I reveal my true abilities,
I'll turn into a complete monster.

177
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,416
If you don't want to die,
use your skills to escape.

178
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,002
Let's see if you can defeat me.

179
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:01,555
What's this guy's deal?

180
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:05,517
<i>You can tell how dangerous he is
just by the sound of his roar.</i>

181
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,852
<i>But,</i>

182
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,563
<i>I can't back down.</i>

183
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,275
<i>I'll just have to defeat him.</i>

184
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,945
{\an8}Such a heavy blow.

185
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:24,578
Lilia, get on my wind.

186
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,579
All right.

187
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,462
Mister Rud, let's take turns
drawing the enemy's attention.

188
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,504
I'm counting on you.

189
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,381
Magic. Taunt.

190
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:44,473
<i>He is insanely powerful.</i>

191
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,684
<i>One more blow like this</i>

192
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,728
<i>could be fatal.</i>

193
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,355
Don't take his attacks head-on.

194
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,275
That's something
only you can do, Mister Rud.

195
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,487
Nin, focus on healing.

196
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,948
Lily, use support magic
to maintain the vanguard's strength.

197
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,283
Luna, cover us.

198
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,242
Understood.

199
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:05,869
Shugor,

200
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:06,786
let me take over.

201
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,455
{\an8}Taunt!

202
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,543
<i>It's going to be a long fight.</i>

203
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:16,463
Then it's a battle of stamina.

204
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:17,672
Is that okay?

205
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,383
It might not be favorable
for a typical party,

206
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,928
but we have Rud.

207
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:24,846
With Sacrificial Shield,

208
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,265
we can channel all the damage
we received onto Rud.

209
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,185
The shield force worn down
in the prolonged battle

210
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,480
can unleash tremendous power
through Life Conversion.

211
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,067
We pin our hopes on that one strike

212
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,194
and get through the battle of endurance.

213
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:48,161
Lady Lilia!

214
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,996
At this rate,

215
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,873
someone will go down.

216
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:52,791
Luna.

217
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,753
As the rearguard,
it's hard to watch your comrades suffer.

218
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,674
But so long as we still stand,
so will our vanguard.

219
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:02,759
So, remember this.

220
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:07,055
We must hold our ground and stand firm.

221
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,435
I understand.

222
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,401
<i>He is slowing down.</i>

223
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,735
<i>Is he getting tired?</i>

224
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,323
<i>We've currently used up
30,000 shield force points.</i>

225
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,285
<i>If I hit him with that…</i>

226
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,998
Master!

227
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:34,749
Luna!

228
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,670
<i>I can't let this opportunity slip away.
Let's finish this battle!</i>

229
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,171
Life Conversion!

230
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,389
Did we get him?

231
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,645
No way! He's still moving!

232
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,774
<i>The attack was effective.</i>

233
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,694
<i>If we can use Life Conversion again…</i>

234
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:24,049
Is everyone all right?

235
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,383
I'm fine.

236
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:27,010
Lily!

237
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,554
Are you all right?

238
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,724
I just need a moment…

239
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,898
Shugor!

240
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,359
I… I'm fine.

241
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,446
I can still fight.

242
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:56,748
<i>Do I really want to endanger everyone
for my own selfish desires?</i>

243
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,543
<i>I don't want everyone</i>

244
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,254
<i>to risk</i>

245
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,256
<i>their lives for me.</i>

246
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,219
Emergency retreat.

247
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,971
Prepare to leave.

248
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,430
What are you saying?

249
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,474
I am the leader of this party.

250
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:16,935
I must make the right decision.

251
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:20,939
Rud.

252
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:24,150
We've all come this far.
Are you going to give up on your dreams?

253
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,610
Nin…

254
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:28,947
Didn't I tell you to do what you want,
and stop holding back?

255
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,533
Mister Rud, please don't underestimate me.

256
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:35,120
Did you want to retreat
because you saw me struggle just now?

257
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,746
I came here prepared to fight,

258
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,457
even if it meant risking my life.

259
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,001
Rud!

260
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,086
Things like running away…

261
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:47,424
Don't give me such a lame speech!

262
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:51,511
I…

263
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,351
I want to save Manicia.

264
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,103
So… please,

265
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,312
lend me your strength!

266
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,440
-Skill. Fusion.
-Skill. Fusion.

267
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,450
Fusion complete. Lilialy.

268
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:15,827
Lilialy.

269
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,620
Leave it to us.

270
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,710
<i>Lilialy…</i>

271
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,171
<i>Shugor…</i>

272
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,965
<i>Luna… Nin…</i>

273
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,051
<i>This time…</i>

274
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,721
Shugor's shield force broke!

275
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:37,223
Life Conversion!

276
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,647
<i>If I take this blow,</i>

277
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,983
<i>my shield force will run out, too.</i>

278
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,486
<i>But I will take it.</i>

279
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,654
<i>I'll turn every last damage</i>

280
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,698
<i>into power!</i>

281
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,867
-Get him!
-Get him!

282
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,164
Life Conversion!

283
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,147
I had fun, Rud.

284
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:32,320
I'm so tired I can't even move a finger.
Now, you can do whatever you want with me.

285
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:36,074
Is this the end?

286
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,450
Yes.

287
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:39,786
But,

288
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:42,580
it won't be over
until you give me a final blow.

289
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,791
Didn't I say at the beginning?

290
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,668
I came here to negotiate with you.

291
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:49,003
Marius,

292
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:54,050
do you have the labyrinth treasure
that can grant any wish?

293
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,886
What? Do you want this?

294
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,221
Take it.

295
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,182
This is a magic stone
that can perform miracles.

296
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:04,269
Just hold the magic stone,
imbue it with magic, and make a wish.

297
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:06,980
But it's only good for one wish.

298
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,148
So, use it wisely.

299
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,733
Is that all?

300
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:11,860
Give me the final blow.

301
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:15,488
No, I want to avoid
the labyrinth disappearing

302
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,157
because there's a town nearby.

303
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:18,867
That's why,

304
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,163
Marius, I want you to continue to be

305
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,874
the guardian of the labyrinth
and oversee this place.

306
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:29,878
In other words,

307
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:32,005
you want to cooperate with me?

308
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,966
I enjoy battling powerful individuals,

309
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:36,718
so…

310
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,761
I'll gladly help.

311
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,598
And I hope to battle you again someday.

312
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:45,935
About that… Maybe cut me some slack.

313
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,777
Big Brother! You're battered
and bruised all over.

314
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,196
I'm fine.

315
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,615
Anyway, this is for you.

316
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,241
Please accept it.

317
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,118
This is…

318
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,871
It's the magic stone
I've been searching for.

319
00:20:05,997 --> 00:20:07,207
I can't accept it.

320
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,667
You should use it for yourself.

321
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,962
{\an8}Even if I use it,
the result will be the same.

322
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:16,966
So…

323
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,593
Please use it.

324
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,014
Big Brother…

325
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,768
I understand.

326
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,940
O' magic stone that grants miracles,

327
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,027
please fulfill this long-standing wish

328
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,363
of mine…

329
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,788
Any changes?

330
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,374
Manicia?

331
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,252
Though it's just a bit,
I don't feel as exhausted as before.

332
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,796
Before, if I moved like this,

333
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,673
I'd be out of breath in no time.

334
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,759
<i>Now,</i>

335
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,970
<i>it feels like I can keep spinning forever.</i>

336
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,977
<i>It's the first time
I've seen Manicia like this.</i>

337
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,230
<i>So long as I keep adventuring,</i>

338
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,649
<i>one day, she will be completely cured.</i>

339
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:16,442
Big Brother…

340
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:18,778
<i>I've always worried</i>

341
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,447
<i>that Manicia might suddenly
leave me one day.</i>

342
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,034
<i>But it's going to be all right now…</i>

343
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,453
<i>Every effort I've made was</i>

344
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,747
<i>not in vain.</i>

345
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,294
Thank you,

346
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,254
Big Brother.

347
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,391
Rud!

348
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:13,976
Marius?

349
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,353
What brings you here?

350
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:16,521
Congratulations.

351
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:20,274
Starting today,
you're the guardian of the labyrinth.

352
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:22,193
What?
