1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:02,712
I'll wipe out all the Fieldsauruses!

2
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:06,007
<i>The town has undergone tremendous changes.</i>

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,091
…are mine!

4
00:00:08,676 --> 00:00:11,053
I have to deal with the disputes again.

5
00:00:11,137 --> 00:00:13,097
Yo, Rud.

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,016
That's a troubled face you have there.

7
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,517
Bu. Gali.

8
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,105
You just became the leader of a clan.
This is a bit much on your shoulders, huh?

9
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:24,817
Maybe you should
let someone else handle things?

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,902
Yes, about that,

11
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:29,113
I have a favor to ask of you.

12
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:32,116
Welcome back.

13
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,118
Oh. Another dispute?

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,036
Yes.

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,664
Well, Fieldsauruses are perfect
for making potions and weapons,

16
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,002
so it's no surprise
everyone's keen to take them down.

17
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,004
I guess you do need some help

18
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,507
to run a clan.

19
00:00:48,591 --> 00:00:49,467
Yes.

20
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:52,303
Manicia's handling the day-to-day stuff,

21
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,430
but we can't let her be too overworked.

22
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,391
I asked Lilia, but…

23
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,353
Sorry. My information bank isn't enough
to guide you through this.

24
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,315
Maybe you should ask the other clans.

25
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,400
The other clans, huh?

26
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:08,235
Though, the ideal situation would be

27
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,613
to form an alliance with other clans.

28
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,491
That way, you'll be on equal standing.

29
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,117
If you end up under another clan,

30
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:18,454
it'd defeat the purpose
of establishing a new clan.

31
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:20,498
<i>But if you want allies,</i>

32
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,959
{\an8}<i>it might be challenging if you don't have
something to bring to the table.</i>

33
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,169
{\an8}<i>True.</i>

34
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,213
Our clan only has Nin, Luna,

35
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,256
Manicia, and me, after all.

36
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:33,886
If only you had something
you could show them right away.

37
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,014
Lily.

38
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:41,602
Something we can
show the others right now, huh?

39
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,021
Only our combat strength, I think.

40
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:45,940
However,

41
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:52,196
to protect Marius, I only told them
that we've repelled the guardian.

42
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,364
You have a point.

43
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:54,824
Seems like

44
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:58,410
we really need someone to guide us
on how to manage a clan.

45
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:00,996
After asking Lilia,

46
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,706
I've been putting in the effort.

47
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:08,629
You truly live up to being a clan leader.
How dependable.

48
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:09,797
At this rate,

49
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,424
we might just end up
becoming a large clan soon.

50
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,635
You don't sound too happy about that.

51
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,179
Well, if that happens,

52
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:23,060
we won't get to spend as much time
alone together anymore.

53
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:34,780
Rud.

54
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:40,661
If you can't find any allies or helpers,

55
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,623
you can use my identity for publicity.

56
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:46,834
I can't do that.

57
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:47,793
You dislike that.

58
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,422
Rud, you really are…

59
00:02:52,715 --> 00:02:55,843
Rud, become the manager of the labyrinth!

60
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,720
What are you doing?

61
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:58,679
Nothing.

62
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:01,432
Didn't I already refuse?

63
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:03,100
I'm quite busy now.

64
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,770
Then I'll join your clan
and help you stop the fights.

65
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,731
That's not all you do in a clan.

66
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:12,192
By the way, is it okay for the guardian
to be wandering around like this?

67
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,235
Not a problem at all.

68
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,238
Then, do you harbor any…

69
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,698
resentment towards humans?

70
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,327
Are you really asking that?

71
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,411
So, he does.

72
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:24,038
Looks like he has a story to tell.

73
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,373
Not even the slightest.

74
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,417
So, let me help you.

75
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,628
And, in turn,
you help me manage the labyrinth.

76
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:33,130
Fine.

77
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,716
I'll let you join the clan.

78
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,094
Explain the labyrinth management.

79
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:41,305
Let's get going then.

80
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,478
I haven't agreed
to become the manager, though.

81
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:31,582
Rud, come.

82
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,836
Do you manage the labyrinth from here?

83
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,795
That's right.

84
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:40,758
This pond projects
the conditions of the labyrinth.

85
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,262
You adjust the monster configuration
and labyrinth structure here.

86
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,016
See the points?

87
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,934
You can create or replicate monsters

88
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:54,021
just by using points.

89
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,690
Do these points automatically increase?

90
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,694
Points increase over time

91
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:03,113
or by depleting
an adventurer's shield force.

92
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:05,365
I see.

93
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,202
So, for example, if you deplete
an amount of my shield force,

94
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:10,245
you get an equivalent amount of points?

95
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:12,122
Oh, you can do that?

96
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,333
Can you demonstrate it to me?

97
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,334
Sure.

98
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,795
Are you cloning a Goblin?

99
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,297
I'm summoning it into the labyrinth.

100
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,054
-Hey, that will scare off the adventurers.
-Ow…

101
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:30,599
Can you clone other monsters
besides Goblins?

102
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:32,184
Yes.

103
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,394
The only ones we can currently clone are…

104
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,438
<i>Goblins, Axe Orcs,</i>

105
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,023
<i>Chameleon Kongs,</i>

106
00:06:38,107 --> 00:06:40,567
<i>and Fieldsauruses.</i>

107
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:45,823
Only monsters created
through Creation can be cloned.

108
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,535
By the way, if you can establish
a trust relationship with monsters,

109
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:52,162
they might help you in dire situations

110
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,414
and even become quite fond of you.

111
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:56,583
Will monsters really bond with humans?

112
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:01,505
It costs a million points?
It's impossible to create new monsters.

113
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:02,422
That's right.

114
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,967
That's where the grimoire comes in.

115
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:08,846
It's an item that can let you
randomly create monsters.

116
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,180
It's like a lottery.

117
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,807
Want to try it?

118
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,983
{\an8}Slime?

119
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:26,655
It's a little different from what I said,
but it grew attached to you.

120
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,617
Does this mean we can create Slimes now?

121
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,618
Correct.

122
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:32,703
That means

123
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,996
with time,

124
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,207
we may be able to create S-rank monsters.

125
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,711
<i>Adventurers to Avancia</i>

126
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,421
<i>mostly come for the Fieldsauruses.</i>

127
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,800
<i>While they're popular now,
the flow of people will likely decrease</i>

128
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,052
<i>once their drop is
readily available everywhere.</i>

129
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:50,721
<i>This way,</i>

130
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,223
<i>I can add various types of monsters
into the labyrinth</i>

131
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:56,268
<i>to stabilize the flow of adventurers.</i>

132
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:58,604
<i>This…</i>

133
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,689
<i>would help the clan management too.</i>

134
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,780
The hit just now recovered 1,000 points.

135
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,825
Hey, Rud!
I think that little guy's a Rare Slime!

136
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,703
Creating such a powerful creature.
You really struck gold!

137
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,831
Thank you, Slime.

138
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,083
Thanks to you, I've got a great idea.

139
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,627
Marius,

140
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:26,048
I'll manage the labyrinth in your stead.

141
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,424
Really?

142
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:32,304
Not right away. But I'll think about
what kind of labyrinth I want to create

143
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:33,680
to attract adventurers.

144
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,726
Can I trouble you to manage it
for a while longer?

145
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,394
I'll accept that.

146
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,648
What should we do about this little guy?

147
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,942
It doesn't like me at all.

148
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,401
You should take it with you.

149
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,198
Slime?

150
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,116
It's okay, Luna.

151
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,911
Well, um, I ended up
with this little thing somehow.

152
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,581
And Manicia's always wanted a pet…

153
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:06,713
It looks cuter
than the other Slimes out there.

154
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,216
Aw, so cute.

155
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,218
Big Brother,

156
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,136
if we're keeping it,

157
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,514
we should give it a name.

158
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:16,723
You're right.

159
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,433
Master,

160
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,436
you came up with my name
almost immediately.

161
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,313
You didn't…

162
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,399
just pick a name, did you?

163
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:27,818
No, I didn't!

164
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,112
I thought it over
and came up with a cute name.

165
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:34,533
I think you said it was because
Lunafia petals fell on Miss Luna.

166
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,702
That was surprisingly spontaneous of you.

167
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:39,121
R… Right.

168
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:40,414
How about Lime?

169
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,166
I think it likes it.

170
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,002
That's great.

171
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,795
Nice to meet you, Lime.

172
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:51,717
I love seeing you flustered.

173
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,051
Me too.

174
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,886
Give me a break…

175
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,604
Avancia's clan leader?

176
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,773
An alliance with a clan
from such a rural town?

177
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:09,276
Bu, reject them.

178
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:10,944
No, wait.

179
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,699
This kid seems interesting.

180
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,409
{\an8}Very well.

181
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,953
{\an8}The two major clans
will be holding a ball.

182
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:22,497
-Invite them.
-Invite them to join us.

183
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,919
<i>Days later,</i>

184
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,797
<i>we found ourselves in Keild.</i>

185
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:33,216
This town's bigger than I imagined.

186
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:35,510
Lilia, Lily,

187
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,928
thank you for coming along.

188
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,096
Don't mention it.

189
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,349
We can stop by the guild here too.

190
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,018
It's my first time attending a ball.

191
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,895
How exciting, Lilia.

192
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,024
Rud, what do those flags represent?

193
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,151
Just like the ones printed here,

194
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,112
those are the flags of
Black Dragon Fang and White Tiger Claw.

195
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,449
Those flags are everywhere.

196
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,412
Everyone's here, yes?

197
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,122
Take a look at these.

198
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:07,459
They're the invitations to a ball

199
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,962
from the two major clans of Keild,
Black Dragon Fang and White Tiger Claw.

200
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:13,090
Isn't it great, Big Brother?

201
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,633
Though I'm not entirely clear,

202
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,801
Master is formidable.

203
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,135
{\an8}Look.

204
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:21,223
{\an8}I doubt they're interested
in being chummy.

205
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,308
{\an8}What conditions did they propose?

206
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:25,811
{\an8}You're right.

207
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,729
{\an8}They rejected the alliance proposal.

208
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,774
{\an8}They'd consider letting us
become their subsidiary.

209
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,234
I knew it.

210
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,778
That's not all.

211
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,781
In return for their help,

212
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:39,908
they want Nin.

213
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:40,909
Nin?

214
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,412
Nin is a renowned saint.

215
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,873
It's not just the two clans.
I've talked to others.

216
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,585
But most of them are interested in Nin.

217
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:52,796
I'm in high demand, after all.

218
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,757
So, what are you going to do?

219
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,218
Are you going to hand me over?

220
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,596
If you want to go, I won't stop you.

221
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,182
What if I ask you not to give me up,
no matter what?

222
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,143
Then I'll turn them down.

223
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,107
Then reject them.

224
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,318
I don't plan on affiliating myself
with any other clan.

225
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:17,696
I understand.

226
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,531
I'll turn them down no matter what.

227
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,912
But I am prepared to attend the ball,

228
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,372
knowing the lurking dangers.

229
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,417
The guests will likely belong

230
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,752
to either Black Dragon Fang
or White Tiger Claw.

231
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:35,630
I cannot pass up this opportunity

232
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:39,384
to speak directly to the leaders
of the two major clans.

233
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:40,635
You're right.

234
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,512
Now is not the time to retreat.

235
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,349
Keild…

236
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:47,517
What's wrong?

237
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,562
Nothing,
just remembered something unimportant.

238
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:52,647
<i>I once saw a labyrinth</i>

239
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:55,609
<i>with a sentient guardian just like me
in that pond.</i>

240
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,528
{\an8}And the labyrinth's name is the same
as the town called Keild,

241
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,071
{\an8}Keild Labyrinth.

242
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,242
{\an8}That's important information!

243
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:05,494
{\an8}Is that so?

244
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:07,329
<i>In other words,</i>

245
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,122
<i>if we can conquer Keild Labyrinth</i>

246
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,291
<i>and obtain another magic stone,</i>

247
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,462
<i>perhaps Manicia's illness
can be completely cured.</i>

248
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,214
Keild Labyrinth.

249
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:19,508
I heard that the two major clans

250
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,886
only ever managed
to break through to the 50th floor.

251
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,847
But we've grown a lot during this time.

252
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,226
<i>Marius with impeccable firepower,</i>

253
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,687
<i>Luna, who practices magic
whenever she has free time,</i>

254
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,272
<i>and the excellent healer Nin.</i>

255
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,108
We should be able to form a great party.

256
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:39,653
Raid the labyrinth and find an alliance.

257
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,864
It looks like we're going to have
a very interesting trip.

258
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,117
<i>I'm sure neither will be easy to achieve.</i>

259
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,329
<i>But I must form an alliance with them</i>

260
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,498
<i>and obtain the labyrinth treasure.</i>

261
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,339
Sorry to keep you waiting.

262
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,008
Well? Doesn't it suit me?

263
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,095
It does.

264
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,556
I did try to get Luna
to wear a dress like me.

265
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,018
I… I think I look better in this.

266
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,940
You'd look beautiful in a dress, too,

267
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,984
but the maid outfit suits you.

268
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,611
Thank… Thank you.…

269
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,657
Lilia, you need to walk
with your head held high.

270
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:30,120
These girly clothes are really not for me.

271
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,581
Don't worry, you look adorable.

272
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,421
Don't keep staring at me.

273
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:40,422
Lilia is shy.

274
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,756
Stop that.

275
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,509
This is a fancy ball.

276
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:47,512
This all belongs
to Black Dragon Fang, after all.

277
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:48,805
It really is overwhelming.

278
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:53,518
I heard White Tiger Claw has
similar establishments.

279
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:57,439
Truly the clans
that rule above others, huh?

280
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,193
Isn't that Saint Nin?

281
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:03,612
It is her.

282
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,405
Why is she attending our clan's ball?

283
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,364
Didn't you know?

284
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:11,119
Rumor has it that Saint Nin's clan
is becoming a subsidiary of ours.

285
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,705
Where did that come from?

286
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:17,042
And they make it sound
like Nin's the leader of our clan.

287
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,209
{\an8}Leader,

288
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,003
{\an8}you can't let them look down on us.

289
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:22,964
{\an8}Show them what we're made of.

290
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,383
{\an8}That was the plan.

291
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:29,888
<i>I had prepared myself for this,
but it is really uncomfortable here…</i>

292
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,222
Rud!

293
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,309
{\an8}Can I eat the food over there?

294
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,602
Yes.

295
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:36,686
Got it.

296
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:40,398
Marius's really good
at easing the tension.

297
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:42,817
Yes, we should get some food too.

298
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:50,659
Thank you all
for attending tonight's ball.

299
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,412
I am Ike,
the subleader of Black Dragon Fang.

300
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:57,624
I am Cynthia,
the subleader of White Tiger Claw.

301
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,670
<i>I thought the leaders of both clans
would be present.</i>

302
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,548
We have invited a special guest.

303
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:08,009
Saint Nin,

304
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,720
may we invite you to come on stage?

305
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:13,890
Rud,

306
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,726
those guys are calling me.

307
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,604
But I am Nin from your clan.

308
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:21,856
Yes.

309
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,318
{\an8}I'll go and correct them.

310
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,778
Can you come up with me?

311
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,117
Saint Nin,

312
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,911
I didn't expect you
to officially become an adventurer.

313
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,329
It's truly a surprise.

314
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,706
Is that so?

315
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:40,917
I've always wanted
to focus on being an adventurer.

316
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,795
May I ask who the man next to you is?

317
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,422
Who is that guy?

318
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,840
He's too close to the saint.

319
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,174
He is…

320
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:49,217
Nice to meet you.

321
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:53,430
I am Rud,
the leader of the clan Nin belongs to.

322
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:59,394
{\an8}Aren't you the man
who used to be part of the hero's party?

323
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,689
I remember your class was a tank, right?

324
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:07,068
The former hero even said
you were useless.

325
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:12,532
He consulted me
on his party formation issues many times.

326
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:17,412
So I suggested he just kick out the tank.

327
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,788
What?

328
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,376
Raiding labyrinths doesn't require a tank.

329
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,838
You say it doesn't need a tank?

330
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:27,756
That's right.

331
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,508
The tank is supposed to protect
the party from attacks,

332
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:32,802
but in reality, they serve no purpose.

333
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:33,887
Exactly.

334
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,014
If you must have one,
an evasive-type tank is…

335
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,725
{\an8}I will cut straight to the point.
Saint Nin,

336
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,478
won't you join our clan?

337
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,731
Staying in a no-name clan
will only hide your true potential…

338
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:48,485
Hold on! We need an excellent healer

339
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,320
to conquer the Keild Labyrinth too.

340
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,529
Enough.

341
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:54,115
I have no intention of handing over Nin.

342
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:56,910
Mister Rud.

343
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,288
Aren't you looking for a clan advisor?

344
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,708
But you wanted Nin in exchange.

345
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,212
I'm sorry,
but Nin is an important comrade.

346
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,589
I wouldn't trade her for anything.

347
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,674
So, why are you here?

348
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,635
{\an8}To form an alliance.

349
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,803
An alliance?

350
00:18:14,886 --> 00:18:16,846
Is he suggesting an alliance
with our clan?

351
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,932
Isn't he from some weak clan?

352
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,934
And he's just a tank.

353
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:22,519
This has to be a joke.

354
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,981
Just knowing a tank is the clan leader
is unsettling.

355
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,608
Saint Nin,

356
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,944
do you really want to be
around a man like this?

357
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,947
Yes, of course.

358
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,537
{\an8}Because he's the strongest tank
in the world!

359
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,626
May I borrow the mic?

360
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:53,758
We came here to conquer Keild Labyrinth.

361
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,511
We're better than everyone in this room.

362
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,096
You can laugh all you want.

363
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:01,933
But those who laugh now
will regret it later.

364
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,686
We will surpass your expectations.

365
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,313
We will conquer
the entire Keild Labyrinth,

366
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:10,316
a feat neither of the two major clans
have achieved.

367
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,736
We will achieve our goal.

368
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,909
That's a good-spirited young man.

369
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,704
I like people like that.

370
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,789
Leader…

371
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,499
You came.

372
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,126
Yes.

373
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,629
Ike, I've told you
not to underestimate newcomers.

374
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,047
That's a bad habit of yours.

375
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:34,382
But…

376
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,092
Rud, was it?

377
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,513
{\an8}I am Gothew,
the leader of Black Dragon Fang.

378
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:42,182
{\an8}Pleasure to meet you.

379
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:44,350
The pleasure is mine.

380
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,519
<i>Just by shaking hands,</i>

381
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,106
<i>you can tell
he's got extraordinary strength.</i>

382
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,401
<i>So this is the leader
of Black Dragon Fang.</i>

383
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,739
If this guy can conquer the labyrinth,

384
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,200
then I'll consider an alliance with them.

385
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,868
Stop hiding and say something.

386
00:20:03,453 --> 00:20:04,412
Goodness.

387
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,081
I was going to pretend I wasn't around.

388
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:08,791
Don't say that,

389
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,294
Miss Ryutel,
the leader of White Tiger Claw.

390
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:15,089
If this clan can conquer the labyrinth,

391
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:18,509
I might consider
the possibility of an alliance.

392
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:23,097
The condition being that you first
successfully conquer the labyrinth.

393
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:24,724
That's what she said, Rud.

394
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,019
Show us you're not all bluff.

395
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,107
That was a great speech!

396
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,401
Please let that go.

397
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:39,072
By the way,
why don't people know how strong you are?

398
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,950
{\an8}Because generally speaking,
you can't tell with just the eyes.

399
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,578
No… anyone with a certain level
of strength can tell.

400
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,288
That you're not an ordinary person.

401
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:50,792
Rud, you must conquer the labyrinth.

402
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:54,754
I don't like seeing you
being treated as a joke.

403
00:20:55,964 --> 00:20:57,632
Well then, I'm off to take a bath.

404
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,802
Don't give anyone any trouble.

405
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,303
I know.

406
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,055
Master.

407
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,392
You look tired.

408
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,146
It's not often I get to speak
in front of so many people.

409
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,233
{\an8}But you were very impressive, Master.

410
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,110
{\an8}I was very happy to hear that.

411
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,319
{\an8}Indeed.

412
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,863
{\an8}And, well…

413
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,324
Thank you

414
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:26,119
for standing up for me.

415
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:27,829
That made me really happy.

416
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,038
Of course.

417
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,790
You're my important comrade.

418
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,669
Anyway, I just wanted to thank you.

419
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:36,879
See you tomorrow.

420
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,176
<i>The labyrinth that even
the two major clans couldn't conquer.</i>

421
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,013
<i>It won't be easy,</i>

422
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,140
<i>but to protect my clan and friends,</i>

423
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:49,600
<i>I must</i>

424
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,812
{\an8}<i>conquer Keild Labyrinth.</i>
