1
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:19,103
<i>In an adventurer party,</i>

2
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:22,106
<i>there are usually various roles,
such as attackers and healers.</i>

3
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:25,776
<i>I, Rud, am a tank.</i>

4
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,154
<i>As the shield of the party,</i>

5
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:31,741
<i>my duty is to block enemy attacks
and protect my party members.</i>

6
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,535
<i>It's a role where I play the unsung hero.</i>

7
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:37,788
<i>This is the story
of how a little guy like me…</i>

8
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,877
<i>becomes the protagonist.</i>

9
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,933
Oh, Big Brother,

10
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,687
you never come back to see me.
I've been so lonely.

11
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:26,939
Manicia!

12
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:27,857
Rud.

13
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,151
I'm never going anywhere again.

14
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,069
{\an8}Rud!

15
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,321
What's the big deal, Nin?

16
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:36,407
I was having a great time in my fantasy…

17
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,784
Don't "what's the big deal" me.

18
00:02:38,868 --> 00:02:41,162
Please stop making weird faces
in the guild.

19
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:45,833
Sheesh.

20
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,210
Thinking about your little sister again?

21
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,461
You know me well.

22
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,590
{\an8}We're in the same party.
I know that much about you.

23
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,302
But you really like
your little sister, huh?

24
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,470
You should consider
picking up other interests.

25
00:02:58,554 --> 00:02:59,513
Such as?

26
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,225
Love… and stuff.

27
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,520
Nin, that's…

28
00:03:06,604 --> 00:03:08,022
Don't get the wrong--

29
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,482
But there's no one cuter than Manicia.

30
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:11,400
So irritating.

31
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,320
Hey, Rud, I'm serious.

32
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,738
Seriously speaking, though,

33
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,408
I've been trying to keep my mind
off of other things.

34
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,495
<i>The only way to save Manicia
from her incurable disease is</i>

35
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,375
<i>to obtain the labyrinth treasure
capable of granting all wishes.</i>

36
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:30,586
Rud…

37
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,840
But, considering my sorry state
from yesterday, forget about the treasure,

38
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:37,551
I let everyone down.

39
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,386
That's not true.

40
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,932
You did your duty as a tank.

41
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,559
<i>You weren't hit by the enemy,</i>

42
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:47,686
<i>but your shield force's effect decreased.</i>

43
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,396
<i>It wasn't just yesterday either.</i>

44
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,857
<i>During the recent labyrinth raids,</i>

45
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:54,652
<i>my shield force has been
weakening before I know it.</i>

46
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,696
I've been using up
a lot of recovery potions too.

47
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,241
That must've put
quite a burden on you, the healer.

48
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,825
I'm truly sorry.

49
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,077
What are you talking about?

50
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:06,830
You're the reason we've been able

51
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,332
to come this far.

52
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,002
I know you've been protecting me.

53
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:16,048
<i>Besides, your shield has 9,999 resistance.</i>

54
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,967
<i>That's the highest we've ever seen.</i>

55
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,426
Nin…

56
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,346
You're an excellent tank.

57
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,057
So, even if we get new party members,
stand tall and proud.

58
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,141
It's the hero!

59
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,728
I heard he's already conquered
several labyrinths at such a young age.

60
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,606
That's the great hero, Kygras, for you.

61
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,236
Yo, Rud.

62
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,405
Sorry, am I late?

63
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,948
No, just on time.

64
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,325
Good morning, Lilia, Lily.

65
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:47,746
Now that the party is all here,
let me introduce everyone.

66
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,747
Come over.

67
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,208
These are our new party members.

68
00:04:52,376 --> 00:04:53,669
Hold on, Kygras.

69
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,254
What's going on here?

70
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:57,881
The rule is that a party can only have
up to six members.

71
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,633
Doesn't this make it seven?

72
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,303
Don't worry.

73
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,346
The party will still have six.

74
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,391
Rud, you are dismissed as of today.

75
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,020
Why?

76
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,356
<i>Obviously,</i>

77
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,109
<i>because you failed to perform as a tank.</i>

78
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:21,113
Life Burst!

79
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:23,949
We did it!

80
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:27,453
<i>You lost your shield force
entirely yesterday.</i>

81
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:29,163
<i>That's the problem.</i>

82
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,165
What's going on?

83
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:32,750
Stop messing around!

84
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,044
How can we continue
with such a useless tank?

85
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,295
No…

86
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,421
Wait.

87
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,090
Rud blocked the attacks,

88
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,718
but the shield still wore off.

89
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,012
There must be some other reason behind it.

90
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,931
We know it's his skills.

91
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,643
-<i>His two skills with unknown effects.</i>
-Rud, come on!

92
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,777
It's true that not all skills are good,

93
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,697
but we still don't know for sure
if his skills were the cause of it.

94
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,324
-Yet…
-What are you going on about?

95
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,535
<i>If we weren't careful,
we could've been wiped out.</i>

96
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,662
<i>Isn't that enough reason to dismiss him?</i>

97
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,915
Besides, our new member here is

98
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,459
the evasion-type tank
that's all the rage these days.

99
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,629
She can even attack while she dodges.

100
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:22,424
She's a far cry from you,
who can only defend.

101
00:06:24,218 --> 00:06:25,719
For all these reasons,

102
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,930
you're dismissed.

103
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,811
He was let go.

104
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,271
It can't be helped…

105
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,486
I understand.

106
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,618
Rud…

107
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,287
Hey, I'm not finished yet.

108
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:55,624
Because of you,
we didn't get any rewards yesterday.

109
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,128
The highest endurance stats
we've ever seen? Bah.

110
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:02,756
You're just a lousy tank
who can't even use your shield properly.

111
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,180
We know you're capable.

112
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,015
Good luck.

113
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:19,815
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,900
You invited me to join the party,

115
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:24,111
but it seems
my abilities weren't up to par.

116
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,737
That's not true at all!

117
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:29,366
Rud, are you really leaving?

118
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:35,122
I told you about the town
my little sister and I live in, right?

119
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,166
Avancia, right?

120
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,667
What about it?

121
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,128
You can come find me there.

122
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,630
{\an8}I won't always be there,

123
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:47,176
{\an8}but I'm planning on moving back
to live with my sister there permanently.

124
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:48,886
That's why

125
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,262
we'll meet again someday.

126
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:56,977
But it's not like
I'll be that lonely without you.

127
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,563
I know.

128
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,566
I'm looking forward
to the next time we meet again.

129
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,823
So, what should I do now?

130
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,950
Though I want to return to Avancia…

131
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:16,330
You're just a lousy tank
who can't even use your shield properly.

132
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,081
<i>Was Kygras right?</i>

133
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,376
<i>That a skill of mine
was depleting my shield force?</i>

134
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,378
<i>Doesn't that make it a defective skill?</i>

135
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,174
<i>It makes me uneasy, but I don't know
anyone who can appraise it for me.</i>

136
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,761
Anyway, are we sure

137
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,846
we can handle this escort mission?

138
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,724
We've all risen to D-rank.
We can handle it just fine.

139
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,686
It should be okay
if it's just until Kurath.

140
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,189
But…

141
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,690
AVANCIA, KURATH
CURRENT LOCATION

142
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,235
Excuse me.

143
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,111
He's huge!

144
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,781
About that mission… May I join you?

145
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,200
I won't need any payment.

146
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,994
Well, what's your adventurer rank?

147
00:08:56,787 --> 00:08:59,790
<i>Truth be told, I'm still at F-rank</i>

148
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:02,626
<i>because of all the time
I spent in the labyrinths…</i>

149
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,586
-Stare…
-Stare…

150
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:06,755
I've seen him somewhere…

151
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:09,007
I remember now!

152
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,592
He was in the hero's party!

153
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,220
-Please join us!
-Please join us!

154
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,596
Actually, I…

155
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,514
Everyone.

156
00:09:16,682 --> 00:09:19,309
You must be the adventurers
who accepted the request.

157
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,269
Yes.

158
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,603
We have a new party member.

159
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:22,729
What's your name?

160
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,147
I… I'm Rud.

161
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,316
Mister Rud, yes?

162
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,484
I don't mind,

163
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,361
but I can't offer a higher reward.

164
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,490
Off we go, then.

165
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,700
Please.

166
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,496
<i>I missed the timing to tell them my rank.</i>

167
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,541
<i>I feel bad keeping it from them,
but there's no other choice.</i>

168
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,626
<i>I'll ensure their safety</i>

169
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,794
<i>until we get to Kurath.</i>

170
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,933
It's foggy.

171
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,519
Let's stop here for the night.

172
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,813
No, we're almost at Kurath, aren't we?

173
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,940
I have a bad feeling about this.

174
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,151
Let's cross this forest in one go.

175
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,152
I understand.

176
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,779
<i>As long as we keep
an eye out for ambushes,</i>

177
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,406
<i>we should reach Kurath safely.</i>

178
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,660
Please stop the carriage.

179
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,330
Is something the matter?

180
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,210
Is it a monster?

181
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,129
It could be bandits or something else.

182
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,297
You guys stay here.

183
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:38,889
You over there!

184
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,576
I don't sense anyone around.

185
00:11:00,369 --> 00:11:01,370
It's not a trap.

186
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,538
Are you all right?

187
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,502
There's no need to be scared.

188
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,212
I won't hurt you.

189
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:12,339
Can you stand?

190
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:18,637
She… She's naked!

191
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:20,931
<i>A magic stone?</i>

192
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:22,516
<i>Is she…</i>

193
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,020
Mister Rud, monster!

194
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,483
<i>It's the Forest Snake!</i>

195
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,822
It's massive!

196
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,740
Find cover.

197
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,869
This snake's venom is highly toxic.

198
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:43,954
You must be careful.

199
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,373
This isn't a monster we can defeat!

200
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,375
Are we going to die here?

201
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:53,171
Over here, Forest Snake!

202
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,298
<i>Taunt!</i>

203
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:06,810
Mister Rud!

204
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,353
It's fine.

205
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,939
My skill makes me
immune to status effects.

206
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,524
I'll distract it

207
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:13,900
so you guys can attack it.

208
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,777
Even if you say that…

209
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:17,028
What should we do?

210
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,113
<i>At this rate…</i>

211
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:32,586
Manicia!

212
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,214
Big Brother…

213
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:42,220
<i>I can't die here.</i>

214
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,264
You guys.

215
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,892
I don't have a sword with me.

216
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,687
We can't defeat this thing
unless you attack.

217
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,524
Grab your weapons and move.

218
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,652
We'll take it down together!

219
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,618
As the strongest tank,

220
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,119
I will block…

221
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:10,707
all of its attacks!

222
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,375
So, please,

223
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:14,127
believe in yourselves!

224
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,422
You will

225
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,716
conquer it!

226
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,720
Now!

227
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,562
That's…

228
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:33,563
Watch out!

229
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,440
It's using its ultimate attack!

230
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,693
Dodge!

231
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,654
<i>I can't do that.</i>

232
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,074
<i>Precisely because it's an ultimate attack…</i>

233
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,994
<i>I must block it.</i>

234
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,669
Now!

235
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,351
I can't believe
we defeated the Forest Snake!

236
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,812
We couldn't have done it on our own.

237
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,564
It's all thanks to Mister Rud.

238
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,608
It's because we all did our part.

239
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,444
Now, I'll leave you
to dismantle the monster.

240
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:23,446
I'm going to check on the girl.

241
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,283
Got it.

242
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,745
-Are you hurt?
-No.

243
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,164
That's good to hear.

244
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,085
You were running away
from that monster, right?

245
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:38,753
What are your plans after this?

246
00:14:40,881 --> 00:14:42,340
Do you have anywhere you can go?

247
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:45,635
I don't know where I should go…

248
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,637
In that case,

249
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,014
will you come with me?

250
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,351
I'm headed to a town named Avancia.

251
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,229
Can I?

252
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:57,814
If you don't mind.

253
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,775
Of course not.

254
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:06,197
All right. But…

255
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:09,159
you can't exactly go around
dressed like that.

256
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,495
If you don't mind,
you can have these clothes.

257
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,039
Are you sure?

258
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,290
Of course.

259
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,709
We'd be dead if it weren't for you.

260
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,586
Consider it a token of my appreciation.

261
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,463
Thank you.

262
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,340
Go get changed over there.

263
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,257
Okay.

264
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,304
Could that child be a runaway slave?

265
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,266
<i>That girl is a Homunculus.</i>

266
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,436
<i>Normally, an enslaved Homunculus</i>

267
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,522
<i>would never act on its own.</i>

268
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,858
<i>There might be something going on.</i>

269
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:46,237
Slave traders usually wouldn't go
through such a dangerous forest.

270
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,114
Plus, she doesn't have a collar on her.

271
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,534
I plan to keep her with me for now.

272
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,207
Thank you.

273
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,960
Is it all right for us
to drop you off here?

274
00:16:00,043 --> 00:16:01,252
Yes.

275
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,129
Well, then, we will take our leave now.

276
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:06,091
Please wait.

277
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,344
Mister Rud,
do you have a party at the moment?

278
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,346
No, I don't.

279
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,307
Then, will you join our party?

280
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:17,727
We'd like to take adventures
with a strong tank like you.

281
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,397
I appreciate the invitation,

282
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,149
but I'm on a search
for the labyrinth treasure.

283
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:24,693
<i>As in</i>

284
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,778
<i>the treasure that can grant any wish?</i>

285
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,531
<i>And the power to create Homunculi.</i>

286
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:30,615
<i>Yes, that's right.</i>

287
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,034
Homunculus, huh?

288
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:35,745
I'm not good at dealing with Homunculi.

289
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,956
They're always working emotionlessly.

290
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,374
I find that quite unsettling.

291
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,126
The only difference in appearance is

292
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,086
the magic stone embedded in their chests.

293
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,129
Still…

294
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,716
And that's why

295
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,593
I can't join your party. I'm sorry.

296
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,512
I see.

297
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,349
Mister Rud,

298
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:58,727
I'm sure your labyrinth raids
will be successful.

299
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,579
That reminds me.
I guess I haven't introduced myself yet.

300
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:18,955
My name is Rud.

301
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,750
Mister Rud…

302
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,834
What's your name?

303
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:29,466
I don't have a name.

304
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,592
I see.

305
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,054
Well, it'll be hard
to call you without one.

306
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,390
<i>Those are Lunafia petals.</i>

307
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,269
Luna.

308
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,274
Luna?

309
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,402
If you don't like it,
you can change it later.

310
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:50,862
No, it's fine.

311
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,865
Thank you for giving me a name.

312
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,041
Thank you for the food.

313
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,668
We should arrive in Avancia tomorrow.

314
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,212
Let's get an early night.

315
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,171
Okay.

316
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:34,364
<i>So Luna really is
an illegally created Homunculus.</i>

317
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:38,118
<i>She has free will and emotions
unlike regular Homunculi,</i>

318
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,786
<i>and she can even fight.</i>

319
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:44,249
<i>Normally, illegally created Homunculi
are supposed to be destroyed.</i>

320
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:46,751
<i>But her terrified expression</i>

321
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,378
<i>reminded me of Manicia.</i>

322
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,463
<i>I couldn't just leave her be.</i>

323
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,841
I'm sorry about the pot.

324
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:55,301
It's all right.
We've finished eating anyway.

325
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:56,761
That said,

326
00:18:56,845 --> 00:19:00,181
you should've been able to kill
the Forest Snake with your skills, no?

327
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:02,725
I… I'm more proficient in using magic.

328
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,687
I don't have any melee skills.

329
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,438
<i>Magic.</i>

330
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,441
<i>I wonder if she's able
to imitate and simulate magic skills.</i>

331
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,069
Do you have any magic skills?

332
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,572
I have a skill that enhances magic.

333
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,823
Anything else?

334
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,700
I have a support skill.

335
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:20,952
It's Appraisal.

336
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,745
I see. Appraisal, huh?

337
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,541
Appraisal?

338
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:27,458
Yes…

339
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,211
<i>Appraisal is an extremely rare skill.</i>

340
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:32,797
<i>Only one person
in a neighboring country had this skill.</i>

341
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,757
<i>That person passed away a few years ago.</i>

342
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,096
In other words, you're the only one
in the world who has Appraisal now.

343
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,683
I had no idea it was such a prized skill.

344
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,143
Luna.

345
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,104
Can you help appraise my skills?

346
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,315
Of… Of course.

347
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,399
Really?

348
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,568
It's my job, after all.

349
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,028
Now, then,

350
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,530
the skill requires
physical contact with the target,

351
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,032
so please excuse me.

352
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:03,411
You have four skills, Mister Rud.

353
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:05,705
<i>First, Taunt.</i>

354
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:09,209
<i>It's a skill that attracts as much
attention as possible from the enemy.</i>

355
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,753
<i>Next, Strong Body.</i>

356
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,796
<i>It makes the bearer
immune to status effects,</i>

357
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,131
<i>and enhances self-recovery</i>

358
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,884
<i>and maximizes the body's
vitality and strength.</i>

359
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:21,512
<i>I already knew about these two skills.
The real deal is what comes after.</i>

360
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,890
Then, you have Life Conversion.

361
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:25,767
<i>Life Conversion?</i>

362
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,185
<i>Life Conversion is a skill</i>

363
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:31,064
<i>that allows you to turn the shield force
consumed in battle into power.</i>

364
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,023
<i>So</i>

365
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,733
<i>it's an offensive skill?</i>

366
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:34,859
<i>It appears so.</i>

367
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:39,072
<i>It seems some skills cannot be invoked
until you understand it.</i>

368
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:40,990
Finally…

369
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,618
Sacrificial Shield.

370
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,620
Sacrificial Shield?

371
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,582
<i>The Sacrificial Shield
allows the wielder to bear the damage</i>

372
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,209
<i>inflicted on their comrades.</i>

373
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,337
<i>And it enhances the resilience
of both the comrades</i>

374
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,423
<i>and oneself while protecting the party.</i>

375
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,845
It transfers damage to myself?

376
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,347
Yes, that's right.

377
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,976
<i>So, the weakening of my shield force was</i>

378
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,230
<i>because I was protecting
my party members all along?</i>

379
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:15,984
Is something wrong?

380
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,610
Nothing.

381
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,446
It's just that my concern
over my unknown skills

382
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,450
that had been troubling me for so long
was resolved so easily.

383
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,662
Thank you, Luna.

384
00:21:27,745 --> 00:21:29,706
It's my honor to be of help.

385
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,214
<i>I was kicked out of the party
because of my skills</i>

386
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,882
<i>that I wasn't aware of.</i>

387
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,676
<i>But now I know</i>

388
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,637
<i>that my skills are the most powerful
for protecting my comrades.</i>

389
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,557
<i>I can return home with my head held high,</i>

390
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,185
<i>back to Avancia,
where my little sister awaits.</i>
