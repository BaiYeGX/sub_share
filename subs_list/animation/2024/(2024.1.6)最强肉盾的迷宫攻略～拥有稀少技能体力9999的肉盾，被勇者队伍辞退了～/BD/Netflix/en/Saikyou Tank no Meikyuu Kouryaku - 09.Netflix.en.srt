1
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:04,505
Aw.

2
00:00:05,381 --> 00:00:07,299
Are you already turning back?

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:12,221
Who's there?

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,811
<i>She's emitting such an intense aura…
Who is this girl?</i>

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,272
Rud, this is bad!

6
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:25,985
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:30,406
Did I set it so that
Dark Skeletons would continue to spawn?

8
00:00:31,365 --> 00:00:32,491
<i>"Set"?</i>

9
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:34,869
<i>If four of them attack at once…</i>

10
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,290
In one hit…

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,253
I didn't expect

12
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,630
a demon-lord-class guardian to appear.

13
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,715
Demon-lord-class?

14
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,929
I thought I'd already disabled that.

15
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:57,892
<i>Is this girl the labyrinth guardian?</i>

16
00:00:57,975 --> 00:01:00,895
Surrender yourself to my Demon Eye!

17
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,909
<i>What's with
this ridiculously powerful magic?</i>

18
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:41,370
<i>But I can still handle this much.</i>

19
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:46,959
You actually managed to get out of that
without a status ailment.

20
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:50,671
God's skill is indeed something.

21
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,715
Are you the guardian of this labyrinth?

22
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:54,133
Correct.

23
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:58,012
But you don't seem intimidated
by me at all.

24
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:01,473
After all, you look like a cute girl.

25
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,560
"Cute"?

26
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,604
My, you have such a way with words.

27
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,022
Don't be fooled, Rud!

28
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,316
She's a 300-year-old granny!

29
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,485
Silence, Marius!

30
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:16,405
You are but a fallen demon lord!

31
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:19,116
Marius is my friend.

32
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,201
I ask that you do not harm him.

33
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,996
I see.

34
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,917
The fallen demon lord
has joined the likes of humans.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,210
Not exactly.

36
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,546
I simply dislike
the rest of you demon lords.

37
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,800
I see…

38
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,219
Regardless,

39
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:40,930
do not get in my way, Demon Lord Marius.

40
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:45,226
You should be aware
that you are no match for us.

41
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,563
Marius might not be able
to take you down on his own,

42
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,692
but you're up against more than just him.

43
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:57,821
And?

44
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:02,076
Your powers are far
from those of a demon lord.

45
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,788
It's true that alone,
a human's power is nothing to fear.

46
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,415
We can't conquer labyrinths alone.

47
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,293
That is why we form parties.

48
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,295
To raid them together?

49
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:16,507
Then let's see if you can defeat me,

50
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,759
the guardian of the Keild Labyrinth,
Amon Sloth,

51
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,263
with your so-called teamwork.

52
00:04:23,097 --> 00:04:25,474
Foolish humans!

53
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,935
Such powerful magic!

54
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,728
We just have to take her on.

55
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,939
Sacrificial Shield!

56
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,110
Taunt!

57
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,365
Such power…

58
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,497
How dare you hurt my sister!

59
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,126
She deflected it with a tornado.

60
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,836
Even with Taunt,

61
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,463
she won't focus only on me.

62
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,092
Although it's impressive,

63
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,177
this level of attack won't hurt me at all.

64
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,388
We'll keep attacking until we do.

65
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:06,098
I can easily evade

66
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,933
that kind of attack with wind magic…

67
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,436
Don't think you can stay
in the air forever!

68
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,478
That hurt…

69
00:05:12,104 --> 00:05:13,939
What a nuisance…

70
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,905
Her physical strength is no joke.

71
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,866
How do we break through?

72
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,826
Don't worry, I can keep up with her.

73
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,537
Is this the extent of your abilities?

74
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,705
Taunt!

75
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:32,541
What's the matter?

76
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:35,669
You won't get me
with those random attacks.

77
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:37,129
I'm not attacking randomly.

78
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,550
Flash magic stone!

79
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,178
What's that? It's blinding!

80
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,517
How about that?

81
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:55,981
What is that?

82
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:58,859
Is this tempest the result
of the magic overflow from earlier?

83
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:01,862
It appears I was careless.

84
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:05,032
My apologies.

85
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,995
Nin, heal everyone up.

86
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,288
Got it.

87
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,707
I'll also cast some buffs.
Gather around, everyone.

88
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:18,712
She is on an entirely different level
from the monsters we've faced before.

89
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,339
Yeah.

90
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,635
But as long as we stand united,
no monster is our match.

91
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,597
I will fight hard
for Master and Lady Manicia.

92
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,848
Me too.

93
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,600
Same here, of course.

94
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,518
Count me in.

95
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,062
After all, this is a chance
to defeat a demon lord.

96
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:37,981
Great.

97
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,733
We'll attack once the storm calms.

98
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,076
A wolf?

99
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,537
It looks just like a Fenrir.

100
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,211
Marius, can you fight
in your monster form?

101
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:02,422
If you don't mind me
attacking indiscriminately.

102
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,717
Suppose it's better
for you to stay in this form then.

103
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,596
<i>This will reduce</i>

104
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,433
<i>her chances
of attacking the other attackers.</i>

105
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:19,148
<i>Next, let's see how long I can hold up</i>

106
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:20,899
<i>against this giant monster.</i>

107
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,781
That hardly did any damage to her.

108
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,033
Her fur is as tough as an armor.

109
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:31,743
Keep your eyes on me!

110
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,582
<i>Those fangs are no joke.</i>

111
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:38,542
<i>But her attacks have gotten much simpler.</i>

112
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,753
<i>My shield force is draining fast…</i>

113
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:43,714
Prepare to cast long-distance magic.

114
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,513
Doesn't seem very effective.

115
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,307
It's a battle against the guardian.

116
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,601
We've been prepared for this
to be a long fight.

117
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,272
<i>Her attacks are actually getting stronger!</i>

118
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,608
<i>Dang, I can't catch a break.</i>

119
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,278
Sorry, Rud.

120
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:07,279
Took me some time

121
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,989
to gather my strength.

122
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,699
You're good, don't worry about it.

123
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,785
<i>He actually cut through that fur armor.</i>

124
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:15,329
<i>As expected of Marius.</i>

125
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,502
Why is she howling?

126
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:23,879
Rud, just in case,

127
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:27,090
I'm casting spells on you three
to nullify status ailments.

128
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,135
I can't heal you guys in the meantime,
so be careful.

129
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,220
Got it.

130
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:37,100
Rud, are you okay?

131
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:39,978
I'm fine.
My shield force seems to be holding up.

132
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,231
<i>As long as I don't go down,</i>

133
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,941
<i>with their strength, we won't lose.</i>

134
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,526
<i>We have to keep pushing through.</i>

135
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,993
<i>I'll persist until the end.</i>

136
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,467
Taunt!

137
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,387
She's resilient.

138
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,430
But her movements
are starting to slow down.

139
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,518
What's going on?

140
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,396
What's with that green gust?

141
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,855
Whatever it is,

142
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,983
I'll slice it apart!

143
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,027
Marius!

144
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,029
Judging from that attack,

145
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,491
it seems to be a wind barrier
that slashes anyone who comes near it.

146
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,578
The magic stone on her forehead

147
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,580
didn't shine so brightly

148
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,290
before she put up the barrier.

149
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,668
Maybe if we destroy that stone,
we'll be able to defeat her.

150
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,837
But we can't get close to her
with that gust.

151
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,840
Nin, use your magic to cancel it.

152
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,092
After that, we'll attack together.

153
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,051
Got it.

154
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,929
In the radiance of the holy light,

155
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,514
the power of darkness…

156
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,516
We need to buy time for Nin.

157
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,191
Quietly emerging within
the unseen brilliance of white waves…

158
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,818
<i>It's getting hard to breathe</i>

159
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:11,820
<i>because of the wind.</i>

160
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,822
<i>Just that alone is hard enough,</i>

161
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:16,116
<i>and we've still got to deal
with the wind blades.</i>

162
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,284
<i>This is hell…</i>

163
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,244
With the light of mercy
shining into the darkness…

164
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:21,455
-<i>I have to hold on.</i>
-Dissipate in silence.

165
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,497
<i>Prepare yourselves!</i>

166
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,499
<i>We'll hold on.</i>

167
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,670
She's not letting us get closer.

168
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:30,088
Render it all void!

169
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,133
Cease your pointless struggle.

170
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,513
I've removed the wind barrier.

171
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,057
Destroy the stone now!

172
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,058
All right!

173
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:44,645
You won't escape!

174
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,400
<i>She blocked all the attacks
on the magic stone.</i>

175
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,819
<i>But in doing so,
she also left her chest vulnerable.</i>

176
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:55,364
Get her, Rud!

177
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,867
<i>My shield force has been depleted
by almost 30,000.</i>

178
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,410
Take this!

179
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,163
Life Conversion!

180
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,668
That's…

181
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,837
different from a barrier.

182
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,840
That's offensive wind magic!

183
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,426
Everyone, dodge!

184
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:19,346
<i>Oh, no!</i>

185
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,225
That's the sound of the shield breaking.

186
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:26,436
Rud!

187
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:32,401
<i>I must hold on…</i>

188
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,488
<i>If I use up all my shield force</i>

189
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,823
<i>and get seriously injured,</i>

190
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,200
<i>I'll die!</i>

191
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,750
Rud…

192
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,212
Has it stopped?

193
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:54,714
Rud, are you all right?

194
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:56,591
Yeah, I barely made it through.

195
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,802
Lilia!

196
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:00,804
Marius!

197
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:01,805
Lilia!

198
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:03,807
Hang in there!

199
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,768
Rud…

200
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:09,980
Thank goodness you two are still alive.

201
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,737
Luna, Nin,

202
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:19,030
heal them.

203
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,366
They'll be killed
if she launches another attack.

204
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:23,827
You've used up all your shield force.

205
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,911
It's too dangerous.

206
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,122
I can still use my skills without it.

207
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,165
I can still fight.

208
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:31,418
Besides, I'm the only one here
who can stop her.

209
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:32,794
Got it.

210
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,588
Luna. Lily.

211
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,549
<i>Moreover, I'm the one who selfishly</i>

212
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,050
<i>dragged everyone here.</i>

213
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,094
<i>They came because of me.</i>

214
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,305
<i>It's my responsibility
to protect all of them.</i>

215
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,104
<i>I'm feeling the pain without the shield…</i>

216
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,398
<i>At this rate, I'm going to be crushed!</i>

217
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,109
<i>Wind magic?</i>

218
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:58,904
<i>No?</i>

219
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,200
She can't use any more magic.

220
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,745
She's weak.

221
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,289
<i>We're so close…</i>

222
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:10,957
I hate to say it,

223
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,667
but we'll have to retreat for now…

224
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:14,419
I can still fight.

225
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,090
Nin, Luna, prepare your magic.

226
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:20,425
From now on,

227
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,552
I'll be the attacker.

228
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,555
Lily, what are you saying?

229
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,226
I'll use Fusion and take Lilia's place.

230
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,770
All it takes is a little more
and we will defeat her.

231
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,396
-But…
-Rud.

232
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,441
You said you'd listen to my request.

233
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:38,485
I can still fight!

234
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,446
What a reckless one.

235
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,448
I understand.

236
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:44,824
I'll block all the attacks.

237
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:45,992
I'll help too.

238
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,286
Let's take her down with all we have!

239
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:50,497
Yes!

240
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,251
<i>I didn't realize how much power I'd lose</i>

241
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,628
<i>without my shield.</i>

242
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,129
<i>But,</i>

243
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,090
<i>I've got to buy her time.</i>

244
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,303
Rud!

245
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,513
Thanks, Nin.

246
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,473
Lily, are you ready?

247
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,309
Ready.

248
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,357
I'm not done yet.

249
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:25,824
Rud!

250
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,703
<i>Her speed isn't too different
from when Lilia's in control,</i>

251
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,329
<i>but unlike her,</i>

252
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:32,706
<i>Lily's moves are too simple.</i>

253
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,040
<i>They're too predictable.</i>

254
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,001
Sorry.

255
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,795
I'm not used to this body yet.

256
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,505
In that case,

257
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:42,424
fight as you usually do.

258
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,719
Lilia's out cold anyway.

259
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:46,970
Don't worry about her.

260
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,724
Fight in your own way.

261
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,143
My own way?

262
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,979
I'll buy you time
until you get used to it.

263
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:57,981
So take your time.

264
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,358
Got it.

265
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:02,611
<i>Although,</i>

266
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:06,156
<i>given the current situation,
it's a tall order,</i>

267
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,076
<i>but my comrade
is fighting so hard to change.</i>

268
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:12,621
<i>So, it's my job</i>

269
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,997
<i>to support her.</i>

270
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,167
Rud!

271
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,543
{\an8}<i>Curses.</i>

272
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,711
{\an8}<i>In my current state,</i>

273
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,505
{\an8}<i>it's really hard for me
to do my job as the tank.</i>

274
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,633
{\an8}<i>I think I'm going to pass out
from the pain…</i>

275
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,511
<i>No, these are just excuses.</i>

276
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,597
<i>No matter what happens,</i>

277
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,599
<i>it's my job to protect my party.</i>

278
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,104
<i>Marius used mana as his shield force.</i>

279
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,106
<i>If I do the same,</i>

280
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,025
<i>maybe I can continue to fight.</i>

281
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,611
Rud, she's heading towards you!

282
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,532
<i>It's not perfect, but it worked.</i>

283
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,534
<i>Still, this isn't enough.</i>

284
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:56,581
<i>I need to focus my mana
and transform it into my shield force!</i>

285
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:02,295
<i>I can move just like
when I still had my shield force.</i>

286
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:04,297
<i>The pain in my arm is fading too.</i>

287
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,383
<i>So that's how you do it.</i>

288
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,345
<i>She sped up her attacks.</i>

289
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:11,638
<i>Is she getting anxious?</i>

290
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:15,266
<i>Unleash more mana.</i>

291
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,438
I can move as freely as I did
when I had my shield force surrounding me.

292
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,399
Time for the counterattack!

293
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,568
Lily, now!

294
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,904
This is different from Lilia.

295
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,532
This is my way of fighting!

296
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,538
What power!

297
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,417
Did she enchant the sword
with all elements?

298
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,212
Let's end it with this!

299
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,425
She's planning to strike
with all four elements at once!

300
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,196
Lily! Are you okay?

301
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,614
I'm okay…

302
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,117
Thank you, Rud.

303
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,994
That's my line.

304
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:18,455
We won today because of you.

305
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,499
It wasn't just me.

306
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,798
Now, take a little break.

307
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:30,800
Amon,

308
00:17:30,884 --> 00:17:32,218
do you want to continue?

309
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,513
I cannot even move anymore.

310
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:37,015
You put up an excellent fight.

311
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,602
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be defeated.

312
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,438
I'm looking for a magic stone
that can grant any wish.

313
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,607
Do you know anything about that?

314
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,777
Here, take it.

315
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:51,613
Thanks.

316
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:55,992
{\an8}Never expected my opponent to thank me.
That is a surprise indeed.

317
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:58,703
Well? Are you not delivering
the final blow?

318
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:02,957
Or are you perhaps the type
that enjoys tormenting pretty girls?

319
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,419
You said you were a demon lord.

320
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:08,797
Are there any other demon lords?

321
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,007
Of course.

322
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,093
Though, I do not know the exact number.

323
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,345
What is their objective?

324
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:19,390
Among demon lords, there is a popular game

325
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:24,771
of how to destroy this world.

326
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,444
And what is your goal?

327
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:34,656
Do you seek to be an enemy
of the humans as a demon lord?

328
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:37,325
Or do you just want
to fight strong opponents?

329
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,702
You have an intention.

330
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,371
Yes.

331
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,248
Speak away.

332
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,209
Will you help us?

333
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,129
If the demon lords

334
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,589
are coming after the humans,

335
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:53,466
I plan to gather forces to resist them.

336
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:58,138
{\an8}Then simply put a slave bracelet on me
and make me obey your command.

337
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,390
I don't like
to force others against their will.

338
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,433
That's why I'm asking.

339
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,771
An amusing one you are, indeed.

340
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,151
Well, I'm not particularly
attached to my identity as a demon lord.

341
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:14,612
Rather,
since you have extended an invitation,

342
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,408
I shall gladly become your ally.

343
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,286
Thank you.

344
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:23,496
Now, let's return to the city…

345
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:25,206
What's the matter?

346
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,125
I am tired.

347
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,170
I can't take another step. Carry me.

348
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:31,421
Eh?

349
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,922
<i>And thus,</i>

350
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,674
<i>we successfully persuaded Amon Sloth,</i>

351
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,594
<i>the guardian of Keild Labyrinth,
to join our forces.</i>

352
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,429
<i>After that,</i>

353
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,140
<i>the two major clans held another ball.</i>

354
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,057
<i>And I…</i>

355
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,103
We've successfully raided Keild Labyrinth.

356
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,439
Is this the map of the 51st floor?

357
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,648
You're kidding!

358
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,775
In exchange for this map and information,

359
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,486
I request an alliance with the two clans.

360
00:19:56,654 --> 00:19:58,656
<i>I announced that in front of everyone.</i>

361
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,033
<i>Of course,</i>

362
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,702
<i>I didn't reveal that the guardian
had become our ally.</i>

363
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,080
<i>After successfully forming
an alliance with them,</i>

364
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,124
<i>we embarked on our journey
back to Avancia.</i>

365
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,586
<i>I want to see Manicia soon…</i>

366
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:13,254
Rud.

367
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,340
Rud.

368
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,008
Li…

369
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:20,178
Shh. You'll wake everyone.

370
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,682
Thank you for your help
in the labyrinth battle.

371
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,601
It's nothing. And I told you, didn't I?

372
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,186
It was thanks to you…

373
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,314
We won because of everyone's efforts.

374
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,484
But it was thanks to you
that I could fight until the end.

375
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,529
Thank you.

376
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,115
I'm going back to sleep.

377
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,119
<i>What was that about?</i>

378
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,704
<i>And she fell asleep right away.</i>

379
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:50,124
<i>I'll just have to ask her later
what that kiss meant.</i>

380
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,001
<i>I should just sleep…</i>

381
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:52,919
Rud.

382
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,088
<i>Lilia!</i>

383
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:57,131
<i>Did she see that?</i>

384
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,634
{\an8}Thank you for what you did
in the labyrinth.

385
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,595
{\an8}I heard your voice.

386
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:04,597
{\an8}That's all.

387
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,474
Oh… Okay…

388
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,687
<i>After arriving in Avancia,</i>

389
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,106
<i>we rushed to Manicia.</i>

390
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,984
Manicia, use this magic stone.

391
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:17,819
How do you feel?

392
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,447
I feel so much better.

393
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,993
Thank you so much, Miss Amon.

394
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,123
There's not much I can do for you,

395
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,791
but I'll put my best effort

396
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:34,335
into preparing three meals
and afternoon tea for you.

397
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,671
So, please enjoy yourself

398
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,465
during your stay here.

399
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:44,971
Being warmly welcomed
by such a lovely human is a delight.

400
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,724
And the snacks are delicious too.

401
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,729
I shall remain in this town
for the time being.
