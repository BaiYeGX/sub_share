1
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,675
So this is Avancia?

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,677
It's a peaceful town.

3
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,137
That's right.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,555
There isn't much going on,

5
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,056
but it's a nice place.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,600
I hope you come to like it too.

7
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:19,228
Rud!

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,691
How long are you staying this time?

9
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:28,154
If you're not in a hurry,
let's take a day just for ourselves.

10
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,115
Rud.

11
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:33,409
I didn't know you were returning today.

12
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,291
It's been a while, you two.

13
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,209
What are you up to?

14
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,587
I'm on my way to buy a hammer.

15
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,006
Fil is patrolling.

16
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:48,340
Yes.

17
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:50,301
I checked in on Manicia.

18
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:51,594
She is doing well.

19
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:53,429
I see.

20
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,556
Thank you.

21
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,934
It's thanks to the townsfolk
keeping an eye out for her

22
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:01,062
that I can go on adventures without worry.

23
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:03,022
No need to thank us.

24
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:05,441
By the way, who is the little girl?

25
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,027
She's Luna.
I met her during my adventures.

26
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,905
She didn't have a place to go,

27
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,616
{\an8}so I figured I'd let her stay with me
for the time being.

28
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,242
I see.

29
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:17,745
Hello there, Luna.

30
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,539
I'm the pretty girl
at the blacksmith, Milena.

31
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:21,832
Nice to meet you.

32
00:01:23,834 --> 00:01:24,835
Your turn.

33
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,881
My name is Fil.

34
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,301
I'm the vice leader
of the town's vigilante corps.

35
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,304
Fil is shy.

36
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,472
Cut it out, Rud!

37
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:21,410
My little sister might be sleeping.

38
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,413
We have to be quiet
so we don't wake her up.

39
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:26,624
<i>This smell…</i>

40
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,252
<i>These are my favorite tomato dishes.</i>

41
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,051
Big Brother, welcome home.

42
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,431
Who is this?

43
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,933
<i>Who is this?</i>

44
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,434
<i>Who is this?</i>

45
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,894
<i>Who is this?</i>

46
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:50,147
<i>Who is this?</i>

47
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,275
I'm home, Manicia!

48
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,321
This is Luna. I met her along my way back.

49
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,031
She ran into some trouble,

50
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,116
so I decided
to bring her back here for now.

51
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,785
I see.

52
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,788
<i>It's been so long
since I last saw Manicia.</i>

53
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,289
<i>She's still as cute as ever.</i>

54
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,501
<i>For a moment,
I thought a goddess had appeared.</i>

55
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,337
It's nice to meet you, Miss Luna.

56
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,588
I'm Manicia.

57
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:18,217
It isn't anything fancy,
but please make yourself at home.

58
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,178
Thank you…

59
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:22,263
All right.

60
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,974
Big Brother, you've had a long journey.
You must be tired.

61
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:27,101
Have a seat and eat.

62
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,771
I'll prepare another portion.

63
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,147
Wait.

64
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,066
You're frail. Don't push yourself.

65
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,860
I feel perfectly fine today,
so I'll be all right.

66
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,029
Why don't we prepare it together, then?

67
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:42,866
I suppose. Let's do that, then.

68
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,618
Um…

69
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,412
Lady Manicia's hair…

70
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:49,748
First time seeing
someone with unique abilities?

71
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,419
For Manicia, it's her hair.

72
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,338
Her hair moves according to her mood.

73
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:57,881
I see.

74
00:04:58,882 --> 00:04:59,717
Manicia.

75
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,096
Seems like you knew I was coming home.
Is that the effect of the skill?

76
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,266
Well, something like that.

77
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:10,978
Even so, you prepared
my favorite dishes for me.

78
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,480
I'm so touched I could cry.

79
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,316
You silly.

80
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:18,152
{\an8}You two are very close.

81
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,779
{\an8}Isn't this normal?

82
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,119
Big Brother, please start helping.

83
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:32,833
-I'm digging in.
-I'm digging in.

84
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,170
Miss Luna.

85
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,672
The way you hold your spoon is
peculiar indeed.

86
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,967
I… I'm sorry…

87
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,180
I've only ever used it a few times…

88
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,108
{\an8}I'm sorry.

89
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,069
{\an8}I'll do better.

90
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,654
{\an8}-Luna…
-It's not necessary to apologize.

91
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,745
You hold a spoon like this.

92
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:19,338
I'll teach you.

93
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,548
Let's take it one step at a time.

94
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,428
{\an8}Thank you very much…

95
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,570
Sir Rud. Lady Manicia.

96
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,531
Good morning.

97
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,700
Did you prepare all this by yourself?

98
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:49,618
Yes.

99
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,622
These are all the dishes Lady Manicia
taught me over the past three days.

100
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,251
-Delicious!
-Delicious!

101
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,962
<i>It tastes exactly like Manicia's cooking.</i>

102
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,339
<i>In only a few days,</i>

103
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,884
<i>Luna's mastered
all the fundamentals of everyday life.</i>

104
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:10,139
<i>Is this the Homunculus's
astounding learning ability?</i>

105
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:11,974
Big Brother.

106
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:15,227
The weather is lovely today.

107
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,063
You should give Miss Luna
a tour of the town.

108
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,690
Good idea.

109
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,984
I'd like to introduce Luna
to the townsfolk.

110
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,779
I'll lend her some of my clothes, then.

111
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,574
I have a few sets that she can wear.

112
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:33,495
<i>Manicia is adorable
when she acts like a big sister too.</i>

113
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,332
But this one might be
a little difficult to put on.

114
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,959
I'll help you.

115
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,672
Sorry…

116
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,425
I'll do it myself.

117
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,346
Was it something I did?

118
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,766
<i>That was probably a defensive reflex.</i>

119
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,810
<i>She didn't want to reveal her magic stone.</i>

120
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:04,067
There is no Adventurers' Guild
or church in Avancia.

121
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,696
Only a blacksmith and a pharmacy.

122
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,448
If there's anything that stands out,

123
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,825
it's probably the orchard.

124
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,744
Well, if it isn't Rud.

125
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,705
Here to give me grandchildren
with my daughter?

126
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,291
No, Mr. Regil.

127
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:22,211
Luna, this is Milena's father.

128
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,837
I've heard about you from Milena.

129
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,547
Nice to meet you, Miss.

130
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:27,257
Hello…

131
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:30,219
That reminds me, Mr. Regil…

132
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,930
I see.

133
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,349
You lost your magic sword.

134
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,644
All right. Since it's a request from Rud,

135
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,232
I'll make you a super sword
in the shortest amount of time I can.

136
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,525
Thank you very much.

137
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,486
Is it okay if I let my daughter help?

138
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,822
<i>Her skills are as good as mine.</i>

139
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:51,990
Of course.

140
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,493
I'll come back for it when it's ready.

141
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,994
Wait.

142
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,373
Why don't you show Luna
the magic greens garden?

143
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,292
Simply put,

144
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,836
magic greens are vegetables
that grow into monsters.

145
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,506
They're cultivated by magic,

146
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,883
so the harvests are not restricted
by seasons

147
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:11,885
and they're highly nutritious.

148
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,804
It's Rud!

149
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,847
He's with his girlfriend!

150
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,683
She is not my girlfriend.

151
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,935
Her name is Luna. She's my companion.

152
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,813
Right, I should've known that.

153
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,439
He has a sister complex.

154
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,942
Where did you learn
an archaic term like that?

155
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,319
-From Fil.
-From Fil.

156
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:31,905
You boys!

157
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:35,075
What are you kids doing here?

158
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,911
Back to work in the fields!

159
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,966
It's Granny Gigi!

160
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:53,343
You're as healthy as ever.

161
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,178
Oh, it's Rud.

162
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,684
Your girlfriend?

163
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,102
No.

164
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,438
Luna, this is Granny Gigi.

165
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,774
She's the town pharmacist.

166
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,444
She's made a lot of medicines for Manicia.

167
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,071
Let's get along, Luna.

168
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:15,032
Yes…

169
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:19,745
She reminds me of how Manicia used to be.

170
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:24,541
Yes.

171
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,712
I wish I could do more to help,

172
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,757
but medicines alone aren't enough
to cure the root of her illness.

173
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,675
You've already done a lot to help us.

174
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:34,885
Thanks to you,

175
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,970
she feels much better now.

176
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,430
Is that so?

177
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,557
{\an8}And you too, Luna.
If you ever need any help,

178
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:42,893
{\an8}come to my pharmacy.

179
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,229
You children are all like my own.

180
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:47,648
Oh, right.

181
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,068
I'm on my way to harvest some spinach.

182
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,444
Would you like to join me?

183
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:56,073
{\an8}Rud, you finally brought a woman back?

184
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,866
{\an8}No more sister complex for you?

185
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:03,330
All right. Behave.

186
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:26,103
Sorry.

187
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,604
It's a small town,

188
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,315
so gossip is about
the only entertainment around here.

189
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,233
I don't mind.

190
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:34,486
Well, it's probably also because
you're cute,

191
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,655
so they can't leave you alone.

192
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,698
Um, no…

193
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,701
Why… Why don't you try
some of the magic greens we plucked?

194
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:43,203
Good… Good idea.

195
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:47,791
It's good!

196
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,501
I'm glad you like it.

197
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,586
I'm sure everyone
will be happy to hear that.

198
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:54,756
Avancia is a quiet place

199
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,633
compared to other towns,

200
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,010
but I like it here.

201
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,472
What about you?

202
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,394
<i>The people here are very kind to me.</i>

203
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:11,148
<i>I'm glad to be in such a nice place.</i>

204
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,443
<i>If I could stay here forever,</i>

205
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,487
<i>I don't know how happy I would be.</i>

206
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:25,537
Do you feel something in my chest?

207
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,166
It's a magic stone, right?

208
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,127
Yes.

209
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:34,838
You may not believe it,

210
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,591
but I am actually not a human.

211
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,510
I'm a combat-type Homunculus developed

212
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,180
<i>by the neighboring country Brunn Quelez.</i>

213
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:47,851
I'm sorry for keeping it from you.

214
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,395
Because I didn't want to say it.

215
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,732
I was afraid
that if people knew I was a Homunculus,

216
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,901
I would be destroyed.

217
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,487
But…

218
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,238
you've helped me so much.

219
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,659
{\an8}I couldn't keep deceiving you…

220
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,370
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:11,124
I've been keeping something from you too.

222
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,084
Actually, I knew it.

223
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,545
That you are a Homunculus.

224
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:19,132
<i>I happened to see the magic stone on you.</i>

225
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,467
<i>So,</i>

226
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,011
<i>why did you help me?</i>

227
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:25,639
<i>Before coming here,</i>

228
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,350
<i>Manicia and I used to live in the slums.</i>

229
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,311
<i>The look in your eyes was</i>

230
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,063
<i>like Manicia's back then,</i>

231
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:34,898
<i>and I just couldn't leave you alone.</i>

232
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:36,858
<i>Even though</i>

233
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,360
<i>we lived in a place like that,</i>

234
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:40,779
<i>we wanted to live like humans.</i>

235
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,157
<i>What about you, Luna?</i>

236
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:46,993
Do you want to live as a Homunculus

237
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,119
or a human?

238
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,163
Can you tell me

239
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:53,416
how you really feel?

240
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,504
For a Homunculus like me,

241
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,632
that's wishful thinking.

242
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,468
Is that so?

243
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:07,264
I've never heard of a rule
that says a Homunculus can't be human.

244
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:09,224
Besides,

245
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:12,227
I've been raiding labyrinths
for a similar reason.

246
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,272
<i>To cure Manicia,</i>

247
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,900
<i>I've been searching
for the labyrinth treasure</i>

248
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,235
that might not even exist.

249
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:25,031
We both have
seemingly unattainable aspirations.

250
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,826
Doesn't that make us the perfect friends?

251
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,040
<i>I…</i>

252
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:36,918
<i>If it's here…</i>

253
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,130
<i>If it's by his side…</i>

254
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:43,967
<i>Maybe my wish could really come true…</i>

255
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,636
I…

256
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,639
want to live as a human.

257
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,392
I understand.

258
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:55,228
Let's get along, Luna.

259
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,773
Yes, Master.

260
00:14:58,857 --> 00:15:03,278
Wouldn't calling me "Master"
be too Homunculus-like?

261
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,487
Is that so?

262
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,990
But for some reason,

263
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,409
I wish to call you that.

264
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:11,411
I see.

265
00:15:14,623 --> 00:15:15,624
Lady Manicia,

266
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,709
I have something to tell you.

267
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,379
Are you sure about this?

268
00:15:21,463 --> 00:15:22,464
Yes.

269
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:25,258
I don't want to hide it
from people I care about anymore.

270
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,261
I am a Homunculus.

271
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:31,514
I am very sorry for hiding it from you.

272
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:38,855
So that's why you were a little different.

273
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,148
Will you still

274
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,025
be my friend?

275
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,110
Of course.

276
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,826
You knew, didn't you, Big Brother?

277
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:56,539
<i>Reaching your hand out
to those with no one to turn to…</i>

278
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,708
<i>That part of you</i>

279
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:02,963
<i>hasn't changed at all.</i>

280
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,550
Finally done with the cleaning.

281
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,095
I'm exhausted.

282
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,012
I'm starving.

283
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:13,473
Thank you for your help, Master.

284
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,225
Thank you as well.

285
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,144
Sorry for making you help
with the clean-up too.

286
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,854
It's not a problem at all.

287
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:20,939
Anyway,

288
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,233
this is a huge estate.

289
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,862
Everyone, I made tea.

290
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:28,780
What?

291
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,366
Tea prepared by Manicia?

292
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,120
Lady Manicia is popular indeed.

293
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,788
Huh?

294
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,333
I will be the first
to drink Manicia's tea!

295
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:49,217
Manicia's tea is especially great
when I'm the first to get to drink it.

296
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,844
It's all the same.

297
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,638
Rud, your sister complex
really knows no bounds.

298
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,348
I told you to stop saying that.

299
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,642
Manicia, how are you feeling?

300
00:16:57,726 --> 00:16:59,519
You said you were feeling fine today,

301
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,812
but helping us is…

302
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,939
All I did was make tea.

303
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,941
Big Brother, you worry too much.

304
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:05,859
But…

305
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,487
My body may be frail,

306
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,907
{\an8}but I don't want to be a burden to you.

307
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:14,951
Manicia…

308
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:17,412
I've told you, haven't I?

309
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,539
You're never a burden to me.

310
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,041
Hey, Rud!

311
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:22,584
We're done with the clean-up.

312
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,711
Why don't we have a spar?
It's been a while.

313
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,379
A spar?

314
00:17:26,463 --> 00:17:28,131
It's just a friendly spar.

315
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,842
<i>This is the perfect chance.</i>

316
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,052
Guys,

317
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,055
can you wait until I've sparred with Fil?

318
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,598
Me?

319
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:39,726
I see.

320
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,730
You want to test the skills
you didn't know about through sparring.

321
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:44,898
That's right.

322
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,108
If it's against the vice leader
of the vigilante corps,

323
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,943
I should be able to go all out.

324
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:53,323
If I weaken your shield force
by a great deal, you lose.

325
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,365
That works, right?

326
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,492
Sure.

327
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,620
Get ready.

328
00:17:58,703 --> 00:17:59,579
Begin!

329
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,333
Neither of them moved.

330
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,545
Well, they're not the kind
to win a battle with speed.

331
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:10,465
But the one to make
the first move would be…

332
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,721
<i>That's a heavy blow.</i>

333
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,316
<i>Fil has gotten a lot stronger</i>

334
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,652
<i>since we last dueled.</i>

335
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:34,572
<i>That hit could've seriously taken me out.</i>

336
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,033
Lady Fil is strong.

337
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,993
They may be the vigilante corps,

338
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,871
but the members are mostly
young people who've never left.

339
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,999
So, not everyone is as skilled in combat.

340
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,085
But,

341
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,296
Miss Fil and Big Brother are exceptions.

342
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,968
They're better off
honing their skills in the big cities.

343
00:18:55,593 --> 00:18:56,803
I see.

344
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,013
Get him, Fil!

345
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,307
We ought to take Rud down sometimes!

346
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,017
Master!

347
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,270
Please do your best!

348
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,646
Big Brother!

349
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,402
You can afford to look away?

350
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,030
<i>It grazed me, but it's not a big deal.</i>

351
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,949
<i>I can use this damage…</i>

352
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,703
Rud's off balance.

353
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,038
Fil, now's your chance!

354
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,042
What?

355
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,342
My shield force was wiped out.

356
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,178
Just from that one hit?

357
00:19:39,012 --> 00:19:42,348
Has that Rud finally learned
an attack skill?

358
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:45,518
Doesn't Fil have a shield force
of 2,500 or something?

359
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:48,521
To destroy it in one hit,
just how powerful is that skill?

360
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,023
You've gotten stronger.

361
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,901
Still not enough to beat you, though.

362
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:56,237
By the way,

363
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,406
what was that stupendous skill?

364
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,659
<i>It's called Life Conversion.</i>

365
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,119
<i>It allows me to turn</i>

366
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:05,747
<i>the shield force consumed in battle
into power.</i>

367
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,082
I can't use it anytime I want,

368
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,626
but thanks to this duel,

369
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:13,087
I now know how powerful it is.

370
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,006
Thanks.

371
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:17,467
Glad to be of help.

372
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:20,762
<i>As a tank,</i>

373
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,097
<i>I've always been concentrating on defense.</i>

374
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:24,807
<i>However,</i>

375
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,061
<i>thanks to this Life Conversion skill,</i>

376
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:31,064
<i>I'll be able to attack as well.</i>

377
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,274
All right. Who's next?

378
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,109
I just remembered I have an emergency…

379
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:37,362
I think I have a stomach ache.

380
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,405
Master was incredible.

381
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:40,823
Yes.

382
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,867
Big Brother is amazing.

383
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:46,037
Compared to him, I…

384
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,166
Mama… Papa…

385
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,626
Big Brother…

386
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,503
Where are you?

387
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:56,714
It looks like that girl's been abandoned.

388
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,508
I heard she has an incurable disease.

389
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:01,803
Seems her parents are only
willing to keep their son, Rud.

390
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,847
I saw them drag him away.

391
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,520
From the looks of it, she won't last long.

392
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:15,191
Manicia!

393
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,239
Thank goodness! So this is where you were.

394
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,366
<i>Big Brother!</i>

395
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,707
<i>It's that dream again.</i>

396
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,962
<i>Big Brother always came back for me.</i>

397
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:41,426
<i>But is he really happy like this?</i>

398
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,388
<i>If it weren't for me,</i>

399
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:51,185
<i>he would be able to live more freely,
wouldn't he?</i>
