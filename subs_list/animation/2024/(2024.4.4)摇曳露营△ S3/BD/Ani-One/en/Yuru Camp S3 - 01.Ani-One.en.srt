TOEI STATION

TOEI, KITASHITARA DISTRICT,
AICHI PREFECTURE

3
00:00:28,005 --> 00:00:29,600
You've come a long way, Rin.

4
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,501
Is there anywhere you want to visit?

5
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:36,308
The dam.

6
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:37,813
The dam?

7
00:00:41,603 --> 00:00:42,714
The dam it is.

8
00:00:51,308 --> 00:00:52,813
ELEMENTARY 4TH GRADE SOCIAL STUDIES

9
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,719
WHERE DOES THE WATER FLOW?

10
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:11,195
Looks like we came at the right time.

11
00:01:15,802 --> 00:01:16,910
Come here.

12
00:01:33,308 --> 00:01:34,402
Is it scary?

13
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:36,209
A little.

14
00:01:40,505 --> 00:01:42,495
But it's fascinating.

15
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:44,521
I see.

16
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,209
Welcome.

00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:51,490
INABU CASTELLA, MATCHA, BLACK RICE

to include in your journal?

INABU LOCAL SPECIALITIES

20
00:02:03,402 --> 00:02:04,813
"INABU ONSEN, INABU WORKSHOP"
Thank you for your purchase.

21
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:07,710
All right. Let's head back to my place.

22
00:02:21,495 --> 00:02:23,313
These are camping supplies.

23
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:25,995
Camping?

24
00:02:38,302 --> 00:02:42,302
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

25
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,913
EPISODE ONE: WHERE ARE WE GOING NEXT?

26
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:09,288
LAKE SHOJIKO

27
00:04:35,897 --> 00:04:39,704
Doesn't that little mountain
look like a small child?

28
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:43,403
Because it looks like Mount Fuji
holding a child in its arms,

29
00:04:43,403 --> 00:04:45,799
this scene is called "Kodakifuji"
(Fuji cradling a child).

30
00:04:46,702 --> 00:04:47,892
You're right.

31
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:49,194
It does look like
Mount Fuji's holding a child.

32
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:52,205
And the only lake where you can see
the inverted Fuji cradling a child

33
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:53,292
is Lake Shojiko.

34
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,694
Inverted Fuji?

35
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,413
Yes.

36
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:58,007
But now there are ripples
on the lake surface, so you can't see it.

37
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,002
Anyway,
this is your reserved camping site.

38
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:03,804
Okay.

39
00:05:05,397 --> 00:05:06,397
All right.

40
00:05:19,095 --> 00:05:20,501
I'm good at pitching tents now.

41
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:29,195
The tent I got from Grandpa

42
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,006
is getting a bit old.

43
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:37,211
So, all of those are Grandpa's?

44
00:05:37,696 --> 00:05:39,502
Do you want to try camping?

45
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,012
Camping?

46
00:05:42,106 --> 00:05:43,903
Camping is that thing, right?

47
00:05:43,903 --> 00:05:45,122
I've seen it on TV before.

48
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,898
Just do this
and you can start a fire, right?

49
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,299
Or was that a movie?

50
00:05:52,007 --> 00:05:53,794
They rub their hands like this
and smoke comes out.

51
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:56,210
Grandpa, can you do that too?

52
00:05:57,006 --> 00:05:59,606
Um, that's a little…

53
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:01,193
You can't?

54
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:06,001
All right.

55
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:10,611
What's the matter?

56
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:16,658
TSUGU PARK

57
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,298
Cold?

58
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:23,600
No.

59
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:35,101
Hello!

60
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:43,512
Grandpa, isn't this how you do it?

61
00:06:46,798 --> 00:06:48,991
You can do it that way,

62
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,903
but I want to show you another way.

63
00:06:51,905 --> 00:06:52,810
Don't worry.

64
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,705
This will make a fire too.

65
00:06:58,299 --> 00:07:00,106
I've never tried this way, though.

66
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:05,195
Until that day,

67
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:07,397
I always thought Grandpa was a scary man,

68
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:09,105
so I didn't know
how to get along with him.

69
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,894
Maybe I should try that.

70
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:28,507
This is how you do it, right?

71
00:07:34,095 --> 00:07:34,995
It's smoking!

72
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:36,898
Hot!

73
00:07:55,297 --> 00:07:56,210
It's lit.

74
00:08:00,908 --> 00:08:02,022
That's amazing!

75
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,116
Should we heat up the milk we just bought

76
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,512
to make some hot milk?

77
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,408
I think…

78
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:15,794
I made Grandpa

79
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,299
do something absurd

80
00:08:22,907 --> 00:08:25,413
and impossible.

81
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:37,611
It's smoking!

82
00:08:42,387 --> 00:08:44,204
Just a little more!

83
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,903
My arms are killing me…

84
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,106
There's smoke,

85
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:55,705
but it just won't catch fire at all.

86
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:00,002
I did it!

87
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,604
That's amazing!

88
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:32,112
Ready…

89
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:38,304
Be careful, it's hot.

90
00:09:47,902 --> 00:09:49,601
It's nice and warm.

91
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:51,007
All right.

92
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,403
Let's take this cup of milk

93
00:09:52,403 --> 00:09:54,012
and head to my secret spot.

94
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,700
Miss,

95
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,700
you went through all that work
to start a fire.

96
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,507
But why did you use this to cook?

97
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:10,799
If you cook with an open fire,

98
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,903
the charcoal will make the pot turn black.

99
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:16,111
Hana-chan, it's time to go!

100
00:10:21,106 --> 00:10:23,512
I don't want to go home yet.

101
00:10:23,512 --> 00:10:26,002
Come on. Your dad's waiting in the car.

102
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,799
No, I want to stay.

103
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:29,710
Now, now...

104
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:36,502
It's a nice view, isn't it?

105
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,502
Yum.

106
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:48,700
Want another?

107
00:10:49,793 --> 00:10:50,600
Can I have it?

108
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,902
Yes, I'm full.

109
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,309
INABU OBSERVATION POINT

110
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:02,002
Let's pack up after you finish your snack.

111
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:08,194
Don't make that face.

112
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:12,013
Loneliness always accompanies camping.

113
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,903
And it's this loneliness
that makes us look forward

114
00:11:14,903 --> 00:11:17,301
to the next camping trip.

115
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:22,106
SCENIC LOOKOUT ROUTE

116
00:11:22,106 --> 00:11:23,908
We can go on another trip another day.

117
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,898
I always feel

118
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:36,700
a bit lonely at the end of each trip.

119
00:11:40,903 --> 00:11:42,000
But

120
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,408
I don't dislike that feeling.

121
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,392
After all, I can just go on another trip

122
00:11:47,793 --> 00:11:48,707
somewhere else, another day.

123
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,505
But still,

124
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,200
I can't help feeling a bit lonely

125
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:03,611
because of how much fun we've had
over these past few days.

126
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:08,200
It's this loneliness
that makes us look forward

127
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:12,210
to the next camping trip, huh?

128
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:18,512
Nadeshiko, where should we go next time?

129
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:25,528
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES CLUB

130
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:32,209
It's been a while
since we've hung out together after school.

131
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,788
It's because
we've all been so busy with work.

132
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:36,611
Exactly!

133
00:12:38,595 --> 00:12:40,903
We've been working too hard.

134
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:44,304
The money we got from our part-time jobs

135
00:12:44,304 --> 00:12:46,309
did let us buy the camping chairs
and go on that luxurious Izu Camp, though.

136
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,194
And lots of souvenirs.

137
00:12:49,194 --> 00:12:51,012
That was a fun trip.

138
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:52,398
But

139
00:12:52,398 --> 00:12:54,492
have you forgotten what we set out to do?

140
00:12:56,689 --> 00:12:58,111
Even without spending any money,

141
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,106
we've come up with lots of things
with our brilliant minds and trial and error!

142
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:03,803
But

143
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:06,002
the makeshift bed was a failure.

144
00:13:06,204 --> 00:13:07,897
Shh, let's not bring that up.

145
00:13:08,293 --> 00:13:09,293
Therefore,

146
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:11,100
for this long-awaited after-school
Outdoor Activities Club meeting,

147
00:13:11,897 --> 00:13:13,309
"PREMIUM CAFÉ AU LAIT"
we will be having this!

148
00:13:13,309 --> 00:13:14,387
Drink up.

149
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:15,919
Thanks.

150
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,200
Is this your treat?

151
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:25,898
We're going to make
alcohol stoves with these!

152
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,491
That's an alcohol lamp.

153
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:33,311
Alcohol stove.

154
00:13:33,902 --> 00:13:36,012
A type of portable stove
that uses alcohol as fuel

155
00:13:36,012 --> 00:13:38,694
and is extremely lightweight.

156
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,897
Typically used
when mountain climbing or solo camping.

157
00:13:41,898 --> 00:13:43,194
It can be used to boil water

158
00:13:43,194 --> 00:13:45,392
or cook simple meals.

159
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:47,403
Because of its simple construction,

160
00:13:47,403 --> 00:13:50,111
it can also be made using empty cans.

161
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,600
I've read about it in outdoor magazines.

162
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,403
I didn't know you can make one yourself.

163
00:13:58,111 --> 00:13:58,647
Gleam!

164
00:13:58,648 --> 00:14:00,004
DISCARD THIS PART, MAKE A CUT HERE

165
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,792
"USE A COMPASS KNIFE, USE AN AWL"
Here's how you make it.

166
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:03,194
"ROLL UP AND INSERT, AND DONE"
Cut the can in half,

167
00:14:03,194 --> 00:14:04,001
punch some holes,

168
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:05,705
and stick it all together.

169
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:07,403
You make it sound so simple.

170
00:14:08,017 --> 00:14:09,902
That's all there is to it!

171
00:14:10,606 --> 00:14:11,413
"FIZZY GRAPE DRINK"
Incidentally,

172
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:13,397
when using aluminium cans as materials,

173
00:14:13,398 --> 00:14:17,408
avoid using ones with labels
directly printed on the can.

174
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:21,109
Choosing cans with stick-on labels

175
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,496
will yield better results.

176
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:25,205
Maybe we can make

177
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:28,492
a long-burning alcohol stove
if we use longer cans!

178
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,205
That sounds dangerous.
Just follow the instructions.

179
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:35,596
And so, they got right to it.

180
00:14:37,188 --> 00:14:39,605
Wrap masking tape around the can,
then gently cut along the edges

181
00:14:39,606 --> 00:14:43,002
with a knife repeatedly.

182
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:44,609
That will give you nice, clean cuts.

183
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,897
I see.

184
00:14:46,507 --> 00:14:47,475
FIRST CAN

185
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,012
SECOND CAN

186
00:14:53,491 --> 00:14:54,481
THIRD CAN

187
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:03,216
No matter what I do,
it always caves in when I cut it!

188
00:15:05,598 --> 00:15:07,496
We just started...

189
00:15:07,497 --> 00:15:09,596
Nadeshiko's using too much force.

190
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:11,601
In that case...

191
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,309
"GRAPE MILK"
I'll use a steel can!

192
00:15:18,392 --> 00:15:20,502
This time it won't cut at all!

193
00:15:20,913 --> 00:15:22,199
Sheesh!

194
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:24,502
"HACKSAW"
I'll use this hacksaw

195
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:26,002
and saw it in half!

196
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:29,715
She's really full of energy.

197
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,097
By the way, Aki,

198
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,908
your hair's gotten pretty long, huh?

199
00:15:35,391 --> 00:15:37,309
Now that you mention it,
it is kind of long.

200
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,496
Well, it's been a while
since I got a haircut.

201
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:42,897
AKI-CHAN

202
00:15:42,898 --> 00:15:46,710
The exposed forehead's more Aki's style.

203
00:15:47,111 --> 00:15:48,299
True.

204
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:50,205
Should I put it up like this?

205
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:51,908
That makes you look like my sister.

206
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:55,095
Her hair used to be shoulder-length.

207
00:15:56,197 --> 00:15:57,197
Is that so?

208
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,590
My hair's been a pain

209
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,808
on our recent camping trips.

210
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:04,419
Maybe it's time to cut it short?

211
00:16:04,793 --> 00:16:07,105
Shall I cut it for you, then?

212
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:08,596
Ena.

213
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:10,699
What are you guys making?

214
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,387
We're making alcohol stoves.

215
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:17,507
Ena, you know how to cut hair?

216
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:20,194
You could say that.

217
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,507
I cut Chikuwa's fur.

218
00:16:23,507 --> 00:16:24,611
Oh, Chikuwa.

219
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:26,693
Don't worry.

220
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,913
I cut my own hair too.

221
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:30,399
I can totally help you with yours.

222
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,893
Really?

223
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:33,403
Speaking of a haircut,

224
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:35,702
I just had a thought!

225
00:16:35,702 --> 00:16:38,507
Wouldn't it be nice to get your hair cut
while you're out camping?

226
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:42,111
The wide open space at the camping site

227
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:44,903
would feel nice, wouldn't it?

228
00:16:45,701 --> 00:16:48,199
That does sound pretty nice!

229
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,997
Right?

230
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:50,092
No, no, no…

231
00:16:50,503 --> 00:16:52,882
The slightest breeze will get
the hair everywhere.

232
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:54,398
That's not going to work.

233
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:57,210
Oh, right.

234
00:16:57,596 --> 00:17:00,189
In that case,
why don't we do it in my yard?

235
00:17:00,189 --> 00:17:01,603
Can we?

236
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,892
If we'll all be there,
why don't we make it a yard camp?

237
00:17:04,397 --> 00:17:06,496
Camping in a yard? Yard camp?

238
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,884
Yard camp and day camp.

239
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:11,017
Day yard camp.

240
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,198
A day yard camp!

241
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:21,408
Then, just carefully insert
the bottom half into the top half...

242
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:24,007
"DIY ALCOHOL STOVE"
DIY alcohol stove

243
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,710
complete!

244
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:31,002
As expected of a steel can.
Nadeshiko's alcohol stove is sturdy.

245
00:17:31,002 --> 00:17:31,898
Right?

246
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,293
I polished the outer layer too.

247
00:17:35,293 --> 00:17:37,805
You can't tell it used
to be a juice can at all.

248
00:17:39,002 --> 00:17:40,798
You did well.

249
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:44,700
Now, let's get Ms. Toba here
and start experimenting!

250
00:17:46,116 --> 00:17:48,111
SCIENCE CLASSROOM

251
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,205
Oh, you girls made alcohol stoves.

252
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,613
We want

253
00:17:53,613 --> 00:17:54,906
to put alcohol in them

254
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,909
and see if they work.

255
00:17:58,404 --> 00:17:59,611
I understand.

256
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,710
Let's try it.

257
00:18:02,491 --> 00:18:04,012
"ANHYDROUS ALCOHOL, 1000 YEN"
The main fuels

258
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:05,496
"ETHANOL FUEL, 300 YEN"
used in alcohol stoves

259
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:10,098
are anhydrous alcohol and ethanol fuel.

260
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,203
Both can be purchased at drugstores.

261
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,702
Additionally,

262
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:20,198
although high-proof alcohol
can be used as fuel...

263
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,203
That's too wasteful!

264
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:24,000
As such, it is not recommended.

265
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:29,810
How much fuel you put in the alcohol stove
determines how long it burns,

266
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:31,198
so I'll only pour a little bit.

267
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:35,995
This is just like a science experiment!

268
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:38,995
Okay, I'm lighting them up!

269
00:18:45,507 --> 00:18:47,510
Huh, are they really lit?

270
00:18:48,505 --> 00:18:50,505
I did hear a sound just now.

271
00:18:52,104 --> 00:18:53,500
They're lit.

272
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:56,400
But the flames
are not that noticeable at first.

273
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:58,510
You're right!

274
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,807
They are burning!

275
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:02,406
The sunlight outshines the flames.

276
00:19:03,198 --> 00:19:04,499
Take a good look.

277
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,312
As the heat from the flame warms up
the alcohol stoves,

278
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,198
the fuel will continuously vaporise.

279
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,487
It's so pretty!

280
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:20,197
The holes you make affect
the shape of the flame,

281
00:19:20,198 --> 00:19:22,609
so with practice, you can make
some impressive alcohol stoves.

282
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,900
Like works of art.

283
00:19:25,803 --> 00:19:29,001
Ms. Toba, you seem to know
a lot about alcohol stoves.

284
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,312
I've made some before myself.

285
00:19:32,994 --> 00:19:33,796
Um...

286
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,301
I hate to say this after all
the effort you put into making these,

287
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:38,515
but

288
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:41,416
I would advise against
using alcohol stoves.

289
00:19:42,002 --> 00:19:43,598
But why?

290
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:48,011
If you put it on grass
and accidentally knock it over,

291
00:19:49,493 --> 00:19:51,499
the fire could spread quickly,
and that can be very dangerous.

292
00:19:52,993 --> 00:19:56,403
You also need to be careful
when storing and transporting the fuel.

293
00:19:59,506 --> 00:20:01,500
If you're planning on
using alcohol stoves,

294
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:04,093
make sure to store the fuel
in specialised containers.

295
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:06,604
And be sure to use it on ground
where it won't catch fire if spilled.

296
00:20:07,085 --> 00:20:10,813
Also, be careful not to place
flammable materials nearby.

297
00:20:11,098 --> 00:20:12,400
Got it.

298
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,293
Next time, we'll be at Ena's place
for some day yard camping!

299
00:20:21,907 --> 00:20:23,402
Yard camping and day camping,

300
00:20:23,403 --> 00:20:25,106
they're both firsts for me.

301
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,501
It's been a while since I've seen Chikuwa.
I'm really looking forward to it.

302
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:32,600
I've got all of
Chikuwa's camping equipment ready to go.

303
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,704
I'll show you guys all of them.

304
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:36,204
Please do!

305
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,298
Since we have this opportunity,

306
00:20:40,298 --> 00:20:43,105
how about trying to cook something
with the alcohol stove?

307
00:20:43,495 --> 00:20:44,600
Sounds good.

308
00:20:45,305 --> 00:20:47,412
The flames aren't that strong.

309
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,408
We should grill up some sausages.

310
00:20:49,689 --> 00:20:50,790
Good idea.

311
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:53,694
Izu Camp was fun,

312
00:20:53,694 --> 00:20:55,712
but I'm excited for this day camp!

313
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,896
Yard camp and day camp and sausage camp.

314
00:21:05,286 --> 00:21:07,890
Put it together and you get
"yard day sausage camp".

315
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:09,401
You don't have to call it that.

316
00:21:18,198 --> 00:21:19,698
Nadeshiko!

317
00:21:20,595 --> 00:21:22,405
The flowers aren't in bloom yet.

318
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:23,709
What were you taking a photo of?

319
00:21:27,795 --> 00:21:29,694
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

320
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:13,912
It's been a while, Rin.

321
00:23:17,282 --> 00:23:18,382
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, RIN

322
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:19,501
SORRY, BUT WHO IS THIS?

323
00:23:19,996 --> 00:23:22,902
Oh, sorry. It's Ayano. Send!

324
00:23:27,754 --> 00:23:36,252
NEXT EPISODE: PETIT CAMP AND YARD CAMP

325
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:36,987
WHEN ENJOYING CAMPING,

326
00:23:36,988 --> 00:23:37,606
BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RULES
OF THE CAMPGROUND AND ITS FACILITIES.

327
00:23:37,607 --> 00:23:38,606
DON'T FORGET TO PUT OUT YOUR CAMPFIRE
AND DISPOSE OF YOUR GARBAGE.

328
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:39,213
TEMPERATURES CAN CHANGE QUICKLY,

329
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:39,903
SO CHECK THE WEATHER FORECAST BEFOREHAND.

330
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:41,101
WEAR WARM CLOTHING IF NECESSARY
TO PREVENT COLD.
