1
00:00:09,995 --> 00:00:12,108
It smells so good!

2
00:00:12,109 --> 00:00:14,343
I wish I could eat it straight away.

3
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,385
Good morning!

4
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:30,865
Good morning.

5
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,318
Want some breakfast, Rin?

6
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,999
Canapé.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,770
A type of bread sliced thinly
and toasted until crispy,

8
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:44,754
then spread with cream cheese,
topped with ham,

9
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:47,838
and drizzled with olive oil.

10
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,799
And there you have it,

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,703
"HAM AND CREAM CHEESE CANAPÉ"
ham and cream cheese canapé.

12
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:57,396
It's delicious!

13
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:02,151
Can't believe we're indulging
in such luxury so early in the morning.

14
00:01:02,152 --> 00:01:03,901
Can I have another?

15
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,524
Help yourself!

16
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:13,108
You mentioned a famous suspension bridge
in Sumatakyo.

17
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:14,702
You mean
the Yume (Dream) Suspension Bridge?

18
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:16,598
Suspension bridge…

19
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:18,400
If you want to go there,

20
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:19,906
you'll have to catch
the bus that comes in an hour.

21
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,004
If you miss it,

22
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:23,088
you won't be able to go.

23
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:26,697
The bus an hour from now?

24
00:01:26,698 --> 00:01:28,098
No problem…

25
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:31,416
It's a 39-minute walk to the bus stop.

26
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:36,129
We'll take care of the clean-up.

27
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,614
Thank you very much.

28
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:41,464
Even at a time like this,
you're still a glutton.

29
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:59,185
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

30
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:19,323
EPISODE 6: SEE YOU AGAIN

31
00:03:32,193 --> 00:03:33,499
"WELCOME TO SUMATAKYO HOT SPRINGS"
The bike girls.

32
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,504
It's about 11 kilometres from the campsite
to the suspension bridge.

33
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:37,697
Sumatakyo.

34
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,296
We're here!

35
00:03:39,297 --> 00:03:40,801
There was an uphill climb,

36
00:03:40,802 --> 00:03:43,004
but the roads were nice
and made it a pretty smooth ride.

37
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:45,911
Well, this is a popular tourist area.

38
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:48,978
SUMATA VILLAGE

39
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,156
MOTORCYCLE PARKING, 200 YEN EACH
PLEASE PUT THE MONEY IN THE CAN, THANK YOU

40
00:03:51,157 --> 00:03:52,905
Excuse me.

41
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:55,494
We'd like to park our bikes outside.

42
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:57,500
Go right ahead.

43
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:12,010
The sight of cats and dogs

44
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:13,604
basking in the sun is truly healing.

45
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:14,802
I can relate.

46
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:22,692
PICKLES, WILD VEGETABLES, SUMATAKYO TOUR

47
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:24,096
How free-spirited.

48
00:04:24,805 --> 00:04:27,296
By the way, where is Nadeshiko?

49
00:04:27,297 --> 00:04:30,894
We agreed to meet
in front of the guesthouse.

50
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,521
She's over there, Aya.

51
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:38,041
This potato mochi is so good!
It's soft and gooey!

52
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:40,910
She's already eating.

53
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:42,614
She's a free-spirited one too.

54
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,374
After successfully meeting up,

55
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:50,192
they headed to the most famous
suspension bridge in Oigawa.

56
00:04:50,193 --> 00:04:51,422
Let's go!

57
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:54,306
However, just as they were about to leave,

58
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:56,499
their attention was caught
by a foot bath café.

59
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,905
I'm surprised there's a café here.

60
00:04:58,906 --> 00:05:00,567
Foot bath café.

61
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:05,306
The gelato is great!

62
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:07,203
The cheesecake's delicious too.

63
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:11,921
The foot bath is so relaxing.

64
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:15,198
Put your hands in
and you'll feel even warmer.

65
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,405
So warm…

66
00:05:17,406 --> 00:05:19,610
It's cold today.

67
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:27,369
I want to soak my whole body in it.

68
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,369
Stop that line of thought.

69
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,912
This isn't the place for that.

70
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:32,789
Huh? Aren't you the girl from the train?

71
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,802
Oh? It's you ladies!

72
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:39,301
These are the ladies who sat next to me
on the ABT train.

73
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:41,103
Hello.

74
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:43,505
We even saw the clink-clink.

75
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:45,396
Clink-clink?

76
00:05:47,605 --> 00:05:50,014
So you guys stayed in Sumatakyo?

77
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:51,020
Yeah.

78
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:53,395
How was camping in Ichishiro?

79
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,697
It was so much fun!

80
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:58,004
Are you two also heading
to the Dream Suspension Bridge?

81
00:05:58,005 --> 00:06:00,103
We're heading home now.

82
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:02,203
We checked out
the suspension bridge yesterday.

83
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:06,406
We went for a walk in Ikawa
and only arrived here in the evening.

84
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:08,703
All right. To the suspension bridge we go!

85
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:14,183
The sun was already setting when
she mentioned wanting to go to the bridge.

86
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:18,603
We ended up halfway when the sun set.

87
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:19,697
We had to rely on our phones' flashlights

88
00:06:19,698 --> 00:06:23,208
to make our way back in the dark.

89
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:29,387
There wasn't a single street lamp
to be found.

90
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,489
You guys were lucky
you didn't encounter any bears.

91
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,619
But the view

92
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,311
from the suspension bridge was beautiful.
So, it was all worth it.

93
00:06:37,102 --> 00:06:38,605
I'm really looking forward to it!

94
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,499
Then let's finish up…

95
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,692
and head out!

96
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,696
You girls take care of yourselves.

97
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,615
We will.

98
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:51,099
YUME SUSPENSION BRIDGE BEAUTY SPRING

99
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,703
YUME SUSPENSION BRIDGE, HIRYU BRIDGE
MT. KUROHOSHI ENTRANCE

100
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,604
PLEASE USE THESE WALKING STICKS

101
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:05,307
Duel at Ganryu Island.

102
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,091
You know,

103
00:07:07,092 --> 00:07:10,302
you really have a knack
for making friends with anyone, Nadeshiko.

104
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:11,796
Absolutely…

105
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,707
Really?

106
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,191
Well, you're like a puppy.

107
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:19,493
Likes everyone. Loves walks.

108
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:20,395
Totally.

109
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:23,191
Come to think of it,

110
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:26,410
back when I was in Year 1 or 2,

111
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,640
I remember going shopping
with Nadeshiko's family once.

112
00:07:30,094 --> 00:07:33,103
Nadeshiko disappeared out of the blue.

113
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:34,697
Oh no, where's Nadeshiko?

114
00:07:34,698 --> 00:07:36,092
Did she get lost?

115
00:07:36,093 --> 00:07:37,400
Who's that kid?

116
00:07:37,401 --> 00:07:38,172
Found her.

117
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:42,599
When we found her at last, she was playing
with some kid from another family.

118
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,707
Did that really happen?

119
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:47,993
It's probably because something like that
has happened too many times

120
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:51,390
that Sakura-san keeps such a close eye
on Nadeshiko all the time.

121
00:07:52,179 --> 00:07:53,895
Sarunami Bridge.

122
00:07:54,682 --> 00:08:00,202
It is said that it is named so because
the monkeys that live in the mountains

123
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:01,522
use this bridge to go
to the Sumatakyo Hot Spring.

124
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,384
So the monkeys here actually
soak in hot springs?

125
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,452
Maybe.

126
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,437
That's a therapeutic image.

127
00:08:10,608 --> 00:08:12,108
It's a monkey!

128
00:08:12,109 --> 00:08:13,510
Oh, you're right.

129
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,104
We can see the Yume Suspension Bridge!

130
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:23,984
Finally!

131
00:08:24,806 --> 00:08:26,511
Yume Suspension Bridge.

132
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:29,910
The bridge only allows one-way traffic,

133
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:32,691
so after crossing, we have to take
a big detour to come back.

134
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:35,499
There really aren't many tourists
when you avoid peak times.

135
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,500
We can take our time to cross it.
That's great.

136
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:45,993
The river is such a beautiful colour.

137
00:08:45,994 --> 00:08:49,806
But it's still scary to look down.

138
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,296
It's 8 metres high.

139
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:55,406
And it sways a lot
when you reach the middle…!

140
00:08:56,895 --> 00:08:58,603
Aren't you guys scared at all?

141
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,998
Well,

142
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:04,113
we survived the bridge of death.

143
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:05,708
This is a piece of cake.

144
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,191
Oh, right.

145
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:08,999
I looked it up yesterday.

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,937
There's a suspension bridge
in the mountains here

147
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:12,499
that's even scarier than Hatanagi.

148
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,691
What? That suspension bridge
wasn't the craziest?

149
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:18,311
"MUSOU SUSPENSION BRIDGE"
With a total length of 144 metres

150
00:09:18,312 --> 00:09:20,681
and a height of 83 metres,

151
00:09:20,682 --> 00:09:22,993
it was initially built
for the convenience of forestry work,

152
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:26,181
but it's now widely known as
Japan's scariest suspension bridge.

153
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:28,098
83 metres?

154
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:30,500
Doesn't that make it three times taller
than the Hatanagi Suspension Bridge?

155
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:34,009
And that bridge's deteriorating.

156
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:36,702
It could collapse at any moment.

157
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:39,098
Sounds like some sort
of Russian roulette suspension bridge!

158
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:43,206
Due to severe damage,
the Musou Suspension Bridge

159
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,500
is no longer accessible.

160
00:09:46,011 --> 00:09:47,838
Oh, is that a dam over there?

161
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:50,588
It seems like it.

162
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,181
We did pass by what looked like

163
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:53,894
an administrative building
on the way here.

164
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:55,593
Yeah, we did.

165
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:59,598
Nagashima, Ikawa, Hatanagi.

166
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,410
We've crossed many suspension bridges

167
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:03,203
and dams.

168
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:04,895
We did.

169
00:10:05,604 --> 00:10:07,703
So that's Oma Dam.

170
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:13,639
That was close!

171
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,197
That was scary!

172
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,504
Better not use your phone
while on the bridge,

173
00:10:17,505 --> 00:10:18,905
or you might just fall into the river.

174
00:10:18,906 --> 00:10:20,207
You're right.

175
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:21,707
The river must be filled

176
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:28,317
with phones from all the people who were
too distracted trying to get "the shot".

177
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:31,400
Not exactly eco-friendly…

178
00:10:34,599 --> 00:10:35,593
Smile!

179
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:41,213
What kind of pose is this?

180
00:10:42,192 --> 00:10:43,703
We got off the suspension bridge,

181
00:10:43,704 --> 00:10:46,060
but I still can't feel my legs.

182
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:47,510
I feel you…

183
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:50,077
TAKE YOUR TIME AND REST AS YOU GO
TOTAL: 340 STEPS

184
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:00,702
You can do it, Aya!

185
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,104
You got this.

186
00:11:03,907 --> 00:11:07,103
Is this what they call
a miracle in times of crisis?

187
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:11,005
Never expected to find ourselves
climbing up a mountain out of nowhere.

188
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:15,493
After all that walking,

189
00:11:15,494 --> 00:11:16,706
it was time for some lunch.

190
00:11:16,707 --> 00:11:18,697
"YAMASASA SOBA, MATSUZAKE HONTEN"
Welcome.

191
00:11:18,698 --> 00:11:20,910
Anything you'd recommend?

192
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:22,493
The stream soba

193
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:23,707
is our signature dish.

194
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:24,708
Then I'll go with that.

195
00:11:24,709 --> 00:11:26,410
Me too.

196
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:27,635
I'll have the same.

197
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,005
Stream soba is delicious!

198
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:41,041
THE BATH IS OPEN TODAY

199
00:11:43,092 --> 00:11:46,795
Nothing beats soaking in a hot spring
after all that walking.

200
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,592
Right.

201
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:51,004
This is bliss…

202
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:55,087
This Beauty Spring is said
to have amazing skincare effects.

203
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:59,426
Rumour has it that anyone
who bathes here turns into a beauty.

204
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,333
A while ago, a group of middle-aged men
on a biking trip

205
00:12:01,334 --> 00:12:03,499
stopped to soak in the hot spring.

206
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,809
After they came out,
they all turned into beauties.

207
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:10,015
What kind of transformative
hot spring is that?

208
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:14,801
What's the plan after this, Aya?

209
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,401
Going to Senzu to buy souvenirs

210
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:19,738
and then head to see
the last suspension bridge.

211
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,692
Guess this trip is coming to an end.

212
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:25,499
I half-soloed this trip,

213
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,900
so it felt very different.

214
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:30,417
But having the chance to relax
and take my time was really nice.

215
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,592
I'm feeling pretty exhausted though.

216
00:12:33,593 --> 00:12:36,394
That's because you chose
the more challenging path.

217
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:39,405
SUMATAKYO HOT SPRING BUS STOP

218
00:12:39,406 --> 00:12:41,603
We'll see you in Senzu.

219
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:44,208
Drive safely.

220
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:49,809
Let's go, then.

221
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,088
Let's.

222
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:55,202
You take care too.

223
00:12:57,609 --> 00:12:59,197
In mid-March,

224
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:01,900
even though it's early spring,
the weather remains chilly.

225
00:13:01,901 --> 00:13:03,514
Riding a bike during this time

226
00:13:03,515 --> 00:13:05,905
makes the cold wind feel
even more bone-chilling.

227
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:10,197
That's why bikers
eagerly anticipate taking detours

228
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:11,916
to hot springs during their travels.

229
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:14,411
I still feel warm.

230
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,493
After soaking in the hot spring,
their bodies feel warm and cosy.

231
00:13:18,494 --> 00:13:20,108
However, it's crucial to wait
until the body is thoroughly warmed up

232
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:22,394
and any redness has subsided before
drying off sweat and putting on clothes.

233
00:13:22,395 --> 00:13:25,806
If you get dressed immediately
after leaving the bath,

234
00:13:25,807 --> 00:13:27,888
the skin inside the clothes
will continue to sweat,

235
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:30,598
causing the body to cool down again.

236
00:13:31,502 --> 00:13:34,896
Ayano and Rin, who had just set off,

237
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,442
forgot about this…

238
00:13:38,494 --> 00:13:40,592
It's freezing!

239
00:13:40,593 --> 00:13:42,905
…and started shivering.

240
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:51,099
Rin, I see the last suspension bridge!

241
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:54,463
Rin! Aya!

242
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,702
SHIOGO SUSPENSION BRIDGE (KOI KANAHASHI)

243
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,208
Shiogo Suspension Bridge.

244
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:07,306
Woah!

245
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:10,306
This suspension bridge hangs right above
the residential area.

246
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:14,406
It's different from the suspension bridges
we walked on before.

247
00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:20,202
This one feels scarier
than the Yume Suspension Bridge.

248
00:14:20,203 --> 00:14:22,504
This suspension bridge
is 10 metres off the ground.

249
00:14:22,505 --> 00:14:25,000
About the same as Yume Suspension Bridge.

250
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:29,609
Whether the ground below is solid
or water also affects the scary factor.

251
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:33,999
After all, if you fall off the bridge

252
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,811
and there's water below,
you might still have a chance.

253
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:39,088
I see what you mean.

254
00:14:39,991 --> 00:14:44,307
But, the view from here is really nice.

255
00:14:46,192 --> 00:14:47,906
The scenery is pretty nice.

256
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:55,893
Hello.

257
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:57,312
Hello.

258
00:14:58,099 --> 00:14:59,197
I see.

259
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:01,049
The middle part
is built wider for the times

260
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,900
where two groups from opposite directions
are passing at the same time.

261
00:15:02,901 --> 00:15:04,802
Opposite directions…

262
00:15:06,201 --> 00:15:09,098
If someone had been coming
from the opposite direction

263
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:11,317
while we were crossing
Hatanagi Suspension Bridge…

264
00:15:14,905 --> 00:15:18,401
Hatanagi Suspension Bridge left you two
with some serious trauma, huh?

265
00:15:25,197 --> 00:15:27,796
Hey! It's dangerous
to run on the suspension bridge!

266
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,911
Kids really do fear nothing…

267
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:33,307
Turn back here.

268
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,410
"LOVE BELL"
If we keep going forward,

269
00:15:35,411 --> 00:15:37,185
it seems we'll reach a campsite ahead.

270
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:44,103
SAKURA

271
00:15:53,812 --> 00:15:56,208
Was… was that a steam train just now?

272
00:15:57,603 --> 00:16:01,406
I forgot to take a photo of it!

273
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,314
Okay.

274
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:06,912
I'll get my dad to photoshop one in.

275
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:08,194
"HERE"
Right here.

276
00:16:08,195 --> 00:16:10,794
You're really going to do that, Nadeshiko?

277
00:16:11,824 --> 00:16:13,011
So, it seems like there's a steam train

278
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:15,601
passing through Oigawa almost every day.

279
00:16:15,602 --> 00:16:16,720
I had no idea.

280
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:19,001
Even the regular trains are retro.

281
00:16:19,002 --> 00:16:20,602
"CLINK-CLINK"
You can also see steam trains

282
00:16:20,603 --> 00:16:21,699
"CLINK-CLINK"
and sightseeing trains.

283
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,900
Oigawa is truly a paradise
for train enthusiasts!

284
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,293
When did you become a train enthusiast?

285
00:16:28,294 --> 00:16:31,508
I'm not. It's just,
after riding the ABT train,

286
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:34,501
I'm starting to think
these retro-style trains are really cute.

287
00:16:34,502 --> 00:16:35,893
So I guess that sparked an interest.

288
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:36,518
Plus,

289
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,022
taking a train all the way to a campsite

290
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:40,340
is actually quite fun.

291
00:16:40,341 --> 00:16:42,791
If Rin is a bike camper,

292
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:46,086
I'm going to be a train camper.

293
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:47,985
Sounds good.

294
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:49,507
Does it?

295
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,597
Even though I'm looking forward
to moving to Yamanashi,

296
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,199
I won't have anyone I know there.

297
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,695
That makes me feel kind of lonely.

298
00:17:01,811 --> 00:17:03,006
Oh, come on.

299
00:17:03,007 --> 00:17:05,006
With your personality,

300
00:17:05,007 --> 00:17:06,798
you'll make new friends in no time.

301
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,596
Don't worry about it.

302
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:11,913
You think so?

303
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:16,006
-See? I was right.
-Oh, right!

304
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:19,309
-You already have a good friend.
-I should buy that on my way home…

305
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,199
All right, then…

306
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,262
Aya?

307
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:25,116
The train should be arriving soon.

308
00:17:25,117 --> 00:17:27,004
I should get going too.

309
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:33,601
We'll go camping together again… right?

310
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:37,616
Anytime.

311
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:40,107
After all, I'll be riding my bike.

312
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:44,199
If it's an invitation from you two,

313
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,132
I'll go wherever!

314
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:48,205
Aya…

315
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:51,575
"SHIOGO SUSPENSION BRIDGE"
Aya!

316
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:00,799
I really don't want to go home yet!

317
00:18:01,835 --> 00:18:04,298
"ZONE OF DESPAIR"
Just the thought of riding for two hours

318
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:07,465
on that seemingly endless
straight road back home

319
00:18:07,466 --> 00:18:10,194
drains all my energy!

320
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:13,991
Nadeshiko, I don't want to go home…

321
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:17,090
I remember going through that when I went
to Hamamatsu at the end of last year.

322
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:18,605
I completely understand how you feel.

323
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:20,465
"EMPTY YOUR MIND"
Riding continuously on flat ground

324
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,099
with the same scenery the entire way,

325
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,793
it's like a form of Zen meditation.

326
00:18:24,794 --> 00:18:25,705
Meditation?

327
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:26,590
I've got it!

328
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:29,308
Let's take on another suspension bridge!

329
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,903
Let's do it!

330
00:18:31,502 --> 00:18:33,001
Another?

331
00:18:33,002 --> 00:18:35,902
But we're already downstream.
There might not be any around here.

332
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,303
Don't worry.

333
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:40,869
I saw one yesterday on
the sightseeing sign at Kanaya Station.

334
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:43,106
HORAI BRIDGE

335
00:18:43,496 --> 00:18:44,997
Horai Bridge.

336
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,121
As the world's longest
wooden pedestrian bridge,

337
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:50,461
it has been certified
by the Guinness World Records.

338
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,986
It's a bit different
from a suspension bridge,

339
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:11,002
but it has its own charm.

340
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,205
All right. It's time to go home.

341
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,697
If I stay any longer,

342
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:20,241
it'll get dark,
and that's no good for driving.

343
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,116
Sorry for keeping you both for so long.

344
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:24,496
It's no big deal.

345
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:28,809
Aya, let's find some time soon
to go camping together again!

346
00:19:29,897 --> 00:19:32,496
Even if I can't do "soon",

347
00:19:32,497 --> 00:19:34,507
I'll go all the way to Yamanashi
to find you guys next time.

348
00:19:35,407 --> 00:19:36,293
Aya.

349
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:43,799
Until we see each other again.

350
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:47,299
Yes, yes…

351
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:52,815
Make sure you tell me when you reach home.

352
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,997
I'll be worried.

353
00:19:54,614 --> 00:19:55,803
Okay…

354
00:19:55,804 --> 00:19:59,518
And don't take the wrong train, Nadeshiko.

355
00:20:06,804 --> 00:20:08,496
It's 9 PM already?

356
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:09,997
I accidentally stayed out too late.

357
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:15,298
I'm home now. I'm exhausted…

358
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,018
Rin made it home too.

359
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,017
Glad to hear that.

360
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,709
I'll be home in another ten minutes.

361
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:25,605
I made it home too, barely hanging on
riding on National Route 1.

362
00:20:25,606 --> 00:20:26,788
Good, good.

363
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:32,096
After crossing this bridge, I'll be home.

364
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:35,314
And that will mark the end
of this camping trip.

365
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:57,210
But I'll always have these memories.

366
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,522
Where should we go next time?

367
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,918
I'm back.

368
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,143
Welcome home.

369
00:22:43,497 --> 00:22:45,674
Nadeshiko, you're back a bit late.

370
00:22:46,694 --> 00:22:48,011
Sorry.

371
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:50,397
I took a detour to Kakegawa
on my way back,

372
00:22:50,398 --> 00:22:51,815
so it took me a while.

373
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:53,709
Kakegawa?

374
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,116
"SUPER TASTY 100% BEEF HAMBURG STEAK"
I went to buy this.

375
00:22:56,117 --> 00:22:59,008
Because you said
you haven't had this in a while.

376
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:05,403
You can order that online, you know?

377
00:23:05,408 --> 00:23:07,705
Really?

378
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:10,787
Hold up!

379
00:23:10,788 --> 00:23:13,808
Have you guys
completely forgotten about us?

380
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,996
Long time no see! I'm Chiaki Ohgaki.

381
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,815
Hey, I can see you guys.

382
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:23,610
The next episode is finally going
to be about our camping misadventures!

383
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,507
Don't miss it!

384
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:36,301
NEXT EPISODE: TRUTH OR LIES,
REALITY OR FICTION, MEMORIES OF CAMPING

385
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:36,901
WHEN ENJOYING CAMPING,
BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RULES

386
00:23:36,902 --> 00:23:37,500
OF THE CAMPGROUND AND ITS FACILITIES.

387
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,796
DON'T FORGET TO PUT OUT YOUR CAMPFIRE
AND DISPOSE OF YOUR GARBAGE.

388
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,005
TEMPERATURES CAN CHANGE QUICKLY,
SO CHECK THE WEATHER FORECAST BEFOREHAND.

389
00:23:40,006 --> 00:23:41,099
WEAR WARM CLOTHING IF NECESSARY
TO PREVENT COLD.
