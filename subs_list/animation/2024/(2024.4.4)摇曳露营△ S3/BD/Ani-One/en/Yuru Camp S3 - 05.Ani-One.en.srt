1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,802
All set with the firewood.

2
00:00:07,803 --> 00:00:09,996
Bought it at the management office.

3
00:00:12,047 --> 00:00:14,204
BURN RESIDUE DISPOSAL AREA

4
00:00:14,909 --> 00:00:17,204
Found the burn residue disposal area too.

5
00:00:18,502 --> 00:00:20,412
Now to set up the campfire

6
00:00:23,396 --> 00:00:27,599
before they get here.

7
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:44,168
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

8
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:03,407
EPISODE 5: BONFIRE AND BEEF FEAST

9
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:06,098
Rin's campfire set!

10
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:06,709
YESTERDAY

11
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,896
I might be a bit late to the campsite,

12
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:12,005
so I'll leave this with you.

13
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:14,506
Thank you, Rin!

14
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,506
First, put the firewood on the fire pit.

15
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,308
The world heritage site,
Nirayama Reverberatory Furnaces.

16
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:24,594
Nope.

17
00:02:26,402 --> 00:02:28,501
Guess I'll have to chop
the firewood properly.

18
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:36,370
And then…

19
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,408
Be careful with the blade

20
00:02:39,408 --> 00:02:40,901
because it's very sharp.

21
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:45,298
I used to brute chop the wood by force,

22
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:48,604
but it's dangerous
and can break the blade.

23
00:02:48,605 --> 00:02:50,699
Now I use the batoning method.

24
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,648
Batoning?

25
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:54,406
Batoning is a method used

26
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:55,693
when chopping wood

27
00:02:55,693 --> 00:03:01,401
with a small knife or hatchet,
tools lighter and smaller than an axe.

28
00:03:01,402 --> 00:03:05,157
Strike the back of the blade
with a wooden stick to slowly split the wood.

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Good.

30
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:32,002
Some of these are really tough to crack.

31
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,402
Task complete.

32
00:03:58,797 --> 00:03:59,797
It's hot!

33
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:02,797
While waiting for the fire to grow,

34
00:04:02,797 --> 00:04:04,434
"AMAZAKE (SWEET RICE WINE)"
it's time for outdoor cooking experiment!

35
00:04:04,435 --> 00:04:05,682
"AMAZAKE (SWEET RICE WINE)"
part 2!

36
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:07,913
"EASY AMAZAKE COOKIE"
For today's experiment,

37
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:11,188
we will be making simple and easy
amazake cookies using a frying pan.

38
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:11,972
"INGREDIENTS"

39
00:04:11,973 --> 00:04:14,808
"40G UNSALTED BUTTER, 1 EGG YOLK"
First, melt the butter in the pan.

40
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:16,209
Let it cool

41
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:17,902
and the egg yolk, then mix well.

42
00:04:18,606 --> 00:04:20,797
This recipe doesn't call
for the egg white,

43
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:22,813
so let's fry it up
and eat it with some salt.

44
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:24,105
"INGREDIENTS: 5TBSP POWDERED AMAZAKE"
Next,

45
00:04:24,105 --> 00:04:26,281
"7TBSP RICE POWDER,"
put all the ingredients

46
00:04:26,282 --> 00:04:28,698
"10G CRUSHED ALMONDS, 1.5TBSP WATER"
into a freezer bag

47
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:31,103
and mix well.

48
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,307
Then, add the ingredients from the pan
into the bag and knead.

49
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,506
Then, scoop out a spoonfuls of the dough

50
00:04:38,506 --> 00:04:40,197
and flatten it into cookie shapes
in the frying pan.

51
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:43,192
Cook it over low heat to avoid burning.

52
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:46,094
Once one side is cooked,
flip it over to cook the other side.

53
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:49,308
Finally, set it aside to cool
and for the fat to solidify.

54
00:04:49,308 --> 00:04:51,318
And it's done!

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,104
Not only is it easy to make,

56
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:04,402
but it's also great to make
at a group camp.

57
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:06,401
This

58
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:09,104
tastes like the crust of a melon bread.

59
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,813
Though it takes some effort,

60
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:19,563
who would've thought you could make
melon bread using just a frying pan?

61
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:21,500
If I can make it during a group camp…

62
00:05:21,505 --> 00:05:23,140
"You're amazing, Nadeshiko!"

63
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,000
Everyone will probably praise me.

64
00:05:43,297 --> 00:05:45,511
It's so peaceful here.

65
00:05:46,193 --> 00:05:49,209
Must be fun to play in the river here
during summer.

66
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,594
Those ladies mentioned the train needed
to be linked before it goes up a slope.

67
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:57,907
That must be the slope.

68
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,995
It's really something,
driving through such terrain.

69
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:16,907
Brr, it's chilly.

70
00:06:17,809 --> 00:06:22,209
I feel like getting one of those
camping chairs everyone has.

71
00:06:31,905 --> 00:06:32,905
Aya…

72
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,812
Come on, Nadeshiko, don't cry.

73
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:40,203
We can still keep in touch
whenever we want.

74
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,208
Aya,

75
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,432
I promise I'll come back to visit
during winter break!

76
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,098
Got it.

77
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:51,702
And I'll definitely swing
by your place too.

78
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:54,494
Take care of yourself.

79
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:55,999
Aya…

80
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,593
Rin and Aya hanging out together,

81
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:03,301
hard to believe they'd get along so well.

82
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:12,509
It takes about two hours
to get from Hatanagi to here.

83
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,213
They should be almost here.

84
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:17,999
Hatanagi Dam.

85
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,904
Dam?

86
00:07:19,905 --> 00:07:23,056
A dish with a playful touch is superb!

87
00:07:23,057 --> 00:07:24,901
Fun to play and delicious to eat!

88
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,298
I must learn well.

89
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,099
Yes! A playful touch…

90
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:33,604
Let's make this!

91
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:48,182
Hey, Nadeshiko!

92
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:51,093
You guys finally made it!

93
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,718
It's been three months…

94
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:53,999
Aya!

95
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,405
Battered and bruised.

96
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:58,499
I leave the rest to you…

97
00:07:58,998 --> 00:08:00,109
Leave what to me?

98
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:02,797
Pitching the tent and stuff…

99
00:08:04,508 --> 00:08:06,489
I guess it can't be helped.

100
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:09,213
You don't look nearly as tired, Rin.

101
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:10,999
I'm used to it.

102
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:13,298
Ayano's camping equipment.

103
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:14,706
MOUNTAIN CLIMBING TENT,
DOWN FEATHER SLEEPING BAG, AIR MAT, HEADLIGHT

104
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,800
That's some nice gear you've got there.

105
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:18,202
Must be expensive.

106
00:08:18,202 --> 00:08:19,806
They're all used stuff.

107
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:21,709
Didn't cost me an arm and a leg.

108
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,510
Checking out others' camping gear

109
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,212
always gets me excited.

110
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:28,514
Compact stuff is seriously expensive.

111
00:08:29,002 --> 00:08:31,207
But you can't carry much on a bike,

112
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:33,624
so you've got to pay the hefty price
for the petites.

113
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:34,807
I get that.

114
00:08:35,707 --> 00:08:38,108
This is a tiny tent.

115
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:40,207
Isn't that a single-wall tent?

116
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:41,712
Single-wall?

117
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,606
A single-wall tent is essentially

118
00:08:44,606 --> 00:08:48,493
a lightweight tent that's waterproof
and breathable on its own,

119
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,098
without an outer fly.

120
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,712
It's mainly used for mountaineering.

121
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:56,202
Since it's made
from a single piece of fabric,

122
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:59,509
setting it up
and taking it down is super easy.

123
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:04,014
This tent is so easy to set up.

124
00:09:04,014 --> 00:09:08,311
Even a camping novice like me can do it.

125
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:09,936
Then do it yourself.

126
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:14,400
All set up.

127
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:17,166
"DIDN'T DO ANYTHING"
Ta-da, done!

128
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:21,806
It's about time

129
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:22,648
SUPER TASTY 100% BEEF HAMBURG STEAK

130
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,603
to start preparing dinner.

131
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:25,957
Hamburg steak!

132
00:09:26,998 --> 00:09:29,009
Is this the fabled hamburg steak?

133
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:30,207
Yes, yes!

134
00:09:30,207 --> 00:09:32,488
It's 100% beef! It's super delicious!

135
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,103
Now to fry 'em up…

136
00:09:34,103 --> 00:09:35,699
Aya, wait!

137
00:09:36,804 --> 00:09:37,999
The hamburg steak.

138
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:40,996
It needs to be heated in water along
with the bag at a low temperature first.

139
00:09:40,996 --> 00:09:42,212
At a low temperature?

140
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:48,196
Let's get cooking.

141
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:49,202
RAW HAMBURG STEAK

142
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:52,007
Raw hamburg steak must be vacuum-sealed

143
00:09:52,007 --> 00:09:56,103
or placed in a zip lock bag
with the air squeezed out.

144
00:09:56,103 --> 00:10:00,410
Then, use a thermometer to monitor
and adjust the heat to keep the water

145
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,801
at a temperature just below boiling

146
00:10:03,801 --> 00:10:04,869
for heating it indirectly.

147
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:09,107
If the temperature gets too high,
the meat will become tough.

148
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,697
But if it's too low,
it won't be sterilised.

149
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:13,905
Keeping it
at the right temperature is tricky.

150
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,691
So that's what you have to do.

151
00:10:19,097 --> 00:10:20,504
It's a sleeping bag bug.

152
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,894
All right.
I'll get started on the beef stew too.

153
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,102
Yay! Beef stew!

154
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:33,207
What's this?

155
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:34,806
Oh, this…

156
00:10:35,707 --> 00:10:38,004
Pot…

157
00:10:39,502 --> 00:10:41,394
What are you looking for, Rin?

158
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:43,100
Mum.

159
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,103
I was thinking of making beef stew
for this upcoming camping trip.

160
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,103
Have we got a spare pot?

161
00:10:48,103 --> 00:10:50,190
One big enough for three.

162
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:53,300
Oh, my. You sure are putting some thought
into your cooking now.

163
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:55,207
I don't think beef stew counts.

164
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:56,796
You just throw the roux in and cook it.

165
00:10:58,606 --> 00:10:59,841
Let's see…

166
00:10:59,842 --> 00:11:01,806
A spare pot, huh?

167
00:11:02,306 --> 00:11:05,707
The one you've been using is pretty small.

168
00:11:07,395 --> 00:11:08,598
Oh, that's right.

169
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,301
How about this?

170
00:11:11,301 --> 00:11:14,202
It's a pot I used back when I lived alone.

171
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:17,905
That's an oddly-shaped pot.

172
00:11:17,905 --> 00:11:19,301
This is a pressure pot.

173
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:22,717
Unlike ordinary pressure cookers,
this one is made of aluminium.

174
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:24,457
It's lightweight and practical.

175
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:26,790
It is light.

176
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,712
And all you need is

177
00:11:27,712 --> 00:11:30,196
cook it over low heat to get
that pressure in and make delicious meals.

178
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:31,504
It's perfect for camping, isn't it?

179
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:32,712
I see.

180
00:11:32,712 --> 00:11:34,894
Make beef stew with a pressure pot, huh?

181
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:38,905
By the way, how do you open this thing?

182
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:42,285
So that's a pressure pot.

183
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,108
Beef stew.

184
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:52,905
Firstly, in the pressure pot,

185
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:57,499
add the bite-sized beef shank
and sauté in olive oil.

186
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,296
Then, add water and red wine.

187
00:12:00,296 --> 00:12:02,098
Let it simmer
while skimming off any foam that forms.

188
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:04,591
Next, cover the pot, pressurise it,

189
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:08,014
and simmer over low heat
for about 30 minutes.

190
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,790
Once the beef shank is cooked,

191
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:16,004
replace half of the broth with water.

192
00:12:16,004 --> 00:12:19,091
Then, add onions, potatoes, and carrots.

193
00:12:19,092 --> 00:12:22,498
This time, pressure cook
for only about five minutes.

194
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:23,296
"BEEF STEW"
Finally,

195
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:25,598
"SLICED MUSHROOMS"
add roux and pre-boiled mushrooms,

196
00:12:25,598 --> 00:12:27,400
and simmer until the sauce thickens.

197
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,608
And there you have it.

198
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:33,905
The tendon in the beef shank

199
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:37,895
becomes incredibly tender
when slow-cooked.

200
00:12:37,895 --> 00:12:40,395
Melt-in-your-mouth beef is the best.

201
00:12:40,395 --> 00:12:41,301
But actually,

202
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:44,598
I've already prepared
the beef shank at home.

203
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:47,405
My mum said it would release a lot of fat.

204
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:51,108
It's better not to cook it on-site.

205
00:12:52,306 --> 00:12:55,301
Keeping all the broth
would make it too greasy, right?

206
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,691
The calorie count
would have gone through the roof.

207
00:12:57,692 --> 00:12:59,936
TIMER

208
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:02,400
The hamburg steaks should be ready.

209
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:07,411
That's a lot of meat juice!

210
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,608
"SUPER TASTY 100% BEEF HAMBURG STEAK"
Yep.

211
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:12,499
If you had cooked this straight away,
you'd have gotten a sea of meat juice.

212
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:13,702
That's why

213
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,702
you have to warm it up
over low heat first.

214
00:13:15,702 --> 00:13:17,723
Then, make an opening

215
00:13:17,724 --> 00:13:21,603
and pour the meat juices into a container.

216
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:22,900
I see.

217
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,690
If we had skipped that step,
the clean-up would be a huge pain.

218
00:13:26,691 --> 00:13:28,707
Fat freezes quickly in winter.

219
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:31,311
Without hot water,
it'll be a real hassle cleaning the pan.

220
00:13:33,106 --> 00:13:36,013
When I bought a grill last year,

221
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:38,092
we had a barbecue camp.

222
00:13:38,093 --> 00:13:40,311
-We got carried away
-Meat is so good!

223
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:41,253
-and made so much grilled pork belly
-The best!

224
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:42,195
-and pork skewers.
-The best!

225
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:44,504
The grill was drenched
in grease, fat, and oil.

226
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:46,410
It was a nightmare.

227
00:13:48,104 --> 00:13:51,204
How young and naive we were back then.

228
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:55,212
Well, we grow and learn through mistakes.

229
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,411
Making the clean-up process
as easy as possible

230
00:13:58,413 --> 00:14:00,708
is also crucial
when preparing camping meals, Aya.

231
00:14:01,214 --> 00:14:02,799
That's some valuable advice.

232
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:03,894
I'll keep it in mind.

233
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:05,993
All that's left to do is

234
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:09,716
to fry the hamburg steaks
until the sides are charred…

235
00:14:09,717 --> 00:14:11,207
Hey, Nadeshiko.

236
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,207
We've taken cared of the excess grease.

237
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:16,306
Why don't we try grilling the steaks
over the open fire?

238
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,978
We can stick them on chopsticks
and rotate them while we grill.

239
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,108
Great idea!

240
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:23,801
Now we're camp cooking.

241
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,598
Looks like the meat you see in manga.

242
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:36,796
Replace the chopsticks with bones
and you have the exact same thing.

243
00:14:37,412 --> 00:14:40,488
That aroma of the meat juices
searing over direct heat

244
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,202
is so tempting…

245
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:44,702
I can hardly resist taking a bite.

246
00:14:44,702 --> 00:14:46,009
I feel you.

247
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:48,400
But we must resist the temptation.

248
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,202
Eating undercooked hamburg steak
can be dangerous.

249
00:14:51,202 --> 00:14:53,904
Remember to cut it open
and check the inside.

250
00:14:53,905 --> 00:14:54,707
RICE

251
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:56,108
Beef stew, check.

252
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:57,587
Hamburg steaks, check.

253
00:14:57,587 --> 00:14:58,806
Rice, check.

254
00:14:58,806 --> 00:15:00,494
Omelettes, check.

255
00:15:01,055 --> 00:15:03,467
Leave the plating to me!

256
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:04,920
I've got an idea in mind!

257
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,004
Rice on both sides…

258
00:15:08,004 --> 00:15:10,202
Place the hamburg steak here…

259
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,796
Then, pour the onion sauce and beef stew…

260
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:16,900
Hatanagi Dam Beef Stew
Hamburg Steak Omurice

261
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,103
complete!

262
00:15:18,103 --> 00:15:19,806
It's the Hatanagi Dam!

263
00:15:19,806 --> 00:15:20,900
That's a long name.

264
00:15:21,405 --> 00:15:25,006
I was inspired
by the dam curry I had in Senzu.

265
00:15:25,006 --> 00:15:28,004
This dish represents
the Hatanagi Dam you guys visited.

266
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:32,888
That was a hellishly
long and dangerous road, huh, Rin?

267
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,399
I never want to go there by bike again.

268
00:15:35,905 --> 00:15:38,905
You girls went through a lot.

269
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,206
Yo!

270
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,212
Is this Takanotsume?
(Japanese hawk-claw chilli)

271
00:15:42,212 --> 00:15:45,212
It represents the suspension bridge
you crossed.

272
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,988
Takanotsume with beef stew,
not a combination you see every day.

273
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:52,306
We eat it this way a lot in our house.

274
00:15:52,306 --> 00:15:55,092
You can pick it out
if you're not good with spicy.

275
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:57,316
But if you can handle the heat
while biting into it,

276
00:15:57,316 --> 00:16:01,097
you'll experience a whole new flavour
with the spicy beef stew.

277
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,405
All right. Let's dig in while it's hot!

278
00:16:06,401 --> 00:16:07,597
I'm digging in.

279
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:09,213
Thank you for the meal.

280
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:18,504
So this is Hamamatsu's legendary
100% beef hamburg steak.

281
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:19,895
Bring it on!

282
00:16:24,602 --> 00:16:27,790
Meat…!

283
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:33,405
The texture of this meat is not only firm

284
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:35,894
but also gets more flavourful as you chew.

285
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,405
The texture is perfection!

286
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,301
"BEEF STEW"
While it's delicious paired with beef stew,

287
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,795
"ONION SAUCE"
it's absolutely heavenly when eaten

288
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,915
with onion sauce!

289
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,556
Aya, where did you buy
this hamburg steak from?

290
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:54,789
R… Rin, calm down…

291
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,602
I'll tell you in a moment.

292
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:05,411
The beef shank in Rin's beef stew
is so tender and tasty.

293
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:10,403
The rich broth goes perfectly with rice.

294
00:17:11,081 --> 00:17:12,680
Though it's simple,

295
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:16,817
the soft, fluffy, and runny omelette
acts as a perfect complement.

296
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:22,015
What a feast!

297
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:24,019
Now…

298
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,916
It's this guy's turn.

299
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:28,713
So spicy!

300
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,714
Yet so good!

301
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,097
Right?

302
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:32,999
I see.

303
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:35,244
It's like how you feel terrified
when crossing the bridge,

304
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:38,306
but when you look back on it,
it's a fond memory.

305
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,811
So that's what you aimed to depict
with the Takanotsume, huh?

306
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:45,254
You're a genius, Nadeshiko!

307
00:17:45,254 --> 00:17:48,598
Well, I didn't really think that deeply.

308
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:53,103
Your plates are almost out of onion sauce.

309
00:17:53,103 --> 00:17:54,702
This is the time

310
00:17:54,702 --> 00:17:58,257
to open the dam blocking the river…

311
00:17:59,597 --> 00:18:00,597
Open the gate!

312
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:05,792
So this is the little joy
you get with dam curry.

313
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,894
We're having beef stew, though.

314
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:09,399
Fun, right?

315
00:18:09,811 --> 00:18:10,712
But

316
00:18:10,712 --> 00:18:14,004
that's not all you can do
with the dam beef stew!

317
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:17,805
Meat juice oil lamp!

318
00:18:19,595 --> 00:18:22,304
I got the idea for this
from the canned tuna oil lamp.

319
00:18:22,305 --> 00:18:24,394
Just stick a piece of thick cotton thread
in the meat juice

320
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:26,201
and cool it down in the river.

321
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:35,696
Nice! It works!

322
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:38,555
It cuts the grease
and saves the environment.

323
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:44,113
I swear I can smell barbecue.

324
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:46,202
This is practically
a barbecue-scented candle!

325
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:57,613
Pork skewers and curry.

326
00:18:57,613 --> 00:18:58,790
You sure had a feast on your way here.

327
00:19:00,397 --> 00:19:01,304
After that,

328
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:04,305
I took the ABT-racked train here.

329
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:06,597
It was small and retro, so cute!

330
00:19:06,598 --> 00:19:08,696
Is that so?

331
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:10,701
We went to many suspension bridges

332
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:12,701
and a lot of places and had a blast.

333
00:19:12,701 --> 00:19:14,899
We even went to the tip of Shizuoka.

334
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:15,691
The tip?

335
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:17,212
Look.

336
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:18,806
Doesn't that look like a tip?

337
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:21,655
You guys sure went far.

338
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:23,305
We got carried away,

339
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:25,107
and now my bottom and shoulders are sore.

340
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:27,211
Good work making it this far.

341
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:31,904
If I count today's total,

342
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,795
I drove about 180 kilometres.

343
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:36,805
Might as well have gone
all the way to Yamanashi.

344
00:19:37,404 --> 00:19:40,201
Then before you leave,
you could swing by my place.

345
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:41,993
That's something I can't promise.

346
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,811
But someday,
I'll ride my bike to your place

347
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,712
and we'll hang out.

348
00:19:48,696 --> 00:19:50,688
I'll save up

349
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,603
to buy a bigger bike

350
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:55,311
and ride it

351
00:19:55,889 --> 00:19:57,306
to lots of places…

352
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:03,061
Aya?

353
00:20:09,899 --> 00:20:12,607
I had a lot of fun today, Aya.

354
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:16,131
Good night.

355
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,707
Ow…

356
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:22,403
You're up early, Nadeshiko.

357
00:22:22,403 --> 00:22:24,486
Good morning, Aya.

358
00:22:25,101 --> 00:22:28,502
Mornings in the mountains sure are cold.

359
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:29,514
Right?

360
00:22:30,201 --> 00:22:32,099
I have amazake. Want some?

361
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,992
Sure.

362
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:37,002
Here.

363
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:38,606
Thanks.

364
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:54,502
I just love

365
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:56,708
sipping on something warm

366
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,792
while watching the morning sun come out

367
00:22:58,793 --> 00:23:03,204
and everything light up when I'm camping.

368
00:23:07,705 --> 00:23:08,794
Yeah…

369
00:23:09,506 --> 00:23:10,710
I can relate.

370
00:23:27,704 --> 00:23:36,404
NEXT EPISODE: SEE YOU AGAIN

371
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,071
WHEN ENJOYING CAMPING,
BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RULES

372
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:37,596
OF THE CAMPGROUND AND ITS FACILITIES.

373
00:23:37,597 --> 00:23:38,710
DON'T FORGET TO PUT OUT YOUR CAMPFIRE
AND DISPOSE OF YOUR GARBAGE.

374
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:40,003
TEMPERATURES CAN CHANGE QUICKLY,
SO CHECK THE WEATHER FORECAST BEFOREHAND.

375
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:41,085
WEAR WARM CLOTHING IF NECESSARY
TO PREVENT COLD.
