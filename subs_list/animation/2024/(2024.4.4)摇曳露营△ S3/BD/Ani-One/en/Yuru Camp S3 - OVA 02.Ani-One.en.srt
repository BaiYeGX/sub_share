00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

2
00:00:01,459 --> 00:00:04,543
RAIN CAMP

3
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:06,444
I'll be staying for one night,
and I'll be riding my motorbike over.

4
00:00:06,445 --> 00:00:07,851
Are you sure?

5
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:09,742
It looks like it might rain later.

6
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:11,345
Rain?

7
00:00:11,346 --> 00:00:13,544
But I checked
the weather forecast before I left.

8
00:00:13,545 --> 00:00:16,752
The forecast said it wouldn't rain,

9
00:00:16,752 --> 00:00:18,960
but the weather in the mountains
can be unpredictable.

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,116
All the other guests have
cancelled their reservations too.

11
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:37,553
Good thing I can rent gear
at this campsite.

12
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:39,065
Without a tarp on a rainy day,

13
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:40,549
you can't do much of anything.

14
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:43,779
It's raining.

15
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:47,351
It took some time to set up,

16
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:48,263
but this is pretty convenient.

17
00:00:48,963 --> 00:00:51,659
You can't use
a camp stove inside the tent,

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,643
but under a tarp, it's no problem.

19
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,757
You hardly see any insects
when it's raining.

20
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:02,164
Makes for a comfy stay-in.

21
00:01:02,165 --> 00:01:03,055
CHA MANJU

22
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:04,258
Rain camp.

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,054
This campsite
at the foot of the mountain

24
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:10,966
is usually fully booked on weekends,

25
00:01:11,758 --> 00:01:12,857
but today there's no one else here.

26
00:01:13,446 --> 00:01:16,143
Guess a rainy day's the only time

27
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:17,857
you can have this campsite
all to yourself.

28
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:21,461
I even get this view of Mt. Fuji
all to myself.

29
00:01:28,444 --> 00:01:29,862
Rain camp.

30
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:32,445
This is nice,

31
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:34,466
"ARE CRYPTIDS REAL?"
reading a book

32
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,550
"ARE CRYPTIDS REAL?"
with the sound of the rain in the back.

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,147
T-Tsuchinoko?

34
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,758
Hello.

35
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:56,364
H…hello.

36
00:01:57,848 --> 00:01:59,251
Y…Yeti?

37
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:01,549
No, I'm a snowman.

38
00:02:04,356 --> 00:02:05,456
Rain camp.

39
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,659
Since I can't start a campfire,

40
00:02:09,047 --> 00:02:11,247
trying out things I normally wouldn't do

41
00:02:11,248 --> 00:02:13,367
is another way to enjoy a rain camp.

42
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,257
So

43
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:17,857
with some wood, I decided to

44
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:21,747
whittle a spoon

45
00:02:22,655 --> 00:02:25,253
If I can make little things
like this on the spot…

46
00:02:26,148 --> 00:02:28,451
I forgot to bring a spoon!

47
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,164
Rin, you're amazing!

48
00:02:33,557 --> 00:02:36,048
The neck of the spoon

49
00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:38,148
is tricky, though.

50
00:02:38,948 --> 00:02:41,550
I just couldn't get
the curve right with a knife.

51
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:44,039
I'll use the right tool to fix it
when I get home.

52
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:47,747
Now then, what should I do next?

53
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,367
Rain camp.

54
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,544
Going for a walk in the forest
on a rainy day is nice.

55
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:55,856
Don't have to worry

56
00:02:55,857 --> 00:02:57,972
about the rain getting too heavy either.

57
00:03:02,451 --> 00:03:03,461
Maybe I should head back.

58
00:03:04,947 --> 00:03:06,142
Rain camp.

59
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:14,341
There's something special
about eating curry ramen

60
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:15,648
with chopsticks I carved myself.

61
00:03:18,148 --> 00:03:19,554
Is the hook loose

62
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:20,956
because it got wet from the rain?

63
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:30,211
COLLAPSE

64
00:03:32,355 --> 00:03:33,648
Rain camp.

65
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:40,456
Rin, it's raining.
Is everything okay on your end?

66
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:41,961
Nadeshiko.

67
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:44,945
It looks like the clouds
are starting to clear.

68
00:03:44,945 --> 00:03:46,348
Everything's going just swell…

69
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:48,559
…or not.

70
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:51,445
Rin, you're really something

71
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:53,148
for camping in the rain.

72
00:03:53,148 --> 00:03:55,257
If it were me,
I'd definitely have given up.

73
00:03:55,258 --> 00:03:57,151
What do you even do while it's raining?

74
00:03:57,749 --> 00:04:00,268
Even in the rain,
you find ways to enjoy it.

75
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:02,659
That's what camping is all about, right?

76
00:04:03,354 --> 00:04:04,456
Sounding like a pro!

77
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:06,159
That's a real pro for you.

78
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,161
I'm going to turn in for the night.

79
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:09,455
Good night.

80
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:10,866
Good night.

81
00:04:10,873 --> 00:04:11,872
GOOD NIGHT

82
00:04:11,873 --> 00:04:12,846
GOOD NIGHT

83
00:04:14,652 --> 00:04:16,045
Like a pro, huh?

84
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:20,648
Rain camp.

85
00:04:38,558 --> 00:04:39,643
Rain camp.

86
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:42,346
There were a lot of issues,

87
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:47,351
but I guess this view
makes it all worth it.

88
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:51,257
There's still so much about camping

89
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,457
that I've got to learn.

90
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:58,758
Rain camp.
