1
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:11,699
The highest temperature for today
is 19 degrees.

2
00:00:12,505 --> 00:00:14,906
So, I won't get cold
with just a jacket on.

3
00:00:18,808 --> 00:00:21,102
The long winter has passed.

4
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:22,589
Spring is finally here.

5
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:30,505
This must be what Grandpa meant

6
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:31,704
before this.

7
00:00:32,802 --> 00:00:36,250
You've just gotten your license.
So, you may not know this.

8
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:39,901
But the best time to ride a motorbike
is during that short period

9
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:42,109
when the season changes.

10
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,906
When the season changes?

11
00:00:43,907 --> 00:00:45,211
Is it around April?

12
00:00:45,912 --> 00:00:46,813
That's right.

13
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,198
But the time is slightly different
for each region.

14
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,592
In this region, when it's almost April,

15
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:54,803
you won't feel cold with just a jacket on.

16
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,610
But it's not so hot that you'll sweat.

17
00:00:58,697 --> 00:01:01,609
Here, you'll sweat easily come April.

18
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:03,610
So, it's really just
a short period of time.

19
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:06,345
Now,

20
00:01:06,794 --> 00:01:08,896
it's that short period of time.

21
00:01:12,398 --> 00:01:14,808
Today, I'm going to have
a long-awaited solo camping.

22
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:31,006
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

23
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,504
EPISODE 9: BIKE AND CHERRY BLOSSOM TOUR
JUYA HOT SPRING CAMPING GROUND

24
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:58,702
Do I go down here to reach
the camping ground?

25
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:03,306
This is too steep. It's scary.

26
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,301
Do I still have to continue down?

27
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,103
Finally, I reached the camping ground.

28
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:30,003
Although it's not big,

29
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:32,811
there are many cherry blossom trees here.
It feels very relaxing.

30
00:03:36,397 --> 00:03:38,691
Although I heard that this place
is quite secretive,

31
00:03:38,692 --> 00:03:40,406
I didn't expect it to be empty.

32
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,305
After all, the entrance
is narrow and steep.

33
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:45,520
It's not easy to come here.

34
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:50,238
But thanks to that,
I have the place all to myself today.

35
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,499
This is...

36
00:03:55,604 --> 00:03:57,003
Forget it.

37
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:59,504
Let me set up the tent quickly
so that I can sit down and relax.

38
00:04:01,098 --> 00:04:02,212
It's done.

39
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:08,202
Is it car campers over there?

40
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:12,102
I want to try that style of camping
in the future too.

41
00:04:12,103 --> 00:04:13,718
It feels like it'll be easy
to pack up as well.

42
00:04:26,603 --> 00:04:29,306
I left home in the afternoon.
But it's just one o'clock right now.

43
00:04:30,696 --> 00:04:32,301
I better go and take a walk.

44
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,993
Is she a middle-school student?

45
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:40,998
Even a middle-school student
is doing solo camping now.

46
00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:43,008
This trend is really hitting us hard.

47
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:45,795
No. A middle-school student
can't ride a motorbike, right?

48
00:04:45,796 --> 00:04:47,301
So, is she a high-school student?

49
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:54,166
I don't think a high-school student will
camp at this kind of place for the trend.

50
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:55,945
Is she a university student?

51
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,905
Okay. We'll think of her
as a petite university student.

52
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:01,509
Here. The prawn fried rice is done.

53
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:02,769
Thank you.

54
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,807
Bon appetit.

55
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:13,488
Your cooking has become
so delicious because of camping.

56
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:15,510
Camping is amazing.

57
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:18,411
Well, do you want to live here
temporarily?

58
00:05:32,046 --> 00:05:34,817
RYUJIN BRIDGE, RYUMON BRIDGE

59
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:45,067
RYUMON BRIDGE

60
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,801
This bridge is so unique.

61
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:14,833
RYUJIN BRIDGE

62
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:21,905
So, I can go all the way

63
00:06:21,906 --> 00:06:24,203
to the hot spring up there
through this bridge.

64
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,812
But it looks tiring. So, I'll pass.

65
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:48,801
This is terrible.

66
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:50,995
They don't have a caretaker here.

67
00:06:52,192 --> 00:06:53,615
I can't believe it.

68
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:01,692
What is that girl doing?

69
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:08,093
I don't have enough garbage bags
to bag all the trash here.

70
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:10,092
And I'm riding a scooter.

71
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:12,306
I don't think I can take it back with me.

72
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,515
Good afternoon, what are you doing?

73
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,411
Hello.

74
00:07:17,412 --> 00:07:21,306
Someone left their trash here?

75
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,504
Miss, you came here on a scooter, right?

76
00:07:23,505 --> 00:07:25,703
Let us deal with the trash.

77
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:27,517
Really?

78
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:29,910
Yes. After all, we drove here.

79
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:32,493
Besides, we have some trash
from our camping too.

80
00:07:35,401 --> 00:07:38,056
There's no caretaker
in this camping ground.

81
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,702
If there's trash here,

82
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:43,796
this place will be closed down soon.

83
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,592
When someone is new to camping,

84
00:07:46,593 --> 00:07:48,894
if they aren't with someone
who's more experienced,

85
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:51,302
there'll be unexpectedly a lot of things
that they don't know.

86
00:07:51,303 --> 00:07:53,092
For example,
how to take care of the leftover coal.

87
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:55,098
But leaving trash behind is terrible.

88
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,999
Although it sounds like
we are good at this,

89
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,599
we've only started camping last year.
So, we are quite new to it.

90
00:08:02,997 --> 00:08:04,312
I see.

91
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:05,806
But

92
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:08,194
fortunately, we know a friend
who loves camping.

93
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:10,509
So, we've learnt a lot from him.

94
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,295
About how to clean up after camping,

95
00:08:13,296 --> 00:08:16,103
he has said something remarkable.

96
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:18,691
When you leave,
don't leave any trace behind

97
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:21,405
as if you are being
tracked by an assassin.

98
00:08:21,406 --> 00:08:23,302
An assassin...

99
00:08:23,802 --> 00:08:26,411
But it's easy to understand.

100
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:29,295
Comes to think of it,

101
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:31,650
are you a university student
who's studying nearby?

102
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:33,900
No. I'm a high school student.

103
00:08:33,901 --> 00:08:35,993
But I do live nearby.

104
00:08:35,994 --> 00:08:37,697
So, you are a high-school student.

105
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,592
It seems like you are very used
to camping solo.

106
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:44,681
So, we thought that you were
a university student just now.

107
00:08:44,682 --> 00:08:46,797
I see.

108
00:08:50,406 --> 00:08:51,697
"BLACK COFFEE"
So bitter.

109
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:54,197
I'm sorry. It must be bitter to you.

110
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:55,504
I have sugar here.

111
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:57,015
I'm sorry about that.

112
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,697
I heard that if you like bitter things,

113
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:04,000
it's because your tongue
has become less sensitive as you age.

114
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,604
It means that you are still young.

115
00:09:08,802 --> 00:09:11,500
I thought you loved
your black coffee, Ogawa.

116
00:09:17,102 --> 00:09:18,807
Comes to think of it,

117
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:21,406
when I first started camping,

118
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:25,109
my grandpa told me

119
00:09:25,808 --> 00:09:28,108
to bring back everything I brought
to the campsite from home.

120
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:33,104
It'll be nice if more and more campers
think like that.

121
00:09:34,494 --> 00:09:36,004
Let's pull myself together

122
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:37,396
and start making some camping food.

123
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:40,203
Her lunch for today

124
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:45,099
is spinach and tomato pasta that can
be cooked with just a camping cooking pot.

125
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:47,901
Hello.

126
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,198
Rin.

127
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:52,712
These are our souvenirs
from the Mizugaki camping trip.

128
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:54,806
We use these tomatoes to make pizzas

129
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:56,692
and they were delicious.

130
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,691
Let's start cooking.

131
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:06,104
First, fry the bacon
in the pot until crispy.

132
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:09,311
Then, add a spoonful of olive oil,

133
00:10:09,312 --> 00:10:13,290
garlic paste and sliced hawk-claw chillies
and turn up the heat.

134
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:16,880
Next, add a medium-sized tomato
that's cut into four into the pot.

135
00:10:16,881 --> 00:10:19,701
Mix the ingredients
until they are fully cooked.

136
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:22,912
Girl.

137
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,099
Girls.

138
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:27,806
Garlic.

139
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,003
Then,

140
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,702
when the tomato is soft and mushy,

141
00:10:32,703 --> 00:10:35,401
add spinach and 200cc of water.

142
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:38,151
Sprinkle some seasoned salt
and cook until it's boiling.

143
00:10:39,997 --> 00:10:41,988
Next, break 100g of pasta

144
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:45,598
into two and cook it in the pot.

145
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:48,202
No Italians are watching me, right?

146
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,400
Right before the pasta is fully cooked.

147
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:56,004
Add two medium-sized tomatoes
that are cubed.

148
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:59,490
Then cook it over high heat
to evaporate some of the water.

149
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,696
Is adding three tomatoes too much?

150
00:11:02,697 --> 00:11:04,306
Lastly,

151
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:07,099
"A ONE-POT RECIPE"
add half a tablespoon of olive oil

152
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,405
"SPINACH AND TOMATO PASTA"
and season with seasoned salt.

153
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:10,894
And you are done.

154
00:11:10,895 --> 00:11:11,702
That's great.

155
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:13,400
"MY FIRST OUTDOOR MEAL"
Hi.

156
00:11:13,401 --> 00:11:16,300
"100 SIMPLE RECIPES"
I haven't used this book in a long time.

157
00:11:17,706 --> 00:11:19,803
Bon appetit.

158
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:39,801
The pasta sauce made from the mushy tomato

159
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:42,797
and the half-cooked tomatoes

160
00:11:43,394 --> 00:11:45,693
is simple but delicious.

161
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,497
The tomatoes taste great.

162
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,008
The cherry blossom season is almost here.

163
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:23,899
What are you doing?

164
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:26,998
I didn't realise

165
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,107
that only the top of that mountain
was covered in cherry blossom trees.

166
00:12:31,609 --> 00:12:32,792
You are right.

167
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,118
Is there anything over there?

168
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:38,107
I think there's
a temple or shrine over there.

169
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:42,397
I'm curious now.

170
00:12:42,398 --> 00:12:45,002
Should I ride a bike there
and check it out tomorrow?

171
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:47,565
Nadeshiko, are you free tomorrow?

172
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,393
I'm not working tomorrow. So, I'm free.

173
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:53,897
Do you want to go on
a cherry blossom drive this year?

174
00:12:55,492 --> 00:12:57,211
Yes!

175
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,810
Cherry blossom tour...

176
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:05,413
I'm going on a drive today,
and I'll go camping tomorrow.

177
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:07,404
I'll be enjoying the cherry blossom view
this whole week.

178
00:13:10,992 --> 00:13:12,601
It's packed.

179
00:13:19,607 --> 00:13:20,998
Delicious...

180
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:22,909
It's time to depart.

181
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,602
Delicious.

182
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:33,706
I want to climb the stairs, Sakura.

183
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:54,201
I've arrived!

184
00:13:55,513 --> 00:13:58,107
Your stamina has improved.

185
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:11,377
UTSUBUNA PARK, MALLET GOLF COURSE

186
00:14:20,404 --> 00:14:22,392
All of the flowers are blossoming.

187
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:25,405
This is what we saw from our home.
So, this is the cherry blossom.

188
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,502
I never thought
that there would be a park here.

189
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:30,903
Since it's so well hidden,

190
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,102
is it a secret park?

191
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:35,408
After all,
it's not easy to drive here either.

192
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:36,805
Maybe you are right.

193
00:14:39,105 --> 00:14:39,743
Very good.

194
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,504
It's a great photo.

195
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,991
Let's go to the next place.

196
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:44,601
Okay.

197
00:14:47,201 --> 00:14:48,013
By the way,

198
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:50,194
Aki told us that if we wanted to view
some cherry blossom,

199
00:14:50,195 --> 00:14:52,700
we should go to Mt. Minobu.

200
00:14:53,111 --> 00:14:55,898
I think the cherry blossom tree there
is quite famous.

201
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:59,201
MT. MINOBU, KUON-JI

202
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:04,945
It's huge.

203
00:15:06,951 --> 00:15:09,543
FULL, ONE-WAY

204
00:15:09,544 --> 00:15:10,991
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:12,991
The parking lot ahead is full.

206
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:15,106
There's no way for you to stop.

207
00:15:15,107 --> 00:15:17,595
What should we do now, Sakura?

208
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:20,403
Okay. I'll turn right ahead there.

209
00:15:23,004 --> 00:15:26,007
Aren't we here to view
the hanging cherry blossom of Mt. Minobu?

210
00:15:26,706 --> 00:15:29,301
Since there's nowhere to park,
we have no choice.

211
00:15:29,302 --> 00:15:30,897
But even if we can't go up,

212
00:15:30,898 --> 00:15:34,002
there are still trees planted
on the roadside nearby.

213
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:36,106
We can view them while we drive.

214
00:15:36,107 --> 00:15:37,503
Okay.

215
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:55,597
Although we can't go up,
this is still a feast to our eyes.

216
00:16:21,894 --> 00:16:25,201
I'm going on a cherry blossom drive
with my sister now.

217
00:16:25,807 --> 00:16:29,004
A cherry blossom drive.

218
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:16,997
IT LOOKS BETTER FROM OVER HERE.

219
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,507
I accidentally fell asleep again.

220
00:17:32,508 --> 00:17:35,194
Let me pack up and go to the hot spring.

221
00:17:35,195 --> 00:17:37,403
After all, the hot spring
is only open until two in the afternoon.

222
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:40,315
Okay.

223
00:17:42,008 --> 00:17:44,399
Those two people have left.

224
00:17:45,297 --> 00:17:48,518
I haven't had a laid-back
solo camping in a long time.

225
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,800
I'll come here again
for my next solo camping.

226
00:17:56,607 --> 00:18:01,508
The hill is so steep
that I think my scooter can't make it.

227
00:18:04,806 --> 00:18:08,513
There are many steep slopes around here.

228
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:19,518
TOGE NO YU HOTSPRING RESORT, OPEN

229
00:18:20,014 --> 00:18:22,391
Finally, I've arrived.

230
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,397
Miss.

231
00:18:23,398 --> 00:18:25,507
Are you the one who called
to make a reservation?

232
00:18:25,508 --> 00:18:27,392
Yes.

233
00:18:27,393 --> 00:18:28,992
That'll be 700 yen.

234
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:30,612
Here you go.

235
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:33,804
The hot spring is over there.

236
00:18:33,805 --> 00:18:34,898
Thank you.

237
00:18:35,211 --> 00:18:36,404
Enjoy your hot spring.

238
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:43,081
THE SECRET HOTSPRING AT THE TOP

239
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,705
It really has
the hot-spring-in-the-mountain vibe.

240
00:18:54,804 --> 00:18:57,594
This hot spring spot is amazing.

241
00:18:58,302 --> 00:19:01,299
If I come here in the morning or
in the evening, it'll be even prettier.

242
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:10,694
Although it's fenced up,

243
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:13,502
if I fall from here, I'll get hurt, right?

244
00:19:15,403 --> 00:19:18,304
I'm going on a cherry blossom camping
with Chiaki and the others tomorrow.

245
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,304
I think the weather
will be good for a while.

246
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:22,399
Very good.

247
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:25,305
Comes to think of it,

248
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:29,003
I was supposed to go
to that camping ground with Nadeshiko.

249
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:33,102
But she couldn't make it
because she was sick.

250
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,200
I think after that,
I went to Jinbagatayama.

251
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,503
So, that was almost four months ago.

252
00:19:44,607 --> 00:19:47,211
I'll invite you next time.

253
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,289
Although I've gone camping
in many other places,

254
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,300
I haven't been able to invite her alone.

255
00:19:53,905 --> 00:19:56,612
But it seems like she doesn't mind.

256
00:19:57,794 --> 00:20:01,513
It's hard to invite someone to come along
when you've missed the right timing.

257
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,507
It's April now.

258
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,008
So, it's starting from today.

259
00:20:15,205 --> 00:20:17,797
You are going to go
for a cherry blossom ride later?

260
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:20,792
Yes. I'll ride around the basin later.

261
00:20:20,793 --> 00:20:22,006
If that's the case,

262
00:20:22,007 --> 00:20:24,596
I think it'll be good to go around
the outside of the basin.

263
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:29,105
I took that route when I rode a road bike
from Shimizu to Saitama last year.

264
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:30,302
It's a nice route.

265
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:32,006
It has many flower-viewing spots too.

266
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:33,023
A road bike?

267
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:35,506
It's a road bike.

268
00:20:35,507 --> 00:20:36,900
Something like a sports bike.

269
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,610
A bike with this kind of handle.

270
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:41,302
You rode a bike for such a long distance?

271
00:20:41,303 --> 00:20:43,000
That's just normal.

272
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:44,401
Although it takes more time,

273
00:20:44,402 --> 00:20:46,202
it's faster than you expect.

274
00:20:47,285 --> 00:20:49,209
When you get used to it,
you can ride it really fast.

275
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,199
So, that's what a road bike looks like.

276
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,594
Until last year, I still rode my bike
on Motosu Road to go camping.

277
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:58,511
But after experiencing
the convenience of a motorbike,

278
00:20:58,512 --> 00:21:00,215
I don't want to ride a bike anymore.

279
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:01,699
Ride me once in a while too.

280
00:21:02,902 --> 00:21:04,511
A road bike?

281
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:06,704
I think Nadeshiko
can ride very fast with it.

282
00:21:06,705 --> 00:21:07,292
ENGINE MODEL: NADESHIKO KAGAMIHARA
MAXIMUM HORSEPOWER: 43PS

283
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:07,908
MAXIMUM TORQUE: 45.3N⋅M,
FUEL TYPE: MINOBU BUN

284
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:10,193
"FUEL CONSUMPTION RATE: ONE BUN PER 20M"
She can go 20m with one Minobu bun.

285
00:21:10,194 --> 00:21:11,449
"FUEL CONSUMPTION RATE IN RACING MODE"
That's too much.

286
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:15,897
This hot spring is really not bad.

287
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,109
Yes.

288
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:21,802
See you again if fate allows it.

289
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:23,798
See you at another
camping ground next time.

290
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:24,799
Okay.

291
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:36,012
The cherry blossom drive is going north.

292
00:21:46,145 --> 00:21:49,406
Let me go on a cherry blossom ride too.

293
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:36,396
NEXT EPISODE: CHIKUWA,
TRAM AND CHIAKI SOLO CAMPING

294
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:36,996
WHEN ENJOYING CAMPING,
BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RULES

295
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:37,583
OF THE CAMPGROUND AND ITS FACILITIES.

296
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:38,596
DON'T FORGET TO PUT OUT YOUR CAMPFIRE
AND DISPOSE OF YOUR GARBAGE.

297
00:23:38,597 --> 00:23:39,796
TEMPERATURES CAN CHANGE QUICKLY,
SO CHECK THE WEATHER FORECAST BEFOREHAND.

298
00:23:39,797 --> 00:23:41,010
WEAR WARM CLOTHING IF NECESSARY
TO PREVENT COLD.
