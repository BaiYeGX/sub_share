00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:33,600
It feels nice to drive on the route

7
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:34,904
Sakura told me about.

8
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:37,126
Let's see.

9
00:02:37,127 --> 00:02:38,798
I came from the Western Line

10
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,705
and passed through the Mount Kayagatake
Broad Area Agriculture Line.

11
00:02:42,499 --> 00:02:45,299
I should take the Shosen Green Line next.

12
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,523
There are so many cats around this lake.

13
00:03:06,808 --> 00:03:10,106
I knew it. It's easier with dogs.

14
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:14,109
Here's your vegetable soup, Sakura.

15
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,810
Thank you.

16
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:21,001
It's a nice day
to admire the cherry blossoms.

17
00:03:21,002 --> 00:03:22,298
Agreed.

18
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,203
The sunshine is so warm and cosy.

19
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:26,803
Looks like it's going to
start raining next week.

20
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:29,397
This could be the last chance
to see the cherry blossoms this year.

21
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:32,106
I'm glad we came out
while the sun was still out.

22
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:34,938
We started having cherry blossom drives

23
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:38,105
after you got your driving license.

24
00:03:38,106 --> 00:03:39,903
This year marks...

25
00:03:40,308 --> 00:03:41,511
The third time.

26
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,888
Yeah!

27
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,298
It'll be great to come see

28
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,408
the cherry blossoms every year.

29
00:03:48,894 --> 00:03:52,023
You're going to college.
Who can say for sure?

30
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:55,007
You have a point.

31
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,905
What do you plan to do after graduating?

32
00:04:14,903 --> 00:04:16,606
Well...

33
00:04:23,793 --> 00:04:27,390
"NADESHIKO"
Going cherry blossom viewing with Sakura.

34
00:04:27,391 --> 00:04:29,006
Rin is solo-camping.

35
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,898
Nadeshiko and her sister
are viewing cherry blossoms.

36
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,892
Let's get going, Chikuwa.

37
00:04:42,502 --> 00:04:44,195
Chikuwa, look over here!

38
00:04:55,893 --> 00:04:57,508
Hyah.

39
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,605
Such a pleasant day.

40
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:05,804
Today might be perfect for camping.

41
00:05:08,195 --> 00:05:09,299
What's wrong?

42
00:05:12,394 --> 00:05:14,798
Oh my, do you like that bag?

43
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,606
You really do like
squeezing into narrow spaces.

44
00:05:20,398 --> 00:05:22,216
Such a good dog.

45
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:26,908
Good dog.

46
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:28,898
Was that too much?

47
00:05:32,596 --> 00:05:34,897
The whole place
is full of cherry blossoms!

48
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:37,095
Ena, where are you headed today?

49
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:38,590
The weather seems nice.

50
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:40,213
I took Chikuwa with me

51
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,507
and went for a walk in Fujikawa Park.

52
00:05:43,196 --> 00:05:45,001
It's slowly getting warmer lately.

53
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:47,798
This is perfect for Chikuwa
since it never likes cold days.

54
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:51,084
I thought so too.
I didn't put thick clothes on it,

55
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:54,194
but it still felt cold somehow.
It's cooped up in the bag.

56
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:56,586
It looks like a turtle.

57
00:05:57,392 --> 00:05:59,608
Today is the end
of your business trip, right?

58
00:06:00,002 --> 00:06:03,293
I get two days off
after I get off work this afternoon.

59
00:06:03,294 --> 00:06:04,209
Sorry.

60
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,111
It's my bad

61
00:06:05,112 --> 00:06:07,314
we can't fix a date
for the cherry blossom camping trip.

62
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,397
Don't feel bad.

63
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:10,595
Everyone has a job.

64
00:06:10,596 --> 00:06:12,006
It's only right to be considerate.

65
00:06:12,007 --> 00:06:13,809
What's your plan for today?

66
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,808
Me? I...

67
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,709
I came a day early
to book a camping spot!

68
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,621
While I'm at it,
I'm experiencing solo camping.

69
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,397
Rin is camping alone too.

70
00:06:25,398 --> 00:06:27,606
I thought the timing was wonderful.

71
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,012
This is my first time solo camping.

72
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,711
Aki, you finally muster the courage
to try out solo camping.

73
00:06:34,211 --> 00:06:36,492
Stay safe on your way to the campsite.

74
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:40,704
The whole trip is considering
camping until you reach the site.

75
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:42,401
What is it called
when I reach the place?

76
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:45,110
See you tomorrow.

77
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:46,611
Sure. See you.

78
00:06:49,997 --> 00:06:52,006
The sunshine is so cosy.

79
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:54,497
It's making me a bit sleepy.

80
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:02,106
Almost all the cherry blossom trees
are in full bloom.

81
00:07:03,111 --> 00:07:05,960
I did my sketching
at the observatory square.

82
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,809
I should try sketching
on the green square today.

83
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:16,596
Someone is sleeping here.

84
00:07:17,195 --> 00:07:19,491
She is sleeping so soundly.

85
00:07:19,492 --> 00:07:22,008
Doesn't that hurt her back?

86
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:31,606
There is a cute creature
hiding in the bag!

87
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:34,392
A Pomeranian?

88
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:36,392
No, probably a Chihuahua.

89
00:07:36,393 --> 00:07:38,204
Nope, that's not the point here.

90
00:07:38,205 --> 00:07:39,903
I have to finish the drawing today.

91
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:44,606
All right.

92
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,804
I wonder how much
I can draw by the evening.

93
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:04,601
Just a little bit of sketching.

94
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,584
I'm... I'm sorry!

95
00:08:23,585 --> 00:08:25,670
Well... You know...

96
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,298
I just thought the dog looked cute
when it was asleep...

97
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,611
-That's why...
-I see.

98
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:31,798
You're really good at drawing.

99
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:35,013
No... I'm terrible at drawing.

100
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:39,293
Do you always link
this drawing pad to your smartphone?

101
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:40,892
Do you mind if I give it a try?

102
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:42,008
Be my guest.

103
00:08:44,303 --> 00:08:45,898
This thing is pretty neat.

104
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:51,496
I've heard
how violent a Chihuahua could be.

105
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,695
But this little guy here
is very tame.

106
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:56,600
It's fallen asleep again.

107
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:57,903
You're so cute.

108
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,288
This thing isn't too bad at all.

109
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,499
I want to get a tablet for my drawing,

110
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,506
but I just couldn't
spend that much money on one.

111
00:09:05,507 --> 00:09:08,299
Yeah. A tablet can be quite expensive.

112
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:13,205
"ALARM"
Time to get working.

113
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,105
Thanks for letting me use that.

114
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:16,215
Don't mention it.

115
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:21,195
See you around.
Good luck with your drawing.

116
00:09:25,903 --> 00:09:27,018
Ena, where are you now?

117
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,109
I'm at the green square.

118
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:30,794
All right.

119
00:09:34,496 --> 00:09:36,315
Hey there, Ena.

120
00:09:37,492 --> 00:09:38,601
I'm here.

121
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:41,107
You actually came.

122
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:43,606
I have some free time to kill anyway.

123
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:47,002
You're still such a great artist.

124
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:49,504
After you get into high school,

125
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,110
you'll probably join the manga club
or the art club.

126
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,407
I don't draw manga.

127
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:57,804
And I don't think
I'll fit into the art club.

128
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:03,293
I'd like to join a club
that studies illustration.

129
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:06,299
I've never heard of a club like that.

130
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,511
So, there isn't one.

131
00:10:08,512 --> 00:10:10,392
I guess I'll just go home after school.

132
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:13,699
I'll work extra hard and save up money
to buy myself a drawing tablet.

133
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,433
The one with the impressive stylus?

134
00:10:16,434 --> 00:10:18,105
Bingo.

135
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:20,402
Why not ask your mum
to buy you one?

136
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,704
Tell her it's a gift
for getting into high school.

137
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:26,208
I don't think my parents
will ever buy me that kind of stuff.

138
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,605
After getting into high school,

139
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:36,605
I should find a hobby or something.

140
00:10:36,606 --> 00:10:39,012
There's no need to force yourself
into doing anything.

141
00:10:42,397 --> 00:10:45,501
But I want to be like you.

142
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:47,502
I want to find my passion.

143
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:51,705
I bought some snacks.
Would you like some?

144
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:53,299
Sure.

145
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:58,455
HIGASHIYAMA BROAD AREA AGRICULTURE LINE,
FRUIT LINE

146
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:14,001
Follow the Western Line.

147
00:11:14,002 --> 00:11:16,886
Then, the Mount Kayagatake
Broad Area Agriculture Line.

148
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:19,303
After that, the Shosen Green Line

149
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,699
and the Fruit Line.

150
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,194
From there, take the Shirai Koshu Line,

151
00:11:23,195 --> 00:11:24,511
Miyasaka Road,

152
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:27,011
Kanegawa Broad Area Agriculture Line.

153
00:11:27,012 --> 00:11:31,006
That makes one complete lap
around the Kofu Basin.

154
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:33,610
It feels like overlooking
the surroundings of a basin.

155
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:35,204
Given it's a complete circle,

156
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:37,502
it kind of reminds me
of taking a tour around a volcano.

157
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:39,085
Huh?

158
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,809
I think I've taken this road before.

159
00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:03,387
Lights are
slowly being turned up in the town.

160
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:04,699
If you keep looking that way,

161
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,710
you'll see even more places lighting up.

162
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:09,893
Well then,

163
00:12:09,894 --> 00:12:12,607
let's pull over and take a good look.

164
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,612
I remember now.

165
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:31,386
This was the road

166
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:33,012
we took that day.

167
00:12:41,497 --> 00:12:44,694
There seems to be
a light show here at night.

168
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,398
Really?

169
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:49,002
Should we come again at night?

170
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:51,107
If it's not very crowded.

171
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:54,710
Sakura! Take a picture for me!

172
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,606
That hole is not for you
to show your peace sign.

173
00:13:02,102 --> 00:13:03,698
Let me have a look.

174
00:13:06,397 --> 00:13:09,386
That makes using the cardboard
stand-ins completely pointless!

175
00:13:09,393 --> 00:13:10,893
Onto the next spot, Nadeshiko.

176
00:13:14,393 --> 00:13:15,506
Sakura.

177
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:18,507
Is there a bird pattern on that hill?

178
00:13:19,605 --> 00:13:21,617
It does look like a bird.

179
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:24,100
What could it be?

180
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:25,898
I wonder.

181
00:13:31,512 --> 00:13:33,491
KATSUNUMA

182
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,496
Just today alone,

183
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:43,622
I've already filled
the album with cherry blossoms.

184
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,909
Everything is pink.

185
00:13:48,498 --> 00:13:52,195
There is a retro train in the park
in front of the station, Rin.

186
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,013
Huh? Is this...

187
00:13:55,388 --> 00:13:57,409
JINROKU CHERRY BLOSSOMS PARK

188
00:14:01,605 --> 00:14:04,301
The train is so old-school and cute.

189
00:14:04,794 --> 00:14:05,612
Cute?

190
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:08,200
An impression of the train.

191
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,216
What is she doing?

192
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:17,815
You're really into retro trains lately.

193
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:21,402
After taking a ride
on the Abt System Railway in Oi River,

194
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,908
I just fell in love with these trains.

195
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:28,298
"TOKOGAWA RAILWAY MUSEUM"
I saw this on TV once.

196
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:32,303
It says there is
a museum of retro trains in Gunma.

197
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:33,398
Really?

198
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:34,898
If I'm not mistaken...

199
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:37,204
Found it. This is it.

200
00:14:37,205 --> 00:14:39,511
Yokogawa Railway Museum.

201
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,897
Show me.

202
00:14:41,895 --> 00:14:44,351
"YOKOGAWA RAILWAY MUSEUM"
So many retro trains!

203
00:14:46,997 --> 00:14:50,305
They have an Abt System Train too.

204
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:52,682
The location is...

205
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:56,699
It's about the same distance
between here and Hamamatsu.

206
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,205
It isn't that far from here.

207
00:14:58,995 --> 00:15:00,569
Maybe I should go solo camping in Gunma

208
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,304
for my retro-train field study camp.

209
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:06,601
It's better to go camping with everyone.

210
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:11,403
Here you are.

211
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:15,902
SOUTH IDE CAMPSITE

212
00:15:15,903 --> 00:15:19,002
The South Ide Campsite is only

213
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,398
a 50-minute walk from the station.

214
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:26,308
Plenty of cherry blossoms here too.

215
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:28,803
I asked Rin about it beforehand,

216
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:29,896
but there really is a toilet here.

217
00:15:29,897 --> 00:15:31,402
There's no water source.

218
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:33,695
A rather challenging campsite indeed.

219
00:15:34,408 --> 00:15:38,502
But since there's no one here
and the site is free to use,

220
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:40,599
this is likely a very secret camping spot.

221
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,402
Impressive, site hunter Rin Shima.
Great job.

222
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:45,194
Setting the tent in no time.

223
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,314
The bed for today is all set.

224
00:15:50,193 --> 00:15:51,512
Well then...

225
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:53,792
When you go solo camping,

226
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:57,497
it's important to plan a way
to kill your free time, Aki.

227
00:15:58,107 --> 00:16:01,297
Rin likes to read.
Nadeshiko experiments with her recipes.

228
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:03,512
I can kill my time with...

229
00:16:06,413 --> 00:16:07,199
CINNAMON STICK

230
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,204
Homemade non-alcoholic cocktail!

231
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:12,512
The non-alcoholic cocktail
we're making today is

232
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,896
the Spicy Saratoga Cooler.

233
00:16:14,897 --> 00:16:17,308
It's a cocktail made with ginger ale.

234
00:16:17,996 --> 00:16:19,396
First, in a small pot,

235
00:16:19,397 --> 00:16:23,891
add 70cc of water
and 60 grams of coarse sugar and heat it.

236
00:16:23,892 --> 00:16:25,011
When the water boils,

237
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:26,698
add one portion of lime peel,

238
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,694
half a cinnamon stick,

239
00:16:28,695 --> 00:16:30,912
20 grams of fresh ginger slices,

240
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:33,002
and a preferred amount of cloves.

241
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,917
Since we are making spicy Saratoga Cooler,

242
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:40,500
we'll use Havana chilli powder to replace
regular chili to bring out the spiciness.

243
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:41,907
Gently...

244
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,990
If you add too much Havana chilli powder,
it'll be extremely spicy.

245
00:16:45,991 --> 00:16:48,199
Be very careful.

246
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:50,808
Cook for about three minutes
and then turn off the heat.

247
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:52,490
After it has cooled slightly,

248
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:55,803
add another 20 grams
of fresh ginger slices

249
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:57,370
and let it ferment overnight.

250
00:16:57,371 --> 00:16:59,016
But I want to have it right away.

251
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,912
So I'll just let it sit for an hour.

252
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:02,495
Well then...

253
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:05,397
While waiting for the syrup to cool,
I can pass my time with...

254
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,606
A homemade bracelet
made with paracord.

255
00:17:10,194 --> 00:17:12,913
I've always wanted to try this.

256
00:17:13,788 --> 00:17:15,198
"PARACORD"
The paracord

257
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,402
is a high-strength parachute cord with
thin strands enclosed in a nylon sheath.

258
00:17:19,403 --> 00:17:23,085
The inner strands can be removed.

259
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:29,214
The strands can be replaced with sewing
thread, dental floss, or fishing line.

260
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,401
Some paracords even contain
combustible material inside,

261
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:35,813
which can be used
to start a fire when necessary.

262
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:39,908
It is a piece of outdoor equipment
that is more useful than it appears.

263
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,402
Let's try making it right away.

264
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:47,095
Like so.

265
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:49,007
Then...

266
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:51,513
Tie multiple knots.

267
00:17:52,006 --> 00:17:53,614
And the line goes through here.

268
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:56,507
Burn the open ends.

269
00:17:57,295 --> 00:18:01,701
"COBRA KNOT PARACORD BRACELET"
The cobra knot paracord bracelet is ready.

270
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,095
This is a lot easier than expected.

271
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:07,200
Wearing it makes me feel
like a fashionable camper.

272
00:18:07,705 --> 00:18:09,101
Now...

273
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:11,961
My ginger syrup should be ready by now.

274
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:15,193
Put the pre-peeled lime into a glass,

275
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,944
then pour in the ginger syrup
and sparkling water.

276
00:18:19,405 --> 00:18:22,601
The spicy Saratoga Cooler is now ready!

277
00:18:24,907 --> 00:18:28,397
This spicy aroma is quite appetizing.

278
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,270
Too spicy! It's super spicy!

279
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:36,501
It seems like I added
too much Havana chilli powder,

280
00:18:36,502 --> 00:18:39,199
but the taste is still quite good.

281
00:18:39,705 --> 00:18:42,897
I should dilute it a little
before drinking.

282
00:18:42,898 --> 00:18:45,502
By the way,
I still need to make some side dishes.

283
00:18:51,403 --> 00:18:53,007
All right. It's done.

284
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,694
Sauted potatoes with sausages.

285
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,002
A simple sauteed dish.

286
00:18:59,003 --> 00:19:00,794
But it should taste just right.

287
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:03,099
Here goes nothing.

288
00:19:11,101 --> 00:19:12,606
This is awesome!

289
00:19:13,296 --> 00:19:16,908
The heat from an alcohol burner
is enough for a person's meal.

290
00:19:19,694 --> 00:19:21,809
Nice and relaxing.

291
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:26,507
Now I understand why Rin
is so passionate about solo-camping.

292
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,193
That's right. The teacher said,

293
00:19:30,194 --> 00:19:33,963
"I'll prepare the food for
our cherry blossom viewing trip tomorrow."

294
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,006
What is she preparing?

295
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,610
WINE

296
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:39,022
This is concerning.

297
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:41,798
I should finish the remaining potatoes.

298
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:44,309
SPINACH CORN

299
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,205
Another simple yet delicious dish.

300
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,814
Is this a stray from this area?

301
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:01,199
Nope!

302
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,908
This is too much salt for a cat!

303
00:20:05,402 --> 00:20:07,309
Unbelievable.

304
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:11,830
If I'm not mistaken,
a cat can have some apple.

305
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:13,715
Wait there.

306
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,804
Here you go.

307
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,304
You look very clean for a stray.

308
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:24,306
That's right.

309
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,710
I found a cat at the campsite.

310
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:33,506
You're having a great time over there.

311
00:20:33,507 --> 00:20:36,303
I wish you were here too, Inuko.

312
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:38,600
I said I'd be busy today.

313
00:20:38,601 --> 00:20:39,987
We'll head there tomorrow.

314
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,908
Enjoy your time alone tonight.

315
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:43,908
Okay.

316
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:47,804
Come on. Are you leaving already?

317
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:50,815
Cats are so unpredictable.

318
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:52,089
Whatever.

319
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,111
I'm headed for the hot spring.

320
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,006
WELCOME TO SOUTH IDE HOT SPRING

321
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,601
Arrived at the hot spring.

322
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:05,892
What? You live here?

323
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:13,204
Long ago,

324
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,506
there lived a girl named Chiaki Ohgaki.

325
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,816
"SOUVENIR"
She was brought to a hot spring hotel

326
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:19,788
by the cat she caught.

327
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:24,517
But the hot spring is simply too comfy.

328
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:29,908
She can feel it melting her.

329
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:36,006
Not too hot, not too warm.

330
00:21:36,007 --> 00:21:36,903
Perfectly balanced.

331
00:21:40,398 --> 00:21:42,516
The cherry blossoms are still blooming
in the courtyard.

332
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:44,496
Such a scenic view.

333
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:46,996
Can't agree more.

334
00:21:51,298 --> 00:21:52,716
Huh? Inuko!

335
00:21:53,107 --> 00:21:54,896
What are you doing here?

336
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:36,292
NEXT EPISODE: THE SCENERY FROM MEMORY LANE

337
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:36,941
WHEN ENJOYING CAMPING,
BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RULES

338
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:37,589
OF THE CAMPGROUND AND ITS FACILITIES.

339
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,697
DON'T FORGET TO PUT OUT YOUR CAMPFIRE
AND DISPOSE OF YOUR GARBAGE.

340
00:23:38,698 --> 00:23:39,885
TEMPERATURES CAN CHANGE QUICKLY,
SO CHECK THE WEATHER FORECAST BEFOREHAND.

341
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:41,098
WEAR WARM CLOTHING IF NECESSARY
TO PREVENT COLD.
