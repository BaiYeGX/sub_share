1
00:00:01,876 --> 00:00:04,170
The tent I got from Grandpa

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,589
is getting a bit old.

3
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,344
It's time for a solo camping trip.

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,971
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3
TRAILER

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,264
Gleam!

6
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,849
Just cut the aluminium can
in half and stuff it in,

7
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,892
that should do the trick.

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,646
She's really full of energy.

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,232
It's been a while, Rin.

10
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,318
Didn't expect Aya to be so laid-back.

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,571
Want to try it out at my place?

12
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,197
Backyard camping or a day camp,

13
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,991
it's a first for me.

14
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,453
It's starting to get light.

15
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:38,788
It's nice to see

16
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,248
the sun rising.

17
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,543
Nadeshiko,

18
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,503
what are you taking a picture of?

19
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,130
Oi River Camp?

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,757
Roger that!

21
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:55,847
Riding a 50cc motorcycle to Izu,

22
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,474
Rin's definitely an eccentric one.

23
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,809
Is this a new item?

24
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,352
It's something I bought recently.

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,855
You two, hold her down for me.

26
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,523
No, don't!

27
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,357
FROM WINTER TO SPRING

28
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,319
A dish with a playful touch is superb!

29
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,320
Open the gate!

30
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,239
I can't see the exit at all!

31
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,365
TAKE A NEW STEP

32
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,451
Camping in Izu together.

33
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,994
Camping in the backyard together.

34
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,120
Nadeshiko,

35
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,164
where should we go next time?

36
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:25,001
Laid-back Camp Season 3
