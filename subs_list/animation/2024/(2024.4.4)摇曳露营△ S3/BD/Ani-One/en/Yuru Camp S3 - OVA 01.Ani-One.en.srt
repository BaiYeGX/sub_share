1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

2
00:00:01,486 --> 00:00:04,548
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES CLUB CLUBROOM

3
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:05,674
THE PERFECT CUP OF COFFEE

4
00:00:05,675 --> 00:00:07,881
Making your own coffee while camping

5
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,689
sounds cool.

6
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,283
I'd like to try it once in my life.

7
00:00:25,878 --> 00:00:27,173
Please enjoy.

8
00:00:27,174 --> 00:00:28,274
Why soba?

9
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:38,073
What's up, Aki?

10
00:00:38,586 --> 00:00:43,407
As we all know,
Lake Yamanaka looks like a roast chicken.

11
00:00:43,784 --> 00:00:45,926
You made that up.

12
00:00:45,927 --> 00:00:46,973
But actually,

13
00:00:46,974 --> 00:00:50,432
after investigating the other four lakes
of the Fuji Five Lakes (Fuji Goko),

14
00:00:51,182 --> 00:00:54,090
I discovered something astonishing!

15
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:56,297
Lake Motosu looks like fried chicken!

16
00:00:57,193 --> 00:00:59,183
Lake Shoji looks like a chicken wing!

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,079
Western Lake looks like
half a deep-fried chicken!

18
00:01:02,683 --> 00:01:04,792
Lake Kawaguchi, on the other hand,
looks like chicken with spicy sauce!

19
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:07,979
That's right. It's even more apparent
when you put them together!

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,286
The shape of the Fuji Five Lakes!

21
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:13,292
They all look like chicken dishes!

22
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:17,781
I think Lake Kawaguchi is a stretch…

23
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,379
"FUJI CHICKEN GOKO"
So from now on,

24
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,077
"FUJI CHICKEN GOKO"
the Five Lakes should be promoted

25
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:23,984
as "Fuji Chicken Goko," each offering
its own local chicken dish

26
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:26,286
to boost the local economy!

27
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,426
Agreed!

28
00:01:27,427 --> 00:01:29,989
I want to eat Lake Motosu fried chicken!

29
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,891
All this talk about chicken
is making me hungry.

30
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:41,063
There are two types of campers.

31
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:44,891
There's the type
that gains more equipment…

32
00:01:44,892 --> 00:01:47,166
What should I bring with me this time?

33
00:01:47,167 --> 00:01:48,687
Let's see…

34
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:49,896
Never mind.

35
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:52,483
…the more they go camping.

36
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,277
"MAXIMALIST CAMPER"
I'll just bring everything.

37
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:56,886
This is too heavy.

38
00:01:56,887 --> 00:01:58,288
Won't be needing this.

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:59,290
Or this.

40
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,491
"MINIMALIST CAMPER"
And the type that does the opposite.

41
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:04,589
That does happen.

42
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,173
The former ends up having

43
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:08,074
to drive a big car

44
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:10,386
to carry everything.

45
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:12,480
While the latter finds camping

46
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:15,095
increasingly difficult
due to too little gear.

47
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:16,075
Gulp.

48
00:02:16,076 --> 00:02:18,091
Then, when they take to the extreme…

49
00:02:18,092 --> 00:02:19,887
They end up like this!

50
00:02:22,762 --> 00:02:25,181
Let's bring everything!

51
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:27,762
Maximalist Camper LV.100

52
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:34,293
Minimalist Camper LV.100

53
00:02:34,887 --> 00:02:38,079
I ought to be careful not to overdo it!

54
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,571
Yeah.

55
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:40,882
There's no way that's going to happen.

56
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,290
"HOME, ENA'S PLACE, MINOBU STATION, SCHOOL"
Looks like

57
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:50,094
"RIN'S PLACE, HOTTODAKE HOT SPRINGS, BUDOU"
I've still got a lot

58
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,181
"RIN'S PLACE, HOTTODAKE HOT SPRINGS, BUDOU"
to learn about Yamanashi.

59
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,792
Nadeshiko's map of Yamanashi.

60
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:57,792
It's too half-baked.

61
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:59,876
She's only been here for half a year.

62
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:01,298
It can't be helped.

63
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:02,475
That said,

64
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:04,792
she kind of got the gist.

65
00:03:04,793 --> 00:03:08,276
No… that Budou is way too big.

66
00:03:08,277 --> 00:03:11,286
Her Yatsugatake area
gobbled up a place or two or more too.

67
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:12,776
What about your map, Inuko?

68
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:14,277
Mine…

69
00:03:14,899 --> 00:03:16,397
looks something like this.

70
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:17,837
"CITY AREA, FRUITS AREA"
Inuko's map

71
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:19,489
"RESIDENTIAL AREA, MT. MINOBU AREA"
of Yamanashi.

72
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:23,156
Oh, yes, yes. This is it!

73
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:26,099
"ENTRANCE TO SHIZUOKA"
Since Nambu is close to Shizuoka,

74
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,662
it does feel like an entrance.

75
00:03:27,664 --> 00:03:28,590
MT. FUJI

76
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:31,081
I really hope I can live
in the Mt. Fuji area someday!

77
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,683
"MINAMI-ALPS, HOT SPRINGS"
Oh, right.

78
00:03:32,684 --> 00:03:35,890
There are many hot springs
around the Minami-Alps area.

79
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:37,588
YATSUGATAKE

80
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:40,485
I didn't know there were
so many campsites in Yatsugatake.

81
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:41,578
ENTRANCE TO CHICHIBU

82
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:44,084
The eastern side of the basin
is far from Minobu,

83
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:46,287
so I don't know that area very well.

84
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:46,848
ENTRANCE TO SAGAMIHARA

85
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:49,485
I want to visit there
with everyone someday.

86
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,485
THE BIRTHPLACE OF THE INUYAMA CLAN

87
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:55,481
The birthplace of the Inuyama clan!?

88
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,297
You found out, after all.

89
00:03:58,298 --> 00:04:00,584
Well, you wrote it right there.

90
00:04:02,884 --> 00:04:05,266
That is Shiotsu New Town,

91
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:07,078
near Kanagawa and Tokyo.

92
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,683
It's a satellite city built in Uenohara.

93
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:11,985
It was also a ninja village

94
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,392
where the Inuyama clan lived
until the end of the Sengoku period.

95
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,578
A ninja village?

96
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:21,281
But after the Warring States period ended,

97
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:23,584
my clan decided to leave this land.

98
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:28,584
It is said that to never forget
that this was where we originated,

99
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:30,886
my ancestors shaped the mountain
into the form of a dog

100
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:33,094
to remember this history.

101
00:04:33,095 --> 00:04:36,880
When you put it like that,
it does kind of look like a dog.

102
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:40,880
Later, houses were gradually
built on this shaped land,

103
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,084
eventually forming Shiotsu New Town.

104
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:49,283
How do you think
Aoi came up with these stories?

105
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:56,172
Tall tales need to be surprising
and realistic at the same time.

106
00:04:56,173 --> 00:04:59,490
They should make everyone enjoy them,

107
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:00,171
and they must be

108
00:05:00,172 --> 00:05:03,386
the kind of stories that no one gets hurt
even if they are fooled.

109
00:05:03,986 --> 00:05:06,578
It makes me cry just thinking about

110
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:09,771
Inuko writing down
her tall tales passionately

111
00:05:09,772 --> 00:05:11,677
in her notebook every night!

112
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,979
Let's just go along with it.

113
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,871
Let's allow ourselves
to be fooled forever.
