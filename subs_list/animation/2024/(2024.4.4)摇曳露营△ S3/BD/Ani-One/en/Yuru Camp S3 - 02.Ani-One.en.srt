1
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:51,297
Eating outdoors

2
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:53,995
is the essence of camping.

3
00:00:55,292 --> 00:00:56,818
Even though this is just hot cocoa.

4
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,313
It's lukewarm…

5
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:20,094
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

6
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:39,405
EPISODE 2: PETIT CAMP AND YARD CAMP

7
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:43,609
This won't hold the heat that much longer.

8
00:02:49,498 --> 00:02:50,401
Oh, this is…

9
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:55,198
the one Rin used.

10
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,708
It's pretty pricey.

11
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:04,698
3… 251 yen.

12
00:03:05,396 --> 00:03:06,401
Hmm. Can't afford it.

13
00:03:07,905 --> 00:03:09,395
Excuse me.

14
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:11,302
Yes, can I help you?

15
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,499
I'd like to heat up my drink.

16
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,604
Do you have any cheaper options?

17
00:03:17,394 --> 00:03:18,604
Well, in that case…

18
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:21,505
How about this?

19
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:24,995
What's this?

20
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:38,899
A pocket stove.

21
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,302
It's so cute and compact.

22
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:44,812
Just put in the solid fuel
and light it up.

23
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,313
Perfect for a little camping
with hot cocoa.

24
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:07,417
It's hot!

25
00:04:10,302 --> 00:04:13,104
Nothing beats piping hot cocoa.

26
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:23,007
See you next time, Aya!

27
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:24,805
Bye.

28
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:26,809
Rin,

29
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:30,094
when the weather gets a bit warmer,

30
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:31,199
I'll come down to Yamanashi.

31
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,386
I'll drive a motorcycle,

32
00:04:33,387 --> 00:04:35,002
just like you.

33
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:42,408
Motorcycle camping.

34
00:04:43,402 --> 00:04:44,804
If it's going on the bike,

35
00:04:44,804 --> 00:04:46,804
it has to be lightweight
and compact, right?

36
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:49,313
And easy to set up, too.

37
00:04:50,595 --> 00:04:51,790
"TENTS FOR MOTORCYCLE CAMPING,"
Mountain climbing tents?

38
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,793
"MOUNTAINEERING TENTS"
Mountain climbing tents?

39
00:04:53,397 --> 00:04:56,101
Stuff from the big brands sure is pricey.

40
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:58,210
Is there anything cheaper?

41
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:00,547
"SUPER CHEAP MOUNTAIN CLIMBING"
980 yen?

42
00:05:00,549 --> 00:05:01,384
"OUTDOOR DOME TENT"
980 yen?

43
00:05:01,398 --> 00:05:02,695
What's with the crazy price gap?

44
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:05,309
Looks like it'll collapse
at the slightest breeze though.

45
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,705
Oh, right.

46
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:14,705
This one looks pretty decent.

47
00:05:19,007 --> 00:05:20,611
We're here…

48
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,511
Welcome, girls!

49
00:05:24,512 --> 00:05:26,408
Morning, Ena!

50
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,236
Morning.

51
00:05:27,237 --> 00:05:30,007
Fresh out of the bed, huh?

52
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:36,381
A heartfelt reunion.

53
00:05:36,382 --> 00:05:39,850
Chikuwa!

54
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:49,507
It must be cold outside, huh?

55
00:05:50,896 --> 00:05:51,902
Sorry.

56
00:05:51,903 --> 00:05:54,403
I'll get changed.
You girls go ahead and set up the tent.

57
00:05:54,793 --> 00:05:55,897
Okay!

58
00:05:58,512 --> 00:06:00,384
The girls set to work immediately

59
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,705
and completed the task in no time.

60
00:06:02,706 --> 00:06:04,007
All done!

61
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:07,304
Aoi, a new camping item?

62
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:10,017
"PORTABLE COMPACT TABLE, 4000 YEN"
I placed an order.

63
00:06:10,018 --> 00:06:11,513
"PORTABLE COMPACT TABLE, 4000 YEN"
right after we came back from Izu.

64
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:15,507
I've been looking for a colour
that matched my chair.

65
00:06:15,996 --> 00:06:17,595
Nifty and spiffy.

66
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:19,803
The surface is fabric,

67
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:23,012
but it's got an aluminium board inside.
It looks pretty durable.

68
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:25,595
It sure does.

69
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:28,106
White gets dirty easily,

70
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,507
but I'll do my best
to use it with caution.

71
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:34,106
We are in your care.

72
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,117
Sorry to keep you guys waiting.

73
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:38,497
I'll set up Chikuwa's tent right away.

74
00:06:38,996 --> 00:06:39,695
Wait.

75
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,507
Not yet.

76
00:06:45,795 --> 00:06:46,497
Go ahead!

77
00:06:48,595 --> 00:06:49,991
How cute!

78
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:50,886
DOG TENT 10,000 YEN

79
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:51,512
DOG COT 10,000 YEN

80
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:52,476
DOG SLEEPING BAG 15,000 YEN

81
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:53,788
CHIKUWA'S CAMPING SET
TOTAL: 35,000 YEN

82
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,710
Those are some dear prices!

83
00:06:57,202 --> 00:06:59,705
Dog camping equipment isn't cheap.

84
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,713
But if the quality lives up to the price,

85
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,299
it should last longer.

86
00:07:04,898 --> 00:07:05,907
That's true.

87
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:09,095
I've only used
my super-cheap tent a couple of times,

88
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,111
but the underside's already worn out.

89
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:14,100
Plus, one of the poles snapped

90
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,190
the first time we tried setting it up.

91
00:07:16,794 --> 00:07:19,007
But thanks to that broken pole,

92
00:07:19,007 --> 00:07:22,507
we became friends with Rin and Ena.

93
00:07:22,894 --> 00:07:23,913
When you think about it like that,

94
00:07:23,914 --> 00:07:27,398
doesn't it feel like the tent
has already paid off big time?

95
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:29,902
Aoi, you said it perfectly!

96
00:07:29,903 --> 00:07:31,596
That's so true!

97
00:07:32,007 --> 00:07:33,298
Side note,

98
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:36,101
it wasn't easy to find a cot
that fit inside the tent.

99
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:38,096
I was finally able to get one
at a second-hand store.

100
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:40,507
Sure is a lot of work…

101
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:44,512
You are dearly loved, Chikuwa.

102
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:51,798
We're camping in Ena's yard! Woof!

103
00:07:52,897 --> 00:07:55,898
Chikuwa in a tent, so cute.

104
00:07:57,606 --> 00:07:58,602
Now, then…

105
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:01,512
Time to give Aki a haircut.

106
00:08:01,897 --> 00:08:03,397
I'm in your hands.

107
00:08:03,804 --> 00:08:05,804
So, what kind of hairstyle
are we getting today?

108
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:10,293
Well, I was thinking about having the sides
and the back cut to about shoulder length.

109
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:15,012
Might as well make it shorter
and go for a "cool" look.

110
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:17,496
A cool girl, huh?

111
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:20,793
Cool? Something like this?

112
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,793
No, not that kind of cool!

113
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:28,012
I think a cute style
would suit Aki better!

114
00:08:28,287 --> 00:08:30,791
Something fluffy and cute

115
00:08:30,792 --> 00:08:32,804
would suit Aki perfectly.

116
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,402
Cute's not my thing.

117
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:37,606
Nah…

118
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:38,798
How about this?

119
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,200
No, although it does look cute and fluffy…

120
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:43,595
In that case, let's do the right side cool

121
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:45,402
and the left side cute.

122
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:46,507
Please don't.

123
00:08:46,897 --> 00:08:51,405
Still, I think there's nothing more Aki
than the exposed forehead.

124
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,193
Original is the best, after all.

125
00:08:55,194 --> 00:08:56,409
That's right.

126
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,606
I think the exposed forehead
suits Aki the best too.

127
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:02,891
Forget exposed forehead!

128
00:09:02,892 --> 00:09:05,199
If you use that thing,
my scalp will be showing!

129
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:07,693
You two, hold her down for me.

130
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:09,798
Wait! Seriously?

131
00:09:10,194 --> 00:09:13,705
No, don't!

132
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,100
You're looking fresh.

133
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:18,407
I didn't plan on keeping my hair long,

134
00:09:18,408 --> 00:09:21,908
but it feels like losing a piece of myself
with it cut short.

135
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:23,387
You'll get used to it

136
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:24,900
in no time.

137
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:27,126
I still think it has to be
the exposed forehead for Aki.

138
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:28,192
You're still on that?

139
00:09:31,601 --> 00:09:33,798
Now that Aki's haircut is done,

140
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:35,783
let's begin the barbecue.

141
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,194
I've been waiting to hear that!

142
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:39,861
"ALCOHOL FUEL"
What kind of sausages

143
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:41,204
"ALCOHOL FUEL"
did you bring, Nadeshiko?

144
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,304
"SUPER SPICY CHORIZO"
This kind.

145
00:09:43,608 --> 00:09:44,893
"YAMANASHI PORK, HERB AND LEMON SAUSAGES"
I bought this.

146
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,897
"SUPER TASTY CHEESY FISH CAKES"
I brought this.

147
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:49,013
Does that count as a sausage?

148
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:51,882
"YUMMY CHICKEN BREAST SAUSAGE! YUM! WOOF!"
And Chikuwa's favourite.

149
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:56,007
You like that, Chikuwa?

150
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:58,002
What about you, Aki?

151
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:02,256
I brought this!

152
00:10:02,257 --> 00:10:03,803
ON SALE, DOMESTIC GROUND PORK, 398 YEN

153
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:05,111
Ground pork?

154
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,501
Weren't you the one who said
to bring only sausages?

155
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:11,710
Okay. Hold your horses…

156
00:10:12,293 --> 00:10:13,080
"SAUSAGE CASING"
I'm going to use this

157
00:10:13,392 --> 00:10:14,804
and this

158
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:18,523
to make my own sausages!

159
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:21,703
Make your own sausages?

160
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:22,986
SAUSAGE STUFFER, CASING

161
00:10:22,986 --> 00:10:25,704
Homemade sausages? That sounds exciting!

162
00:10:25,705 --> 00:10:27,903
When did you even get these?

163
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:31,087
My mum bought this years ago.

164
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,200
She never used it.
It's been left to collect dust.

165
00:10:33,496 --> 00:10:34,600
Are you sure it's still good?

166
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:35,908
Wouldn't it have gone bad by now?

167
00:10:35,908 --> 00:10:37,606
I'm not talking about the ground pork!

168
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,605
But are sausages really that easy to make?

169
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:44,106
The recipe doesn't seem too difficult.

170
00:10:44,397 --> 00:10:48,188
Just season the meat with spices and salt,

171
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:50,106
mix well and put it
in the sausage stuffer…

172
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,996
Aoi!

173
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,788
You can't escape either.

174
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:07,012
You're next.

175
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,699
Impressive!

176
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:22,001
It's amazing how well-trained Chikuwa is.

177
00:11:23,801 --> 00:11:25,001
That's not all my Chikuwa

178
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:26,497
can do.

179
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:37,699
Zombie dog?

180
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Aki…

181
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:47,706
Aki…

182
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,804
Let… Let me go!

183
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:55,490
Aki…

184
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:57,892
Ena's dad's been watching us all along!

185
00:11:59,304 --> 00:12:02,101
Stare…

186
00:12:03,007 --> 00:12:06,215
SHIPPED, IN TRANSIT, OUT FOR DELIVERY

187
00:12:07,891 --> 00:12:08,809
It's here.

188
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:13,304
My tent

189
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,715
has arrived.

190
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,606
That was easier than I expected.

191
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:43,298
IT'S BEEN A WHILE, RIN.

192
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:44,501
Who's this?

193
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:46,007
SORRY, BUT WHO IS THIS?

194
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:46,616
OH, SORRY. IT'S AYANO.

195
00:12:46,617 --> 00:12:48,402
WE MET AT NADESHIKO'S
GRANDMA'S HOUSE DURING THE NEW YEAR'S.

196
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:51,085
OH, IT'S YOU, AYA.
LONG TIME NO SEE. WHAT'S UP?

197
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:51,512
I BOUGHT A TENT AND SLEEPING BAG TOO.

198
00:12:51,513 --> 00:12:53,513
THE WEATHER'S TURNED WARM, SO I FIGURED
I'D GO ON A CAMPING TRIP WITH MY MOTORCYCLE.

199
00:12:53,514 --> 00:12:54,329
WANT TO JOIN ME?

200
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:54,866
MOTORCYCLE CAMPING? SOUNDS NICE.

201
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,522
HAVE YOU DECIDED WHERE TO GO?

202
00:13:00,017 --> 00:13:00,906
120KM IS QUITE FAR.

203
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:01,454
SINCE IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME
TRAVELLING SO FAR,

204
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:02,000
I SUGGEST CHOOSING
SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO YOUR HOME.

205
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,000
BUT THAT'S A NORMAL TRIP FOR YOU, RIGHT?

206
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:03,959
BESIDES, I'LL BE DRIVING. IT'LL BE OKAY.

207
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,303
ARE YOU SURE?

208
00:13:05,304 --> 00:13:07,835
THEN, WE'LL CHOOSE SOMEWHERE NEARBY.
I'LL GET IN TOUCH AGAIN CLOSER TO THE DATE.

209
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:10,803
GOT IT. I'LL BE WAITING.

210
00:13:10,804 --> 00:13:11,903
Though…

211
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:13,604
LET'S CHOOSE A SPOT HALFWAY BETWEEN
WHERE WE LIVE!

212
00:13:13,605 --> 00:13:14,007
ABOUT A 120KM DRIVE

213
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:16,517
Didn't expect Aya to be so laid-back.

214
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:19,903
What about Nadeshiko?

215
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:23,309
Welcome.

216
00:13:27,194 --> 00:13:29,803
Let's get back on track
and begin the sausage making.

217
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,156
First, add spices and salt
to the ground meat,

218
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:35,513
mix, and knead until it becomes sticky.

219
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:39,699
Then, add okra, natto,
and Egyptian spinach

220
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,304
to make the meat filling stickier.

221
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:43,413
Don't add random stuff!

222
00:13:43,414 --> 00:13:46,210
Then, cut the casing
to the required length

223
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,902
and slide it onto the metal tube
of the sausage stuffer,

224
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:51,507
tying the front end.

225
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:53,501
It looks like shedded snake skin…

226
00:13:53,502 --> 00:13:55,502
Hey, stop right there.

227
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,408
Next, stuff the prepared meat filling
into the sausage stuffer.

228
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,292
To prevent air from entering the sausages,

229
00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:03,095
fill the casing
with just the right amount of filling.

230
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,610
100% PORK SAUSAGE (UNCOOKED)

231
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,901
Once the meat filling is stuffed,
tie the back end of the casing.

232
00:14:07,902 --> 00:14:11,099
Then, divide it into sections
according to preference, and it's done.

233
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,907
How's that?

234
00:14:12,908 --> 00:14:15,116
It looks great.

235
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:17,209
That was easy!

236
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,106
Right?

237
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:20,595
Let's fry them up, Aki.

238
00:14:25,891 --> 00:14:28,267
Oh, right. Got to set this up first.

239
00:14:28,595 --> 00:14:30,512
Huh? Isn't that…

240
00:14:31,798 --> 00:14:35,293
It's the kitchen rack you used
as a mini table at the Christmas camp.

241
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:38,204
Can't put the frying pan directly
on top of the alcohol stove.

242
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:42,011
You really know how to make the most
out of that kitchen rack.

243
00:14:42,296 --> 00:14:45,298
Well, let's get started.

244
00:14:49,407 --> 00:14:51,595
As expected, not quite enough fire.

245
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,095
Let's dump the meat in.

246
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,506
That's too many…

247
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,604
It's sizzling!

248
00:15:04,605 --> 00:15:05,903
Even though we're just
frying some sausages

249
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:09,006
with the skillets, this is pretty nice.

250
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:10,298
Uh-huh.

251
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:14,011
I've washed and seasoned them
with olive oil.

252
00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:15,996
Stuff don't stick or burn easily anymore.

253
00:15:15,997 --> 00:15:17,403
They're great to use.

254
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:21,209
You're a "well-seasoned" chef
with how much care you put into your wares.

255
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,604
Aki, I think they're done.

256
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:24,907
Oh, you're right.

257
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:28,405
Aki, can I try one now?

258
00:15:28,413 --> 00:15:30,715
Get them while they're hot!

259
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,902
Time to dig in!

260
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,605
The herb sausage is done.

261
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,204
The chorizo needs a little more time.

262
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,762
At least say something about it!
You guys are scaring me…

263
00:15:47,397 --> 00:15:48,896
Um, well…

264
00:15:48,897 --> 00:15:50,897
You should try one too.

265
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:02,792
The chorizo has a nice spicy kick to it!

266
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:04,704
She's using the chorizo
as a palate cleanser!

267
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,199
I mean, it's not that bad…

268
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:11,006
Could use a little more fat…

269
00:16:11,006 --> 00:16:13,610
Tastes rustic.

270
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:15,913
Don't bother sugarcoating anything.
It's disgusting.

271
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:18,402
Exactly, Aki.

272
00:16:20,292 --> 00:16:21,621
Why?

273
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:24,900
It was such a simple recipe!
Where did I go wrong?

274
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:26,897
Aki, look at this.

275
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:28,105
Take note!

276
00:16:28,105 --> 00:16:31,792
The ground meat must be kept
in the freezer before use.

277
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:35,308
The same goes for the sausage stuffer
and the mixing bowl.

278
00:16:35,309 --> 00:16:37,099
When preparing the meat mixture,

279
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,501
to prevent the ground meat from being
affected by the temperature of the hand,

280
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:43,907
please add crushed ice to the processor

281
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:45,595
to keep the temperature low.

282
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:47,704
It says that if the temperature
of the meat is too high,

283
00:16:47,704 --> 00:16:49,901
the lean and fatty parts won't mix well,

284
00:16:49,902 --> 00:16:51,714
and the stuffing will dry out.

285
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,668
So, that's why…

286
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:55,906
The steps are simple,

287
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:58,006
but it's strict on temperature control.

288
00:16:58,801 --> 00:17:00,196
I don't want to waste all that meat.

289
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:03,699
I'll bring it home
and make some minced meat out of it.

290
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,803
Don't beat yourself up over it, Aki.

291
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,001
Are you comforting me, Chikuwa?

292
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:17,705
Eh?

293
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:25,808
"LEASH"
Oh, you just wanted to go on a walk.

294
00:17:27,008 --> 00:17:29,111
Let's go on a walk, then.

295
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,584
Bring the chairs too.

296
00:17:30,585 --> 00:17:31,403
Chairs?

297
00:17:54,496 --> 00:17:56,210
This place is swell.

298
00:17:57,308 --> 00:18:00,199
Makes me wish we had some manjus.

299
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:08,397
Our DIY alcohol stoves
came in handier than I expected.

300
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:12,157
Yeah, using the stuff you made
by yourself is pretty nice.

301
00:18:13,117 --> 00:18:17,121
Aki, any other things we can DIY?

302
00:18:18,908 --> 00:18:21,094
How about we make some leather crafts?

303
00:18:21,095 --> 00:18:24,199
We can use them as covers
for the cooking gas cans and bags.

304
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:26,604
Good idea. Sounds stylish.

305
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:28,194
And

306
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,704
we can carve chopsticks and spoons
out of wood.

307
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,391
Great idea!

308
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,699
That could come in handy in a situation…

309
00:18:35,688 --> 00:18:36,782
I forgot the chopsticks.

310
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:37,798
Leave it to me!

311
00:18:39,194 --> 00:18:40,594
There we go, Rin!

312
00:18:40,595 --> 00:18:41,407
Amazing.

313
00:18:41,407 --> 00:18:43,115
It'd be so cool if we could do that.

314
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:49,907
You smell so nice, Chikuwa.

315
00:18:53,001 --> 00:18:55,402
It's cherry blossom season soon.

316
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:56,912
Should we go flower viewing together?

317
00:18:57,506 --> 00:18:58,808
That sounds nice.

318
00:18:58,808 --> 00:19:00,095
I'm in!

319
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,610
An outdoor activities club
flower viewing camp!

320
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:05,506
A flower viewing camp sounds neat.

321
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:09,194
Are there any campsites around here
suitable for flower viewing?

322
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:13,209
There are cherry blossoms
around Lake Shibire and Lake Tanuki.

323
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:15,402
But it won't be a pleasant camping trip

324
00:19:15,402 --> 00:19:16,779
if everyone else had the same idea

325
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,017
and we all end up

326
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:20,292
at an overcrowded lake.

327
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,694
True.

328
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:26,209
Find a hidden gem where we can enjoy
the cherry blossoms in peace

329
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:28,406
or just go flower viewing,

330
00:19:28,407 --> 00:19:29,897
we'll have to choose.

331
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:35,100
What do you think, Chikuwa?

332
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:44,308
Take care on your way back, everybody.

333
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:45,996
Bye.

334
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:48,605
See you again soon, Chikuwa.

335
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:50,912
"HEATED FLOORING"
The house has heated flooring.

336
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:53,297
Chikuwa's already asleep.

337
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:55,121
He's been completely domesticated.

338
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,611
Bye!

339
00:19:59,803 --> 00:20:02,897
The days are getting longer.

340
00:20:03,508 --> 00:20:05,703
It's almost spring.

341
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:06,912
Yeah.

342
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:11,408
Bye, you two.

343
00:20:12,199 --> 00:20:13,308
See you.

344
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,699
SOLO, BOUND FOR KOFU

345
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:27,387
I went to Izu with everyone

346
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:28,694
and had my first yard camp today.

347
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:31,799
Maybe I should go solo camping again?

348
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:39,621
It's time for a solo camp.

349
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:44,913
It's Aya.

350
00:20:45,334 --> 00:20:46,906
NADESHIKO, YOU, ME, AND RIN!
LET'S GO CAMPING TOGETHER!

351
00:20:46,907 --> 00:20:48,292
IN OIGAWA!

352
00:20:48,902 --> 00:20:50,206
Oigawa?

353
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,012
Good work today.

354
00:20:55,303 --> 00:20:57,298
I'm down for the Oigawa camp!

355
00:20:58,095 --> 00:20:58,906
Okay.

356
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,010
Great.

357
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:02,204
But why Oigawa?

358
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:04,605
It'd be difficult if we chose a location

359
00:21:04,605 --> 00:21:06,011
that wasn't somewhere midpoint.

360
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,390
So, I did some research

361
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:10,298
and found out that Oikawa
happened to be somewhere in between.

362
00:21:10,715 --> 00:21:14,188
We're planning
to drive around Oigawa first

363
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:16,095
before heading to the campsite.

364
00:21:16,601 --> 00:21:18,696
You'll be on your own
until then, is that okay?

365
00:21:18,704 --> 00:21:20,105
No problem…

366
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:25,101
I was just thinking about
going on a solo camp.

367
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,908
I'll enjoy it as a solo camp.

368
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:30,918
So, solo camp.

369
00:21:30,918 --> 00:21:33,204
So, solo camp solo.

370
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,402
And I'll be bringing that hamburg steak.

371
00:21:38,402 --> 00:21:39,793
Look forward to it.

372
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,283
Really? Yay!

373
00:21:42,795 --> 00:21:44,209
Hamburg steak?

374
00:21:51,053 --> 00:21:52,313
I'm back.

375
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:36,601
NEXT EPISODE: BRIDGE COUNTRY

376
00:23:36,602 --> 00:23:37,206
WHEN ENJOYING CAMPING,
BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RULES

377
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:37,810
OF THE CAMPGROUND AND ITS FACILITIES.

378
00:23:37,811 --> 00:23:39,003
DON'T FORGET TO PUT OUT YOUR CAMPFIRE
AND DISPOSE OF YOUR GARBAGE.

379
00:23:39,004 --> 00:23:40,210
TEMPERATURES CAN CHANGE QUICKLY,
SO CHECK THE WEATHER FORECAST BEFOREHAND.

380
00:23:40,216 --> 00:23:41,216
WEAR WARM CLOTHING IF NECESSARY
TO PREVENT COLD.
