00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,099
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

2
00:01:31,589 --> 00:01:33,410
EPISODE 8:
THE ONSLAUGHT OF MOUTH-WATERING FOOD!!

3
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:35,994
Hello, everyone. This is Aoi Inuyama.

4
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:38,603
We had a great time
at the yakitori place

5
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:40,400
and missed the bus,

6
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:43,000
so we changed our route
and took the mountain road.

7
00:01:43,698 --> 00:01:44,994
Despite the many obstacles along the way,

8
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:46,999
the Bus Campers made it

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,396
to Mount Mizugaki campsite.

10
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:53,697
What will become of the bags
full of blemished tomatoes?

11
00:01:53,698 --> 00:01:56,697
Will Nadeshiko be able to resist
our mouth-watering food attack?

12
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:59,307
And is Hanpen really a dog that exists?

13
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,297
We shall find out
in the second part of the half-reality,

14
00:02:03,298 --> 00:02:04,703
half-fiction Mizugaki Camp.

15
00:02:06,698 --> 00:02:08,048
BUS CAMP

16
00:02:08,054 --> 00:02:11,255
MEMOIRS OF THE CAMP OF THE LEFT-BEHIND
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES CLUB MEMBERS

17
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,400
If only I'd ordered it earlier!

18
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:15,698
This yakitori is amazing!

19
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,099
But there's one more thing.

20
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:21,198
Come on, eat it while it's hot.

21
00:02:21,604 --> 00:02:22,896
It's nice, isn't it?

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,802
Can't we just have
a nice, peaceful night by the campfire?

23
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:32,906
SATURDAY, 21 MARCH 20XX
4:12 PM MOUNT MIZUGAKI CAMP

24
00:02:36,807 --> 00:02:39,103
I think it's the landmark?

25
00:02:39,104 --> 00:02:42,588
Campsites with such beautiful scenery
are truly amazing.

26
00:02:42,589 --> 00:02:43,994
I get it.

27
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:46,608
Places like mountains or the sea,
even cityscapes are nice too.

28
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:49,499
Mount Mizugaki is famous for hiking,

29
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,693
but it has many rock climbing spots too.

30
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,499
Near the summit,
there's a prominent rock called

31
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,593
"Oyasuri Rock."

32
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:00,598
Greetings!

33
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,707
People actually climb that rock face.

34
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:06,692
Climbing such a dangerous place, wow!

35
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:11,296
I'm good just admiring it from afar.

36
00:03:11,297 --> 00:03:13,599
Same.

37
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,693
But the view from up there

38
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,412
must be spectacular.

39
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,074
How about buying a drone?

40
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,187
It could just fly to the summit in a snap.

41
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:24,796
If you buy something that expensive,

42
00:03:24,797 --> 00:03:26,603
you'll bleed again.

43
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:29,796
"CURRENT LOCATION"
But this campsite is so secluded.

44
00:03:29,797 --> 00:03:31,509
"TENT"
How did you find it?

45
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,312
While I was looking
at geological sites in Izu,

46
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,499
I got interested in National Parks,

47
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,890
"MIZUGAKI CAMPSITE"
so I browsed around on Guruguru Map.

48
00:03:37,891 --> 00:03:41,588
"CHICHIBU-TAMA-KAI NATIONAL PARK"
I discovered this campsite by chance

49
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,308
while exploring the surroundings
of Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park.

50
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:47,600
Since the weather is getting warmer,

51
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:51,604
we might try camping
a bit further north from now on.

52
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,312
That sounds good.

53
00:03:55,494 --> 00:03:57,791
It's almost 5 PM.

54
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:59,369
Ms. Toba is so slow.

55
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,098
We can't even start dinner

56
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,494
since she has the pots and pans.

57
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:06,103
Exactly.

58
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:09,197
If Ms. Toba says,
"I can't make it after all,"

59
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:10,322
we're screwed.

60
00:04:10,323 --> 00:04:14,698
Then we'll have to munch on raw tomatoes.

61
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:18,499
Ms. Toba said
she'll be here in ten minutes.

62
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,301
We were just talking about her.

63
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:24,802
Well then, let's start preparing.

64
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,198
First,
let's wash and chop the ingredients.

65
00:04:30,104 --> 00:04:33,103
The biggest culinary assault
of the trip is about to begin.

66
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:34,000
Gulp.

67
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:38,000
Huh?

68
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:39,402
UNDER REPAIR. DO NOT USE.

69
00:04:39,403 --> 00:04:42,504
This campsite even has a pizza oven.

70
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:43,754
You're right.

71
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:45,984
But it's out of order.

72
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:47,593
Pizza…

73
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:52,759
If only I'd ordered it earlier!

74
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,604
What's up, Aki?

75
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:58,511
Well, actually back in Akeno…

76
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,901
"TOMATO CURRY"
Aki-chan, what do you want to eat?

77
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:04,504
The shop's recommendation

78
00:05:04,505 --> 00:05:07,192
"RECOMMENDED: CURRY FULL OF LOCAL VEGETABLES"
was the curry filled with local vegetables.

79
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:09,812
"PIZZA TOAST. TAKEAWAY"
But I also wanted to try the pizza toast.

80
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:10,895
But

81
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:13,593
just pizza toast wouldn't be enough.

82
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:17,098
But getting both would be too much.

83
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:20,307
"RECOMMENDED"
So, I went with the recommended dish.

84
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:23,807
So, I had curry.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,302
But I still wanted pizza.

86
00:05:28,797 --> 00:05:29,505
Pizza.

87
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:30,693
Pizza.

88
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:32,598
Pizza.

89
00:05:34,198 --> 00:05:36,702
So now, seeing the pizza oven

90
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,004
makes me really crave pizza!

91
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,015
So you've been craving pizza
since lunchtime.

92
00:05:42,016 --> 00:05:43,495
Yes!

93
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:48,006
"NAPOLI-STYLE PIZZA DOUGH"
Look what this is!

94
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,198
Is that… pizza dough?!

95
00:05:51,693 --> 00:05:54,483
That's right. We're making pizza today!

96
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:55,901
Pizza!

97
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,609
Awesome, I'm so excited!

98
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:01,301
But

99
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:03,088
isn't the pizza oven out of order today?

100
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:05,801
Don't worry… we've got that covered.

101
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:06,818
Yup, yup.

102
00:06:09,005 --> 00:06:10,994
Ms. Toba has arrived.

103
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,608
Sorry for being late.

104
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:20,301
No worries.
You've had a long trip, Ms. Toba.

105
00:06:20,302 --> 00:06:22,306
Thank you for coming all this way.

106
00:06:22,307 --> 00:06:24,989
Your luggage is in the trunk.

107
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,202
Please help yourselves to it.

108
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:27,802
Got it.

109
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:30,316
Now that we have the pots,

110
00:06:30,318 --> 00:06:32,088
let's start cooking, Aoi-chan.

111
00:06:32,089 --> 00:06:33,094
Alrighty.

112
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,890
Ms. Toba,

113
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:37,504
we bought some yakitori on our way here.

114
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,504
If you don't mind,
you can heat it up over the campfire

115
00:06:39,505 --> 00:06:41,510
for a snack while we prepare dinner.

116
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,401
Yakitori, you say?

117
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:48,906
I just happened to bring some sake
I bought in Izu.

118
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:52,088
Yakitori and sake go perfectly together.

119
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:53,495
Thank you very much.

120
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,202
Five minutes later.

121
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,801
This yakitori is amazing!

122
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,197
Even though I'm used to it,

123
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:00,989
she really does turn
into a different person entirely.

124
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,396
Goodbye, elegant Ms. Toba.

125
00:07:04,917 --> 00:07:06,591
Aki, what are you doing?

126
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,406
This is called cardboard smoking.

127
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,901
I've seen that in camping magazines!

128
00:07:11,902 --> 00:07:14,892
That's right.
I've wanted to try it for a while.

129
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,893
What are you going to smoke?

130
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,505
First, the usual: cheese, nuts,

131
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:20,798
and potato crisps.

132
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,818
But there's one more thing.

133
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,797
"AKI-CHAN'S SPECIAL HOMEMADE SAUSAGE"
Here it is, my treasured creation.

134
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:27,334
Ugh!

135
00:07:27,703 --> 00:07:29,693
-Hey, did you just go "ugh"?
-I need to go chop some wood.

136
00:07:29,694 --> 00:07:31,199
No…

137
00:07:31,808 --> 00:07:33,703
Don't worry.

138
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:37,495
I followed the recipe and made it again.

139
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:38,952
-Tonight is going to be
-Though I haven't

140
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:40,407
-the deadly sausage attack.
-tried it yet.

141
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,772
No… I have to brace myself.

142
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's make some camp dishes
with lots of tomatoes, Ena.

143
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:49,803
All right.

144
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:51,896
"TOMATO JUICE 100% TOMATO"
Let's start cooking.

145
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:54,490
First, add tomato juice to the tomatoes

146
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:57,897
and cook them in a pan
until they break down.

147
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:00,302
While the tomatoes are cooking,

148
00:08:00,303 --> 00:08:04,084
pour olive oil into another pan
with onions and garlic,

149
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:07,205
and sauté until golden brown.

150
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:11,173
Mana…

151
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,495
Then, add pork belly to the pan

152
00:08:13,496 --> 00:08:15,302
and continue to sauté.

153
00:08:15,303 --> 00:08:17,194
What spell are you chanting over there?

154
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:20,104
Once the pork is cooked,

155
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:23,099
add bay leaves, red wine, and water.

156
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:26,307
Let it simmer while skimming off the foam.

157
00:08:26,308 --> 00:08:28,897
My wine!

158
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,301
The tomatoes are ready.

159
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:34,797
Add the cooked tomatoes,
bouillon granules,

160
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:36,406
and salt to the pot,

161
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,917
and simmer until the volume is halved.

162
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,798
Be careful not to burn it while simmering.

163
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:43,001
Next, remove the bay leaves.

164
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:45,699
Add butter and simmer for a bit longer.

165
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,787
Then, put cabbage and carrots
into an empty frying pan and sauté.

166
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:51,798
Take out half once it's done.

167
00:08:53,103 --> 00:08:56,495
Add yakisoba noodles and water,
cover and steam,

168
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:58,896
then add powdered sauce and stir.

169
00:08:58,897 --> 00:09:01,104
Finally, pour the tomato sauce
from the pot over the noodles.

170
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,600
Sprinkle with parsley and grated cheese.

171
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:06,406
And there you have it:
Cheat Tomato Yakisoba,

172
00:09:06,407 --> 00:09:10,807
a dish using tomatoes
from other prefectures, ironically created

173
00:09:10,808 --> 00:09:16,698
to promote tomatoes from Chuo City,
Yamanashi Prefecture.

174
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:17,902
Complete!

175
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:20,215
It looks delicious,
but the name is a bit…

176
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:26,016
You don't often see yakisoba
with tomato sauce.

177
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:27,298
-Let's eat.
-I'm digging in.

178
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:30,365
Yum!

179
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:31,401
Delicious.

180
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:32,735
It's really good!

181
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,781
Delicious!

182
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:38,271
The tomato aroma is completely locked in.

183
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:39,292
This is awesome!

184
00:09:39,293 --> 00:09:43,402
This might be one of the best
camping dishes I've ever had.

185
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:47,423
By the way,

186
00:09:47,424 --> 00:09:50,453
why did Nadeshiko start
narrating halfway through?

187
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:51,594
"NADESHIKO'S DAD"
Because my family

188
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:54,509
"CHEAT TOMATO YAKISOBA"
put this recipe on "cook recipe".

189
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,803
So Nadeshiko's dad came up with the name?

190
00:09:56,804 --> 00:10:01,703
Everyone in Nadeshiko's family
writes recipes on the site.

191
00:10:01,704 --> 00:10:03,287
That's right.

192
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:05,001
As expected from the Kagamihara family.

193
00:10:05,797 --> 00:10:08,396
My dad writes some pretty weird recipes.

194
00:10:08,397 --> 00:10:11,400
Mum writes about everyday home cooking.

195
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,505
I write about dishes
I've made while camping.

196
00:10:13,506 --> 00:10:14,600
"MITARASHI DANGO ICE,"
Sakura writes about lazy recipes

197
00:10:14,601 --> 00:10:15,693
"PUT MITARASHI DANGO ON ICE"
Sakura writes about lazy recipes

198
00:10:15,694 --> 00:10:17,203
you can make in five minutes.

199
00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:20,201
Even Sakura's articles are lazy.

200
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,413
But they're really simple and tasty.

201
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:25,289
That was really good.

202
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,298
Makes you want to try making it at home.

203
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:30,408
Thanks for the compliments, everyone.

204
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,097
Alright, next up…

205
00:10:33,098 --> 00:10:35,286
Aki-chan's long-awaited pizza!

206
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:37,402
Time for pizza!

207
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:44,098
Finally, I can satisfy my pizza craving!

208
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:46,004
That's great, Aki-chan.

209
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:49,952
First, lightly fry the pizza dough
with a bit of olive oil.

210
00:10:49,953 --> 00:10:51,302
So exciting!

211
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:54,895
Then add cheese, cabbage,
bean sprouts, tempura bits,

212
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:56,697
and pork belly.

213
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,593
Next, pour in some flour
mixed with hot water.

214
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:00,906
So exciting…?

215
00:11:01,414 --> 00:11:05,094
In another pan,
stir-fry some noodles and fry up an egg.

216
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,301
Once the flour mixture sets,

217
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:09,588
place the pizza dough on the stir-fry

218
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:11,698
and press with a spatula.

219
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,150
Then put the dough and noodles on the egg

220
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:17,901
and press again with the spatula.

221
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:20,891
When the egg is cooked,
flip everything over.

222
00:11:21,507 --> 00:11:23,306
Sprinkle with pickled ginger and seaweed,

223
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:27,094
then drizzle with sauce and mayonnaise.

224
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,303
It turned into okonomiyaki!

225
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:41,408
If you put sake in the freezer,

226
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,010
it becomes cold but doesn't freeze.

227
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:46,105
This phenomenon is called "supercooling."

228
00:11:46,898 --> 00:11:49,907
In this state, pouring the sake
into a glass causes slight agitation,

229
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:55,588
leading the molecules to form

230
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,192
a slush-like consistency,

231
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:59,510
known as "sake granita."

232
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:04,693
It's nice to enjoy sake
this way occasionally,

233
00:12:08,302 --> 00:12:09,703
isn't it?

234
00:12:10,516 --> 00:12:12,904
Why does Ms. Toba look strange?

235
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:15,109
That's just how she usually looks.

236
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,390
I wanted to see elegant Ms. Toba

237
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:19,702
drinking in my memories.

238
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:22,792
But it feels a bit unsettling.

239
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,807
Let's go back to normal then.

240
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,307
The sake is delicious!

241
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:29,498
Good.

242
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,396
Trying the okonomiyaki
made with pizza dough.

243
00:12:38,103 --> 00:12:39,921
This is pretty good,

244
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:44,047
but I want pizza!

245
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,594
Settle down.

246
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:48,005
"NAPOLI-STYLE PIZZA DOUGH"
This pizza dough comes in a pack of three.

247
00:12:48,006 --> 00:12:49,103
Really?

248
00:12:49,104 --> 00:12:53,405
Next, let's use the dough as naan
to wrap minced meat curry and sausages.

249
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:54,406
Good idea.

250
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,823
Hey, stop that!

251
00:12:56,697 --> 00:12:59,703
How to make pizza in a frying pan.

252
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,207
First, cover the frying pan with a lid

253
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,494
and heat it on high.

254
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:09,010
Then, spread tomato sauce
over the pizza dough

255
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:13,395
and top with bacon,
asparagus, and capsicum.

256
00:13:13,396 --> 00:13:15,614
Add tomatoes and basil,

257
00:13:15,615 --> 00:13:17,823
and drizzle with mayonnaise.

258
00:13:17,824 --> 00:13:21,004
Finally, sprinkle with pizza cheese.

259
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:25,093
The frying pan will now
act like a pizza oven.

260
00:13:25,094 --> 00:13:27,004
To keep the heat inside,

261
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:30,198
open the lid slightly,
pour in a little olive oil,

262
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:32,807
and quickly slide the pizza into the pan.

263
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:38,511
Then, cook on low heat
until the cheese melts.

264
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:42,187
So you can create a pizza oven effect

265
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,829
with a frying pan by doing this.

266
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,504
Once the pizza is cooked,

267
00:13:47,505 --> 00:13:50,197
use a blowtorch
to slightly char the surface

268
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:52,205
and add a dash of black pepper.

269
00:13:53,107 --> 00:13:57,501
The slow-cooked
tomato sauce pizza is ready.

270
00:13:57,502 --> 00:13:59,087
It's pizza!

271
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:08,004
Rich tomato sauce with a buttery aroma,
topped with fresh tomatoes,

272
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:10,496
mayonnaise, and cheese…

273
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,213
This is it!

274
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:14,510
This is exactly what I wanted to eat!

275
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:15,686
Is it so good that you're crying?

276
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:18,099
Well, we did keep teasing her
and making her wait anxiously.

277
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,896
Why is Nadeshiko crying too?

278
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,112
Pizza-flavoured crisps are tasty,

279
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:28,908
but they're not pizza.

280
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:31,599
Well, that can't be helped.

281
00:14:32,302 --> 00:14:34,192
The pizza is perfectly cooked.

282
00:14:34,193 --> 00:14:35,395
It's really well done.

283
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:36,801
Thanks to the blowtorch.

284
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:38,807
The cheese aroma is fully released.

285
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:42,407
Oh, right.
Almost forgot about my smoking project.

286
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,306
Cardboard smoking.

287
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:46,999
After smoking for an hour,

288
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,572
let it sit in the box for another hour

289
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:50,802
to let the flavours develop.

290
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,787
It looks good.

291
00:14:54,684 --> 00:14:58,198
I didn't expect homemade smoking
to give such a nice colour.

292
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,098
The smoked nuts have a great texture!

293
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:07,004
The smoked potato crisps
are tasty too!

294
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:08,104
Right?

295
00:15:08,896 --> 00:15:12,911
The cheese has turned into a perfect
smoked cheese colour and looks really good!

296
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,985
Smoked food goes well with beer.

297
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,879
Ms. Toba seems to like it too.

298
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,302
Now for what you've all been waiting for…

299
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:33,188
Aki-chan's special homemade sausage,
smoked version!

300
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:36,400
It's… it's the deadly sausage attack…!

301
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:38,301
I… I forgot about this.

302
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:40,885
A… Aki, we can skip this one.

303
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:43,803
Don't be shy, I made enough for everyone.

304
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:49,297
Come on, eat it while it's hot.

305
00:15:54,395 --> 00:15:55,594
Ena!

306
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,193
Aoi-chan, this sausage is really good!

307
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,489
Oh, you're right.

308
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:19,310
It might not compare
to store-bought sausages,

309
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,594
but it's 100 times better than the ones
we made during our yard camping.

310
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:25,588
Hooray!

311
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:27,194
That's great, Aki-chan.

312
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,096
Now for the final dish.

313
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:33,004
Add water to the remaining tomato sauce,

314
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:35,187
then add the sautéed cabbage and carrots,

315
00:16:35,188 --> 00:16:39,010
boiled soybeans, and chopped tomatoes

316
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:40,506
to make minestrone.

317
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:44,911
Ending the chilly night at Mizugaki

318
00:16:44,912 --> 00:16:47,407
with a bowl of minestrone
really warms the body and soul.

319
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,312
Though,
it feels more like pork and bean stew

320
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:52,010
than minestrone.

321
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,407
Actually, the tomato yakisoba sauce
should have been made with minced meat.

322
00:16:54,408 --> 00:16:56,511
But I thought the minestrone

323
00:16:56,988 --> 00:17:01,394
would go better with pork belly,
so I made a little tweak.

324
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,489
You're so particular about the details.

325
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,890
It's amazing how we made three dishes

326
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,089
with the tomato sauce.

327
00:17:08,489 --> 00:17:09,182
However,

328
00:17:09,183 --> 00:17:11,202
even though we used so many tomatoes,

329
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:14,208
we still have two whole bags left.

330
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,998
We shouldn't have each packed a bag.

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,078
Seriously.

332
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:22,296
It's all because Aki-chan said
it'd be more fun if we all did it.

333
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:23,415
Goodness.

334
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:24,584
Hey, it was your idea!

335
00:17:27,802 --> 00:17:29,109
By the way,

336
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,306
I haven't seen Chikuwa for a while.

337
00:17:31,307 --> 00:17:32,300
Where'd Chikuwa go?

338
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,120
Huh?

339
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:38,098
You're right. Chikuwa?

340
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:40,499
Chikuwa!

341
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,996
Chikuwa!

342
00:17:41,997 --> 00:17:43,333
Chikuwa!

343
00:17:47,302 --> 00:17:49,485
Chikuwa ran into that little window!

344
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:54,801
It's so warm inside here!

345
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:55,599
It's just a memory,

346
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,301
but why are we outside here in the cold

347
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:58,999
like idiots?

348
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,702
Wait, Aki!

349
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,405
That's cheating!

350
00:18:01,406 --> 00:18:02,603
I want to go in too!

351
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:04,197
Then I want to go in too.

352
00:18:04,198 --> 00:18:06,109
Hey, don't push me!

353
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,896
I want to go in too!

354
00:18:17,298 --> 00:18:18,593
And so,

355
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:21,308
everyone except Hanpen ran inside.

356
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:23,906
My, my.

357
00:18:24,697 --> 00:18:28,505
Can't we just have
a nice, peaceful night by the campfire?

358
00:18:32,401 --> 00:18:34,896
The campfire feels so warm.

359
00:18:40,813 --> 00:18:44,807
But this is a splendid campsite.

360
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:47,890
Although it's not the most convenient

361
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:49,905
in terms of transportation,

362
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:53,214
that's what makes camping so leisurely.

363
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,796
So,

364
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:59,286
let's end the memories of Mizugaki here.

365
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,187
Since everyone has run off,

366
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:05,808
I'll wrap it up.

367
00:19:06,388 --> 00:19:08,301
"SUBSCRIBE"
Don't forget to like

368
00:19:08,302 --> 00:19:12,224
"HANPEN'S GOOD DAYS"
and subscribe to the channel.

369
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:15,098
That's about it.

370
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:18,801
We enjoyed a spring-like
winter camping trip at Mizugaki.

371
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:21,405
So, you guys went on
a camping trip like that

372
00:19:21,406 --> 00:19:23,489
when we went to Oigawa.

373
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,407
Although, a lot of it was made up.

374
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:29,833
Well, that's the end
of the camping stories.

375
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,010
Let's call it a day for today's chopping.

376
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:32,812
Yeah.

377
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:37,905
There's still a lot of firewood left.

378
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:39,302
Yeah.

379
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,011
While chopping wood,
I thought of something.

380
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,719
If we gather firewood
like this every year,

381
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,313
chop and dry it,
and then our juniors

382
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:54,609
can use them to make fires
when they go camping,

383
00:19:55,198 --> 00:19:58,112
it feels like
we're passing on a tradition,

384
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,094
like we're a real club.

385
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:01,700
Sure does.

386
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:05,402
It'd be great
if we get juniors to join our club.

387
00:20:05,403 --> 00:20:07,318
I'll make sure we get those juniors!

388
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:10,012
We'll become a real club this year!

389
00:20:12,304 --> 00:20:13,337
"WE CAN GO FLOWER VIEWING AT THIS CAMPSITE"
Rin-chan messaged me saying she found

390
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:16,297
"WE CAN GO FLOWER VIEWING AT THIS CAMPSITE"
a campsite where we can enjoy cherry blossoms.

391
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:20,885
I didn't know there was a campsite
in that place.

392
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,688
Yeah.

393
00:20:21,689 --> 00:20:24,183
Isn't this near Nadeshiko's place?

394
00:20:24,184 --> 00:20:25,889
Really?

395
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,808
It sounds great! Let's go with that!

396
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,561
All of us can finally
go camping together again since Izu.

397
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,799
Time to come up with the menu.

398
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:36,997
Alright, let's plan
our cherry blossom viewing camping trip!

399
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:10,690
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES CLUB

400
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,205
GRADUATION CEREMONY
SPRING BREAK BEGINS!

401
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:57,626
Rin-chan!

402
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:01,796
The eagerly awaited

403
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,923
and heart-pounding
spring break starts tomorrow!

404
00:23:04,924 --> 00:23:06,717
I wouldn't say heart-pounding…

405
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,392
Do you have any plans

406
00:23:08,393 --> 00:23:10,893
before our cherry blossom viewing trip?

407
00:23:10,894 --> 00:23:12,308
Hmm…

408
00:23:12,315 --> 00:23:14,523
I haven't decided yet.

409
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,418
Oh, cherry blossom pictures.

410
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,271
I took some too.

411
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,106
Look!

412
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,733
Let me see the ones you took, Rin-chan.

413
00:23:22,191 --> 00:23:24,402
They're probably all similar.

414
00:23:27,795 --> 00:23:36,181

BIKE TRIP AND CHERRY BLOSSOM VIEWING TRIP

415
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:36,792
WHEN ENJOYING CAMPING,

00:23:36,793 --> 00:23:37,401
OF THE CAMPGROUND AND ITS FACILITIES.

417
00:23:37,402 --> 00:23:38,504
DON'T FORGET TO PUT OUT YOUR CAMPFIRE
AND DISPOSE OF YOUR GARBAGE.

418
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:39,807
TEMPERATURES CAN CHANGE QUICKLY,
SO CHECK THE WEATHER FORECAST BEFOREHAND.

419
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:41,004
WEAR WARM CLOTHING IF NECESSARY
TO PREVENT COLD.
