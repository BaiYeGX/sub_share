1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

2
00:00:01,455 --> 00:00:06,559
RIN AND NADESHIKO'S INAGAKO SPRING CAMP

3
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:18,221
MINAMI-ALPS INAGAKO FOREST PARK

4
00:00:26,142 --> 00:00:28,445
Finally at Inagako Forest.

5
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:29,555
Let's see…

6
00:00:30,355 --> 00:00:33,356
The forest park is beyond the parking lot,

7
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,460
so the lake area is behind the rest area.

8
00:00:38,648 --> 00:00:42,127
SET MENU, FOREST SOUP CURRY, 1100 YEN

9
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:44,250
Forest Soup Curry.

10
00:00:44,754 --> 00:00:45,851
Gulp.

11
00:00:46,549 --> 00:00:49,247
In any case, let's check in first.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,153
The reception

13
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,134
should be over there.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,320
A HOLE IN A TREE IS A SHARED HOME
IN THE FOREST

15
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:06,939
This isn't the reception.

16
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,555
-So the reception's over there.
-Reception…

17
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:12,054
Excuse me.

18
00:01:12,054 --> 00:01:13,751
One night at the lake area

19
00:01:13,752 --> 00:01:16,158
and a bundle of firewood, please.

20
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:17,362
In that case,

21
00:01:17,363 --> 00:01:20,064
please fill in your name and address here.

22
00:01:24,555 --> 00:01:25,861
Rin!

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,147
I found a secret campsite

24
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:29,960
in the Minami-Alps!

25
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,054
A secret campsite?

26
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:35,153
I saw it on Guruguru Map.

27
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,960
It's one of the lakeside camps you like,

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,445
and there's an observatory deck
overlooking Kofu too!

29
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,640
Oh, this is Inagako.

30
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,064
Rin, you know the place?

31
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:51,961
I pass by that area often,

32
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:55,065
so I know there's a lake there.

33
00:01:55,742 --> 00:01:57,961
Didn't know
they had a campsite there, though.

34
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:02,450
We've got a few days of spring break left,

35
00:02:02,451 --> 00:02:04,954
want to go on one last camping trip
before school starts?

36
00:02:04,955 --> 00:02:06,867
Sure, let's do it.

37
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:12,254
Reached Kajikazawa!

38
00:02:12,853 --> 00:02:15,159
Cycling to the campsite now!

39
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:18,644
It's about 10 kilometres
from Kajikazawa to here.

40
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,653
With Nadeshiko's stamina,

41
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:22,466
she'll probably be here before noon.

42
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:40,460
The clouds are blocking the view

43
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:41,961
of Mt. Fuji.

44
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:48,352
All right, one last push to Inagako!

45
00:02:50,654 --> 00:02:52,654
Everything's all set up.

46
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:56,142
The field area here is completely separate

47
00:02:56,143 --> 00:02:59,159
from the camping zone.

48
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:02,455
The fees are higher,

49
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:05,362
but it isn't crowded like
in the free camping sites.

50
00:03:05,854 --> 00:03:07,857
The comfort and space
are much appreciated.

51
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:22,143
That's a big carp.

52
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,236
Could this be

53
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,857
another a well-kept secret spot?

54
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:06,160
Found a hot spring deep in the mountains!

55
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:08,554
A hot spring, huh?

56
00:04:10,748 --> 00:04:13,352
Was there a hot spring on the way here?

57
00:04:31,644 --> 00:04:34,866
It should've been a straight path
to the campsite!

58
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:38,357
I don't remember it being this far!

59
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:46,956
GOOD JOB!

60
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:49,851
Takao's Diamond Fuji.

61
00:04:49,852 --> 00:04:53,253
Is this the place Aki and the girls
visited during New Year's?

62
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,950
Wait, does that mean I…

63
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:02,550
So

64
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,757
"CAMPSITE, TO KAJIKAZAWA, HIRABAYASHI"
you missed the turn at the Hirabayashi,

65
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:08,039
"TAKAO DIAMOND FUJI"
ended up riding all the way to Takao,

66
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,352
and then had to cross the mountains
a second time to get back here?

67
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:12,846
Ah,

68
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:16,148
I guess I should check the map more often.

69
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:19,252
This campsite is on a mountain.

70
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,576
You should have noticed something
was off when you started going downhill.

71
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:33,065
It should be ready.

72
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:35,544
Baked apple.

73
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,846
I'm delicious!

74
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:45,841
All sliced up.

75
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:51,451
Now just to sprinkle on some cinnamon.

76
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:56,371
Nadeshiko, I got the ice cream.

77
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,966
Thanks, Rin.

78
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:00,955
Managed to buy them
before the rest area closed.

79
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:02,248
Thank goodness.

80
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,758
Finally, top it off with the ice cream…

81
00:06:07,046 --> 00:06:09,544
And the sweet apple tortilla…

82
00:06:09,544 --> 00:06:10,554
is done!

83
00:06:10,951 --> 00:06:13,153
That is way too much ice cream.

84
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:15,659
Time to dig in!

85
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:20,164
See, it's hard to bite into now, isn't it?

86
00:06:25,358 --> 00:06:26,565
Tastes so good.

87
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:28,044
It really does.

88
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:32,257
The chicken tortilla
we had earlier was great,

89
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,352
but this dessert version is just as nice.

90
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:35,455
Right?

91
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,862
I've always thought tortillas
are the perfect camping food

92
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:40,752
since you just wrap them up and eat them.

93
00:06:40,753 --> 00:06:42,456
And it cuts down on the washing up.

94
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:45,362
It could be fun
to prepare different fillings

95
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:46,757
and have everyone wrap their own

96
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,852
during a group camp.

97
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,648
That sounds like a great idea.

98
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,159
Spread cream cheese,

99
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,451
add kiwi slices,

100
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,367
drizzle mango sauce,
and top it off with fresh cream! Yum!

101
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,356
There really isn't one, is there?

102
00:07:15,745 --> 00:07:16,856
What's up?

103
00:07:16,857 --> 00:07:18,258
I was looking for campsites

104
00:07:18,258 --> 00:07:20,649
near Takao.

105
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,153
If there was one,

106
00:07:22,154 --> 00:07:26,456
we could see Diamond Fuji
during a New Year camp.

107
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:31,640
There are new campsites
popping up everywhere.

108
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:33,852
It'd be great if one could be built there.

109
00:07:34,252 --> 00:07:35,362
Yeah.

110
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:36,848
The scenery is beautiful there.

111
00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:38,151
If they had a campsite,
it would definitely be popular.

112
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:41,853
But I imagine the battle for bookings

113
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:43,659
would be intense
around New Year's and the holidays.

114
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:46,171
That's very possible.

115
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:48,631
If a campsite were built there,

116
00:07:48,632 --> 00:07:50,753
I'd love for the camping area
to be on a grassy field.

117
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:53,465
A quiet spot
where I could enjoy solo camping

118
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,955
would make me really happy.

119
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:57,258
Sounds amazing.

120
00:07:57,956 --> 00:08:00,654
Also, I wouldn't mind
if there wasn't a shop,

121
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:02,862
but I'd hope they at least sold firewood.

122
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:06,231
And it'd be great if they allowed pets

123
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:08,242
so people could bring their dogs
along for camping.

124
00:08:09,257 --> 00:08:11,347
Then Chikuwa could join us too.

125
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:13,446
Rin,

126
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:16,757
let's go see Diamond Fuji next year!

127
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:18,357
Sure,

128
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:20,258
if I don't forget.
