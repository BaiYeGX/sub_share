1
00:00:04,802 --> 00:00:07,463
You sure brought back
a lot of firewood, Aki!

2
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:11,401
Yesterday, the teacher and I went
to the firewood distribution point in Minobu.

3
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:16,704
But then the saw suddenly broke.

4
00:00:17,896 --> 00:00:21,848
Though, the headmaster came over
after that with a chainsaw and saved us.

5
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:24,302
He really helped us out.

6
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:28,797
Now the Outdoor Activities Club will be
chopping wood for the foreseeable future.

7
00:00:30,412 --> 00:00:31,095
But even if

8
00:00:31,096 --> 00:00:32,307
we chop them up nicely,

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,802
we can't use these firewoods right away.

10
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:38,614
They need to dry
for at least half a year to a year.

11
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:40,099
That long?

12
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:47,003
By the time the firewood dries,
it will be next year already.

13
00:00:47,004 --> 00:00:49,995
That means we'll still need
to buy firewood in the meantime.

14
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,692
No use getting hung up over it.

15
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:54,818
Let's start chopping some wood!

16
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:07,505
Nadeshiko, you're good.

17
00:01:08,598 --> 00:01:11,312
I happened to chop wood
when I went camping a while back.

18
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:13,088
Oh yeah, Nadeshiko.

19
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:14,203
Actually…

20
00:01:15,495 --> 00:01:17,890
when you guys went to Oigawa,

21
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:20,390
we had a camping trip of our own too.

22
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:21,198
That's right.

23
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:25,006
Where did you guys go camping?

24
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:26,895
Well…

25
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:29,687
Okay. Let's chop wood and talk about

26
00:01:29,688 --> 00:01:32,709
what happened during camping.

27
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:49,008
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

28
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:05,998
EPISODE 7: TRUTH OR LIES,
REALITY OR FICTION, MEMORIES OF CAMPING

29
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:09,197
This is Chiaki Ohgaki,
the one you know and love.

30
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:10,899
Nadeshiko and Rin went camping

31
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,103
with their friend
from Hamamatsu at Oigawa.

32
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:19,202
Meanwhile, us, the left-behind members
of the Outdoor Activities Club,

33
00:03:19,203 --> 00:03:21,522
found ourselves with plenty of free time,

34
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:23,993
so we ended up chatting
on social media until midnight.

35
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:25,912
I'm not sure if it was the late-night
mood getting to us, but before we knew it,

36
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:29,458
someone suggested,
"Hey, why don't we go camping too?"

37
00:03:30,097 --> 00:03:31,707
And just like that, it was decided.

38
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:35,604
And so, we packed up
and headed for the north of Yamanashi.

39
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:37,092
This time, we're going to share

40
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:41,239
the camping memoirs of the three of us
who decided to take the plunge.

41
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,825
BUS CAMP

42
00:03:43,827 --> 00:03:46,421
MEMOIRS OF THE CAMP OF THE LEFT-BEHIND
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES CLUB MEMBERS

43
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:50,196
Look, the world is already
starting to collapse!

44
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:52,498
This is a memory,
so I'm not cold at all. Woof!

45
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,493
Even Chikuwa is talking now…

46
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:56,395
After you.

47
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:57,254
I'm not going in!

48
00:03:57,255 --> 00:04:00,702
I regret to inform some bad news.

49
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:03,494
How did it turn out like this?

50
00:04:04,305 --> 00:04:06,697
I didn't expect we'd end up in Kobe!

51
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,998
SATURDAY, 21 MARCH 20XX
9:03 AM

52
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,744
IN FRONT OF NIRASAKI STATION
NIRASAKI CITY, YAMANASHI PREFECTURE

53
00:04:11,745 --> 00:04:14,405
Nirasaki Station!

54
00:04:15,107 --> 00:04:16,212
By the way,

55
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:19,202
I still don't know
where we're going today.

56
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:21,498
Usually Aki's in charge of planning

57
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:23,801
and we're kept in the dark.

58
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:25,290
It's nice to have a change
of pace once in a while.

59
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,301
Yep, yep…

60
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:29,601
Anyway, just look forward to it.

61
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:34,394
Though, it's been ages
since I last came to Nirasaki.

62
00:04:34,395 --> 00:04:36,905
I mean, there's usually no reason
for me to come here.

63
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:39,363
Aki-chan, what's that?

64
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:42,295
That's the Heiwa Kannon in Nirasaki…

65
00:04:42,296 --> 00:04:45,202
Hey, don't just barge
into someone's recap!

66
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,394
It's not a big deal.

67
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:48,603
No can do!

68
00:04:48,604 --> 00:04:50,998
The balance of the world
will be thrown off

69
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:53,311
if memories
of the non-existent get mixed in!

70
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:04,270
Look, the world is already
starting to collapse!

71
00:05:05,814 --> 00:05:08,775
Hurry up and go back
into your little window!

72
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:12,911
Aki's being so stingy.

73
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:14,896
And you too, Ena.

74
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,608
You didn't actually
bring Chikuwa that day!

75
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:18,651
Hang on, Aki!

76
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:23,790
Ena actually wanted
to bring Chikuwa along.

77
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,816
But

78
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:28,186
Yamanashi in March
is too cold for a Chihuahua.

79
00:05:28,187 --> 00:05:29,806
I'm sorry, Aki.

80
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,696
At least let me take Chikuwa

81
00:05:31,697 --> 00:05:34,207
camping with me in my memories.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,103
Ena…

83
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,088
Well, if it's just a dog,
I guess it's okay.

84
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:43,800
Don't forget to bring
Chikuwa's camping gear, okay?

85
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,010
Aki-chan!

86
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,207
That's great, Chikuwa, Hanpen!

87
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,806
Wait, why is there another dog
I've never seen before?

88
00:05:51,807 --> 00:05:55,801
"HANPEN'S GOOD DAYS"
Hanpen is my favourite

89
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:57,498
WeTube Samoyed.

90
00:05:57,499 --> 00:05:59,410
It has nothing to do with us!

91
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:02,103
"PLEASE BOARD THE FIRST BUS"
You two, the bus is here.

92
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,910
And so,

93
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:07,816
we boarded the bus at Nirasaki Station

94
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:11,494
and set off for the camping grounds
in the north of Yamanashi.

95
00:06:11,495 --> 00:06:13,338
Finally, we're off.

96
00:06:13,747 --> 00:06:16,290
After a while on this bus,
we'll arrive at a place called Akeno.

97
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:18,794
We'll buy some things
and have breakfast there.

98
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:20,712
Come to think of it,

99
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,504
"WHEN RIDING THE BUS IN REAL LIFE"
the three of us took a bus

100
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:23,838
"PLEASE MAKE SURE TO PUT YOUR PET IN A CARRIER"
when we went to Lake Yamanaka.

101
00:06:24,213 --> 00:06:25,718
This is a Bus Camp.

102
00:06:27,094 --> 00:06:30,306
Don't you think there are
a lot of cliffs around here?

103
00:06:30,905 --> 00:06:33,577
I heard they were formed
by the eruption of Yatsugatake.

104
00:06:33,578 --> 00:06:36,795
Nirasaki's Shichiri Rock Plateau
is also pretty famous.

105
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,605
By the way, why has the background

106
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,597
been blurry since a while ago?

107
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:45,988
Because we were too focused on chatting
and didn't pay much attention to the details.

108
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:47,796
Anyway,

109
00:06:47,797 --> 00:06:50,801
after about 20 minutes on the bus,

110
00:06:51,404 --> 00:06:53,900
we arrived at Akeno.

111
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:57,993
Feels chillier here than in Nirasaki.

112
00:06:57,994 --> 00:06:59,999
Are you cold, Chikuwa?

113
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:05,212
Hanpen's a Siberian dog, so you're not
bothered by the cold, aren't you?

114
00:07:05,213 --> 00:07:07,802
You brought Hanpen along in the end, huh?

115
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:15,399
You can clearly see the Southern Alps
and Yatsugatake from here.

116
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,097
It's so beautiful.

117
00:07:17,098 --> 00:07:18,900
The weather is so nice.

118
00:07:19,697 --> 00:07:21,728
"HOKUTO AGRICULTURAL MARKET"
So, what are we buying here?

119
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:22,801
Let me think.

120
00:07:22,802 --> 00:07:25,004
Carrots, onions…

121
00:07:25,005 --> 00:07:27,691
And Hokuto's speciality, tomatoes.

122
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,488
Right, tomatoes.

123
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:30,293
"IMPERFECT TOMATOES"
Hello!

124
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:31,097
"FILL AS YOU LIKE, ONE BAG FOR 500 YEN"
Hello!

125
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:34,697
What we want are these imperfect tomatoes
that you can fill as many as you can fit.

126
00:07:35,407 --> 00:07:39,603
That's why I've prepared
a tomato-themed menu for this trip.

127
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:41,453
Sounds good.

128
00:07:42,202 --> 00:07:43,467
A few minutes later.

129
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:45,488
All done shopping!

130
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:47,498
We didn't all need to buy the tomatoes.

131
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:49,687
One bag would've been enough.

132
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:50,411
Nah.

133
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:53,269
The fun part is stuffing them, isn't it?

134
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,203
"TOMATO CURRY"
Now that we've bought the vegetables,

135
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:58,493
let's go to the cafeteria on the first floor
for a late breakfast.

136
00:07:58,494 --> 00:07:59,270
Sure thing.

137
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:00,536
Breakfast!

138
00:08:01,005 --> 00:08:02,399
What are you getting, Aki-chan?

139
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,603
I'll get the recommended dish.

140
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:06,717
Same here.

141
00:08:06,718 --> 00:08:07,812
Me too.

142
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:12,614
Curry filled with local vegetables.

143
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:15,004
Thank you for the food!

144
00:08:19,109 --> 00:08:21,801
Pumpkin, sweet potato, zucchini,

145
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,097
these veggies taste so good!

146
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:27,150
Especially the tomatoes,
they go so well with the curry.

147
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:35,436
A curry worthy of the caption,
"made with locally sourced ingredients."

148
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:37,493
The vegetables are shining brilliantly.

149
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:39,308
Brilliantly, I say!

150
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,311
What's with the annoying subtitles?

151
00:08:42,301 --> 00:08:45,306
By the way, Toba-sensei said
she'll only come in the evening.

152
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:46,807
Is something up?

153
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,780
Toba-sensei said she has to finish
preparing lessons

154
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:51,708
-and grading papers before she can come.
-There's no end to this…

155
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:56,406
Even though today's a holiday.
Teachers have it tough.

156
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,203
Oi, Nadeshiko!

157
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,717
Your stomach's been growling
as if it's feral! It's loud!

158
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:03,910
Well, you guys have been
talking about curry non-stop…

159
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:08,296
Didn't you also
eat a lot of curry at Oigawa?

160
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,394
That was last week.

161
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:13,108
"THE TIME IS NOW 4 PM"
Talking about curry at this time

162
00:09:13,109 --> 00:09:15,087
is bound to make your stomach growl.

163
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,092
It's a crime to show off delicious food!

164
00:09:17,093 --> 00:09:19,398
When I go home today,
I'm definitely getting

165
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,702
fried chicken and sandwiches
from the convenience store!

166
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:22,703
Yes, yes…

167
00:09:23,103 --> 00:09:24,707
So, what's after this?

168
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,452
-We'll take another bus
-But it's so hard

169
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,196
-and continue heading north.
-to give up hot dogs.

170
00:09:28,197 --> 00:09:29,903
-After going further north,
-They've been

171
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:31,608
-we'll come across a lake.
-having…

172
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,436
-There…
-promotions for 100-yen rice balls…

173
00:09:33,437 --> 00:09:35,092
Nadeshiko-chan.

174
00:09:35,093 --> 00:09:36,967
We're losing track of what we're eating.

175
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:38,619
Could you keep it down please?

176
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:45,295
After about a 30-minute ride from Akeno,

177
00:09:45,296 --> 00:09:47,108
"MIZUGAKIKO"
the girls arrive at Mizugakiko.

178
00:09:47,109 --> 00:09:48,708
We're at Mizugakiko!

179
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,910
The temperature here

180
00:09:50,911 --> 00:09:53,405
is as cold as winter.

181
00:09:53,406 --> 00:09:55,410
We checked the weather
and brought cold weather gear

182
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:58,307
in advance,
so there's nothing to worry about.

183
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:02,004
Chikuwa, are you cold? Is everything okay?

184
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:03,998
This is a memory,
so I'm not cold at all. Woof!

185
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:06,592
Even Chikuwa is talking now…

186
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:09,395
Come to think of it, I think
I've heard that voice somewhere before.

187
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,290
Anyway, Aoi-chan,

188
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:13,713
what are we doing in Mizugakiko?

189
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,899
Actually, there's a shop ahead
that sells really delicious food.

190
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,191
Huh, out here in the deep mountains?

191
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,509
That's right.

192
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,196
Just go around to the other side
of the lake and you'll see.

193
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:26,791
We can take a walk and eat there.

194
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,520
Let's go check it out then.

195
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,457
What could it be?

196
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:57,239
Artificial lakes and natural lakes
have their own unique charm.

197
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:58,696
Girls, apparently there's

198
00:10:58,697 --> 00:11:01,879
a place up ahead called "Yosha no Yu."

199
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,192
What's that? A hot spring?

200
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:05,812
Weird name for one.

201
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:11,713
Since we're passing by anyway,
let's take a look.

202
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:13,494
All right.

203
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,302
Yosha no Yu.

204
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:20,509
Said to be a sodium-rich brine spring.

205
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,192
Apparently, they used to boil
the water and use it as a bath.

206
00:11:27,807 --> 00:11:29,098
After you.

207
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:30,696
I'm not going in!

208
00:11:30,697 --> 00:11:31,653
"YAMANASHI PREFECTURE, DAIMON SHIOYAMA DAM"
Isn't it written here

209
00:11:31,654 --> 00:11:32,608
"MANAGEMENT OFFICE, BATHING PROHIBITED"
that bathing is prohibited?

210
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:36,193
Even if it's a memory,
we can't just jump in there.

211
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:48,498
I felt like we walked
quite a long way after getting off the bus…

212
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,197
But I didn't expect

213
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:53,620
we'd end up in Kobe!

214
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,906
No, this isn't Kobe.

215
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:57,901
There's the pronunciation written below.

216
00:11:57,902 --> 00:11:59,600
Godo?

217
00:12:01,193 --> 00:12:03,099
Godoo…

218
00:12:04,094 --> 00:12:04,901
And then

219
00:12:04,902 --> 00:12:06,088
the explorers found themselves

220
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:08,010
in "Godoo" in their quest

221
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:11,651
for the secret shop
that served delicious food.

222
00:12:11,652 --> 00:12:14,110
"X GODOO, O GODO"
It's not "Godoo". It's "Godo".

223
00:12:15,008 --> 00:12:17,902
Oh, I didn't realise we'd already
chopped up so much wood.

224
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,902
We're getting the hang of it.

225
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,203
Well,

226
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:25,593
school's over,

227
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:27,495
so let's call it a day.

228
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:31,417
I want to know what you guys ate!

229
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:35,096
Save that for tomorrow's
firewood chopping session.

230
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:36,391
That's right.

231
00:12:38,995 --> 00:12:40,132
YAMANASHI PREFECTURE CHERRY BLOSSOM
BLOOMING INFORMATION

232
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,499
Looks like blooming season
starts March 27th this year.

233
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,734
Well, it's usually around
this time every year.

234
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:50,739
Wow, you guys got a lot of wood!

235
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,999
About two cars worth.

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,296
So, we started chopping them up yesterday.

237
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:57,703
Chopping wood will be the primary activity

238
00:12:57,704 --> 00:12:59,109
for the Outdoor Activities Club
for the time being.

239
00:13:00,195 --> 00:13:02,598
Sorry, I have work later.

240
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:03,797
I need to get home early.

241
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:07,697
You should help us out, Rin!

242
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:08,797
Next time.

243
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,407
By the way,

244
00:13:10,408 --> 00:13:13,802
after the spring break starts,
we're planning a flower-viewing camping trip.

245
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:15,037
You should join us, Rin-chan.

246
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:17,203
A flower-viewing camp, huh?

247
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:19,048
All right. I'll consider it.

248
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:21,120
See you later!

249
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:30,100
Spring break,
cherry blossom viewing, biking, camping.

250
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:35,115
All right! Let's get down
for another day of chopping wood!

251
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:40,812
"POTATO CRISPS, CHEESE POTATO STICKS"
I stocked up on snacks

252
00:13:40,813 --> 00:13:42,900
so I can be ready
for the onslaught of delicious food!

253
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:45,406
We can share.

254
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,744
Oh… thanks.

255
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:51,900
Come on! I want to hear
about the rest of your camping trip!

256
00:13:51,901 --> 00:13:53,498
Right.

257
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,182
The three of us planned to visit
a "mysterious shop that sells delicious food"

258
00:13:57,183 --> 00:13:59,911
on our way to the campsite,

259
00:13:59,912 --> 00:14:01,203
so we passed by Mizugakiko

260
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:03,496
and entered Godo.

261
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:05,797
That's the place.

262
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:06,610
YAKITORI (GRILLED CHICKEN SKEWERS)

263
00:14:06,611 --> 00:14:09,016
So, the mystery food was yakitori.

264
00:14:09,017 --> 00:14:11,197
"SALT-FLAVOURED YAKITORI"
Sorry to keep you waiting.

265
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:12,102
"GREEN ONION, CARTILAGE"
I'm going to dig in.

266
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:13,005
"CHICKEN MEATBALLS, GIZZARD"
I'm going to dig in.

267
00:14:15,912 --> 00:14:16,912
Yum!

268
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:27,308
The subtle saltiness really brings out
the sweetness of the meat.

269
00:14:28,094 --> 00:14:29,408
How should I put it?

270
00:14:29,409 --> 00:14:32,823
This kind of saltiness really makes you
feel like you're "eating meat."

271
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,040
I'm sure Toba-sensei would like this

272
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,906
if we brought this to the campsite.

273
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:39,802
That's a good idea.

274
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:41,302
Excuse me.

275
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:44,100
Ten more skewers to go, please.

276
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:44,803
Coming right up!

277
00:14:47,203 --> 00:14:48,527
What's the matter, Inuko?

278
00:14:49,698 --> 00:14:52,812
I regret to inform some bad news.

279
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:53,797
TIME NOW 1:00 PM, YAKITORI MIZUGAKI

280
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:55,584
Just when we were indulging
in the delectable yakitori,

281
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:58,089
a bus is about to leave.

282
00:14:58,808 --> 00:15:00,506
And that's bad?

283
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,194
"MIZUGAKIKO (LAKE MIZUGAKI)"
It takes about 30 minutes to get

284
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,986
"MIZUGAKIKO (LAKE MIZUGAKI)"
from Mizugakiko to the bus stop.

285
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:09,005
Since we can't catch the 1:25 PM bus,

286
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:11,401
we'll have to take the 2:13 PM one.

287
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:14,412
"MASUTOMI HOT SPRINGS"
Then, to go to the hot springs,

288
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,999
we have to get off at Masutomi first.

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,588
The next bus is at 3:41 PM.

290
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:21,297
Then we have to take the bus from there

291
00:15:21,298 --> 00:15:24,303
to the last stop and walk to the campsite.

292
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,281
But by the time we get to the campsite,
the office will already be closed.

293
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:30,803
So, this plan is a no-go.

294
00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:33,906
What should we do next then?

295
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:34,808
I did some quick calculations.

296
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:38,310
If we take another route to Masutomi,

297
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:41,374
we might just make it in time for the bus.

298
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,411
But it'll take an hour.

299
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:45,870
Walking… for an hour sounds tiring…

300
00:15:45,871 --> 00:15:47,593
Anyway, in short,

301
00:15:47,594 --> 00:15:49,655
as long as we don't go to the hot springs
and head directly to the campsite,

302
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:52,125
it'll be fine.

303
00:15:52,126 --> 00:15:54,812
Don't be ridiculous, Aoi!

304
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:56,093
Ena's right.

305
00:15:56,094 --> 00:15:57,948
"HOT SPRINGS"
How can we just abandon

306
00:15:57,949 --> 00:15:59,802
"HOT SPRINGS"
the essence of camping like that?

307
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:01,210
I figured.

308
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,197
And so,

309
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,906
we decided to take an alternative route
from Godo to Masutomi Hot Springs.

310
00:16:07,907 --> 00:16:09,093
But later,

311
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:13,401
we deeply regretted choosing
a path of utter torment.

312
00:16:13,402 --> 00:16:15,907
Utter… utter torment!?

313
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:23,193
How did it turn out like this?

314
00:16:23,711 --> 00:16:26,401
It's been a steep slope since earlier.

315
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:26,956
YAKITORI MIZUGAKI, CURRENT LOCATION:
MASUTOMI HOT SPRINGS

316
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:27,510
On the map,

317
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,395
it looked like it was just a winding road,

318
00:16:29,396 --> 00:16:30,906
but when we switched to 3D imaging,

319
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,401
we're basically climbing a mountain!

320
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:35,704
With a height difference of 170 metres.

321
00:16:36,407 --> 00:16:38,193
That happens a lot with maps…

322
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:42,098
It's manageable without anything in hand,

323
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:43,911
but carrying luggage while climbing

324
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,515
is next-level exhausting.

325
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:47,105
You got that right.

326
00:16:48,803 --> 00:16:52,203
But what's this feeling?

327
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:54,802
Supposedly, I have no heavy backpack.

328
00:16:54,803 --> 00:16:56,489
-Yet, when I climb,
-So miserable…

329
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,696
-I can't help but feel the burden
-Dying…

330
00:16:57,697 --> 00:16:58,901
-on my shoulders increasing…
-Dying…

331
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:03,203
-Is this the effect of fatigue?
-Aki…

332
00:17:03,204 --> 00:17:05,464
Gah! So it was you two!

333
00:17:06,495 --> 00:17:09,010
I'm so tired… Let's take a break…

334
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:12,011
No, we can't. Time is of the essence.

335
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,703
Finally, we reached the mountaintop.

336
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:26,692
So tired…

337
00:17:26,693 --> 00:17:27,693
The yakitori

338
00:17:27,694 --> 00:17:32,391
was so close to making
a reappearance as curry…

339
00:17:34,203 --> 00:17:36,197
From here, it's all downhill.

340
00:17:36,198 --> 00:17:39,307
We should make it in time
for a dip in the hot spring.

341
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,100
You two, hop on!

342
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,687
We'll ride this cart
and slide down all the way!

343
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:45,214
That would lead us straight off the cliff.

344
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,199
Anyway, let's hurry down.

345
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,088
The hot springs!

346
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:56,198
Only ten minutes until the bus arrives.

347
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,421
Hot spring…!

348
00:17:57,422 --> 00:17:59,693
Thanks to that uphill stretch earlier,
I'm sweating all over now!

349
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:04,296
That was so refreshing!

350
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:05,708
That was fast!

351
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:09,812
Actually, there was only enough time
to break a sweat.

352
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:11,922
After all, the bus is coming soon.

353
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:14,000
Shame for the all effort…

354
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,053
The exhaustion from climbing,
the soothing attack of the hot spring,

355
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,999
and the warmth of the wood stove fire.

356
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:21,892
Wait a minute!

357
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,192
Hey, you two!

358
00:18:23,193 --> 00:18:25,927
The last bus is coming in three minutes!

359
00:18:26,307 --> 00:18:28,692
Just let me rest for a minute.

360
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:30,203
You say that,

361
00:18:30,204 --> 00:18:33,021
but once you lie down and close your eyes,
you'll definitely fall asleep!

362
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,197
Fret not, Inuko.

363
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:40,993
All you gotta do is
keep an eye open like this

364
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,807
and you for sure won't fall asleep

365
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:46,699
while resting…

366
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:50,198
You just fell asleep!

367
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,797
Hurry up, or we'll really miss the bus!

368
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:55,094
Hanpen, what are you doing?

369
00:18:55,505 --> 00:18:58,308
What a fluffy blanket you make…

370
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:06,542
LAID-BACK CAMP
MASUTOMI AREA, END

371
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:09,203
So, did you guys end up oversleeping?

372
00:19:09,204 --> 00:19:12,199
No, we managed
to barely catch the bus in the end.

373
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:27,761
PIZZA

374
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:32,105
After that, we took a bus from Masutomi
for about 20 minutes,

375
00:19:32,107 --> 00:19:33,505
winding along the mountain roads.

376
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,412
Then,
the bus finally reached the terminal.

377
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:40,694
So cold! Freezing cold!

378
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:43,708
There's still a bit of frost here.

379
00:19:43,709 --> 00:19:46,312
It still feels like winter around here.

380
00:19:46,313 --> 00:19:46,907
CHICHIBU-TAMA-KAI NATIONAL PARK
HOKUTO MOUNTAIN VILLAGE

381
00:19:46,908 --> 00:19:49,906
This is one stylish mountain village.

382
00:19:49,907 --> 00:19:53,011
Do hikers stay here
when they come to climb the mountain?

383
00:19:55,906 --> 00:19:59,803
Eating ice cream by the fire is the best!

384
00:20:00,698 --> 00:20:02,291
Hey, if we keep resting,

385
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:04,610
we'll really miss
the campsite office hours.

386
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:07,989
"ROAD INFORMATION, CRYSTAL LANE"
2.6 kilometres to go.

387
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,813
"DARK FOREST, PROCEED SLOWLY"
It'll take about 30 minutes on foot.

388
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:13,109
Hopefully,
it won't be another difficult steep path?

389
00:20:13,899 --> 00:20:16,500
And then, at 3:23 PM…

390
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:22,911
We arrived at our final destination,
Mount Mizugaki Campground.

391
00:20:23,393 --> 00:20:24,985
At last!

392
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:28,702
So this is the campground.

393
00:20:28,703 --> 00:20:29,856
Not only is the camping area
wide and spacious,

394
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:31,009
but you also get
a crystal clear view of the mountains.

395
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:32,598
What a fantastic place!

396
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,607
Right.

397
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:34,297
Right?

398
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:37,499
Anyway, let's get our check-in sorted.

399
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,403
Okay.

400
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:43,909
The office is basically a grocery store.

401
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,400
They have quite a variety of vegetables.

402
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:47,198
Hi there!

403
00:20:47,199 --> 00:20:48,603
"SOBA, HOTO (A REGIONAL NOODLE SOUP)"
They've got noodles too.

404
00:20:48,604 --> 00:20:50,094
They have hoto and soba.

405
00:20:51,113 --> 00:20:52,708
SHOYU GARLIC

406
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,456
"Shoyu garlic"?
NOTE: THIS IS SUPPOSED

407
00:20:53,457 --> 00:20:54,203
"Shoyu garlic"?
NOTE: TO BE A JOKE ABOUT A TYPO

408
00:20:54,715 --> 00:20:56,405
What is it, Aki?

409
00:20:56,406 --> 00:20:58,593
What's this "shoyu"?

410
00:20:58,594 --> 00:20:59,884
"Shoyu"?

411
00:20:59,885 --> 00:21:02,197
Maybe they meant
to type "shouyu" (soy sauce)?

412
00:21:02,198 --> 00:21:05,707
But it says "shoyu"
in the ingredient list too.

413
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:06,811
Oh, you're right.

414
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:10,816
Maybe they were in a hurry
and made a typo?

415
00:21:10,817 --> 00:21:14,395
Not proofreading labels
sounds even more concerning.

416
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:16,005
Excuse me!

417
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:19,598
What is this "shoyu"?

418
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,317
Oh, this…

419
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,504
It's "shoyu".

420
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:26,369
What exactly is it, though?

421
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,994
I'm pretty sure that's just garlic
marinated in soy sauce.

422
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:31,098
But I didn't have the courage to try it.

423
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:34,306
So, we decided to lure Toba-sensei
into buying it instead.

424
00:21:34,307 --> 00:21:37,187
And thus, we come to the final chapter
of our camping misadventures!

425
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:12,092
Aki, another ice cream?

426
00:23:12,093 --> 00:23:14,811
I'm tired after all that walking…

427
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:16,602
You need sugar when you're low on energy.

428
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,411
That's right.

429
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:18,984
Oh, Ena too.

430
00:23:19,513 --> 00:23:20,985
You're holding one, too, Aoi.

431
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:36,296
NEXT EPISODE:
THE ONSLAUGHT OF MOUTH-WATERING FOOD!!

432
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:36,922
WHEN ENJOYING CAMPING,
BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RULES

433
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:37,547
OF THE CAMPGROUND AND ITS FACILITIES.

434
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:38,801
DON'T FORGET TO PUT OUT YOUR CAMPFIRE
AND DISPOSE OF YOUR GARBAGE.

435
00:23:38,802 --> 00:23:40,219
TEMPERATURES CAN CHANGE QUICKLY,
SO CHECK THE WEATHER FORECAST BEFOREHAND.

436
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,202
WEAR WARM CLOTHING IF NECESSARY
TO PREVENT COLD.
