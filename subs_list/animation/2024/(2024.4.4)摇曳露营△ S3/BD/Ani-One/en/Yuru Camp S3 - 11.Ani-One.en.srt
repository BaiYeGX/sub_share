00:00:04,974 --> 00:00:08,339
HEALTH CHECKER

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,296
Dad, anal fissure, return quickly.

3
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:13,708
Why is it telling me like it's a telegram?

4
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,798
And anal fissure?

5
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:18,001
So,

6
00:00:18,002 --> 00:00:21,395
you said you'd come tomorrow.
Why are you here now?

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,557
Well…

8
00:00:22,558 --> 00:00:25,105
It all started when my aunt in Takayama

9
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,825
gave me something.

10
00:00:28,897 --> 00:00:30,017
Something?

11
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:46,170
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

12
00:02:01,116 --> 00:02:02,605
ONE WEEK AGO

13
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:03,892
A bicycle?

14
00:02:03,894 --> 00:02:05,506
"THE SCENERY FROM MEMORY LANE"
Yes.

15
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:08,908
You mentioned
you recently started camping, didn't you?

16
00:02:10,413 --> 00:02:12,700
"AUNT FROM TAKAYAMA"
I happen to have a bicycle that I'm not using.

17
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:14,506
It's great for carrying gear

18
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:16,693
and perfect for camping.

19
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:18,704
I'll be coming down soon.

20
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,402
If you want it, I can bring it to you.

21
00:02:20,403 --> 00:02:22,908
A bicycle, huh?

22
00:02:24,403 --> 00:02:27,995
Can I use it to get to school, Aunty?

23
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:30,710
Of course you can! It goes super fast.

24
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:31,907
Super fast you say?

25
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,923
A bike made for camping?

26
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,303
Is it something like that?

27
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:40,596
I've gained quite a bit of weight
from all the camp food lately.

28
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:43,904
I was thinking of starting
to bike to school this spring.

29
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:47,845
Then I'll gladly accept it.

30
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:49,200
All right.

31
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,601
I'll bring it over on the 1st.
Wait for me.

32
00:02:51,602 --> 00:02:53,095
Sure, see you then.

33
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:54,106
Bye.

34
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:58,596
1ST APRIL AUNT FROM TAKAYAMA
2ND APRIL CHERRY BLOSSOM VIEWING CAMP

35
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:02,404
Time to pack
for the cherry blossom viewing camp.

36
00:03:03,228 --> 00:03:04,305
1ST APRIL

37
00:03:04,306 --> 00:03:07,805
Aoi-chan, our aunt from Takayama's here.

38
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:09,499
I'll be right there.

39
00:03:10,798 --> 00:03:12,399
Aoi-chan!

40
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,196
How do you like it? Looks cool, right?

41
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:22,107
It's a bit different
from what I imagined.

42
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:23,893
What's this, Akari-chan?

43
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:26,997
You're still the same height
as last time we met.

44
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,295
Wasn't the last time we met
during New Year's?

45
00:03:29,297 --> 00:03:32,133
How could I have grown taller
in such a short time?

46
00:03:32,134 --> 00:03:33,805
I'll start growing soon.

47
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:36,987
You're about the same height as me,
aren't you, Aoi-chan?

48
00:03:36,988 --> 00:03:38,206
Good, good…

49
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,404
If you were any taller or shorter,

50
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:41,098
the bike might not fit you as well.

51
00:03:42,905 --> 00:03:44,898
In this box are the various accessories.

52
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:48,602
Always make sure you wear a helmet
and turn on the front and rear lights.

53
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:51,315
I've written all the important details
on the note.

54
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:52,993
Make sure to read them before riding.

55
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:56,109
I've given it a basic maintenance check,

56
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,904
but if you have any questions,
you can ask Tatsuo.

57
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,003
My dad?

58
00:04:00,004 --> 00:04:00,900
Yep.

59
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:05,404
He used to be really into road cycling.

60
00:04:05,405 --> 00:04:08,206
His legs were as strong
as a professional cyclist's.

61
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:10,603
Never heard him talk about that.

62
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:12,009
Well,

63
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,909
I have things to do now.

64
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,509
See you next time.

65
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:17,507
She left.

66
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:20,602
Aunty is always in such a rush.

67
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:21,921
Uh-huh.

68
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:26,624
Aoi-chan, what will you do with the bike?

69
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,909
Since I'm free today,

70
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,305
I'll take it for a spin
to the convenience store.

71
00:04:34,306 --> 00:04:37,306
Can you buy me a bag of crisps?
I want the wasabi ones.

72
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:41,113
Helmet and lights are set.

73
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,316
Off we go.

74
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:49,504
Feels a bit wobbly.

75
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:55,098
Riding this bike makes me nervous
even though it's just a bicycle.

76
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,103
Is it because I'm in a different posture?

77
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:00,216
And compared to my usual bike,

78
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,915
this one is incredibly light.

79
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:04,398
Let's see…

80
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:09,316
To shift gears, I need to push the lever
on the inside of the brake, right?

81
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:13,706
It got heavier.

82
00:05:15,806 --> 00:05:18,102
Wow, this thing is super fast!

83
00:05:18,103 --> 00:05:19,608
Riding it feels so smooth!

84
00:05:21,205 --> 00:05:24,113
You mainly use
the right side for shifting.

85
00:05:24,114 --> 00:05:27,409
The left side is for steep hills.

86
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:32,205
This feels great!

87
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,497
I had my doubts

88
00:05:34,498 --> 00:05:36,211
when I heard it was a fast bike,

89
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:38,607
since they ultimately rely
on human strength.

90
00:05:38,608 --> 00:05:40,697
I stand corrected.

91
00:05:41,691 --> 00:05:44,498
I see, I see. It really is fast.

92
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,785
The brakes are super sensitive!

93
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:52,601
If I squeeze too hard,
it could be dangerous.

94
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:56,003
Because the brakes are very responsive,
be careful while riding.

95
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:57,310
If you brake too hard suddenly,

96
00:05:57,311 --> 00:06:00,113
you might flip over, so you need
to control the pressure carefully.

97
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:03,695
Normally, you hold the top
of the handlebars while riding.

98
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,518
But for downhill,

99
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,492
it's better to grip the lower part
to make braking easier.

100
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,805
Gripping the lower part
does give you better control.

101
00:06:18,405 --> 00:06:19,004
I wonder how fast this bike can go

102
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,806
if I pedal with all my strength?

103
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:28,337
All right.

104
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:46,794
4-41 kilometres per hour?

105
00:06:46,795 --> 00:06:48,873
That's faster than a moped!

106
00:06:51,306 --> 00:06:52,108
But

107
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:54,503
this is way too scary!

108
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:01,206
I should stick to a slower pace.

109
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:03,124
Going too fast isn't good for my heart.

110
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,608
Do bicycles have speed limits?

111
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:18,009
Before I knew it,
I'm already at the convenience store.

112
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:25,004
Maybe I should take this a bit further.

113
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,217
MINOBU SPECIALITY MANJU

114
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:43,002
Manju tastes even better
when you're tired.

115
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:46,201
I can't believe I cycled all the way
to Minobu Station without realising it.

116
00:07:46,904 --> 00:07:48,216
Speaking of which,

117
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:51,201
Aki went ahead to solo camp
at the campsite.

118
00:07:51,897 --> 00:07:54,311
Is it near Nadeshiko's house?

119
00:08:06,607 --> 00:08:08,613
I'll ride all the way to where Aki is!

120
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:12,305
…And that's how I ended up here.

121
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:14,794
It's almost 30 kilometres from your house.

122
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:16,456
I'm impressed you managed
to bike all the way here.

123
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:20,602
That's because it's lighter
than a regular bike,

124
00:08:20,603 --> 00:08:22,706
making it easier to ride.

125
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:23,960
Even though I got tired,

126
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,473
it was still a manageable distance.

127
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:29,004
But my butt

128
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:32,113
is a little sore.

129
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,398
So this is the bike.

130
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,977
It looks pretty cool.

131
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:41,398
The handlebars sort of look
like Caribou-kun's antlers.

132
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,497
Now that you mention it,
they do resemble them a bit.

133
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:44,712
Right?

134
00:08:45,498 --> 00:08:48,103
Well, I should get going.

135
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:50,096
It'll take some time to ride back home.

136
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:52,794
Don't want to be out there when it's dark.

137
00:08:52,795 --> 00:08:53,696
You're right.

138
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:55,206
Be careful on your way back.

139
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,495
Oh no, a flat tire!

140
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:02,097
What… what should I do now?

141
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:05,300
TAKABAYASHI MEATS

142
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:09,410
Lamb can be a bit gamey,
and some people don't like it.

143
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:13,493
Better buy two portions of pork
and one portion of lamb.

144
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:16,304
Assuming 200 grams per person,

145
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,992
"CHERRY BLOSSOM VIEWING CAMP MEMBERS"
for six people, that's 1200 grams.

146
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,809
So we need 400 grams of lamb
and 800 grams of pork.

147
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,712
No, wait…

148
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:24,107
This is delicious!

149
00:09:24,108 --> 00:09:28,102
Kagamihara-san alone
could probably eat around 400 grams.

150
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,317
In that case…

151
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,196
And Akari-chan will probably join us too.

152
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:35,706
The others will take care
of the vegetables.

153
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:37,493
All that's left is the sauce and…

154
00:09:38,914 --> 00:09:42,613
This… this meat is…

155
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,999
Got it. After six, right?

156
00:09:47,711 --> 00:09:49,671
Sorry about the trouble.

157
00:09:50,998 --> 00:09:54,810
My dad said he'd come pick me up
in the van after work.

158
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:57,695
Luckily, your family's got a spacious car.

159
00:09:57,696 --> 00:10:01,016
Well then, just sit down and relax
until he comes to get you.

160
00:10:02,684 --> 00:10:04,394
Thank you. I'll do just that.

161
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:09,790
So spicy! Super spicy!

162
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,300
But… it's really tasty.

163
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,108
Dilute it a little and it'll be perfect.

164
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:16,998
Hey,

165
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,107
why doesn't that bike have a kickstand?

166
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:21,294
I looked it up.

167
00:10:21,295 --> 00:10:25,164
Apparently, these types of bikes
don't have them to keep the weight down.

168
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:26,893
So if you don't park it properly

169
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:29,497
and the tires move a bit,
it could topple over.

170
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:32,102
Even if you're just stopping briefly,
you have to be careful.

171
00:10:35,597 --> 00:10:37,301
In that case,

172
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,011
how about using this strap

173
00:10:39,012 --> 00:10:41,806
to keep the brakes engaged?

174
00:10:43,004 --> 00:10:45,701
That way, the tires won't move.
That's a good idea.

175
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:48,206
But what's this strap?

176
00:10:48,207 --> 00:10:50,898
I made it earlier to pass the time.

177
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,400
It's called a paracord bracelet.

178
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:57,497
Making ginger ales and bracelets.

179
00:10:57,498 --> 00:10:59,238
You sure are enjoying the solo camp life.

180
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:01,388
You can have it if you need.

181
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:02,352
Can I?

182
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:06,800
I bought a 30-metre roll anyway.
There's still plenty left.

183
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,591
I can whip up another in no time.

184
00:11:08,592 --> 00:11:12,346
Sounds like you could make
a lot of bracelets.

185
00:11:12,347 --> 00:11:13,591
Well then,

186
00:11:13,592 --> 00:11:16,993
I shall gratefully use this.

187
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,300
This is such a quiet and nice campsite.

188
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,311
Right?

189
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:33,893
A handmade paracord bracelet

190
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:36,112
can sell for around 1,000 yen each.

191
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,607
Quite a lot of people
are selling them online.

192
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:39,815
Seriously?

193
00:11:39,816 --> 00:11:41,492
I suppose
I should charge you 1,000 yen then.

194
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:44,008
Nope. It's mine already.

195
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,410
Please reconsider.

196
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:59,441
The cherry blossoms here
are spectacular too!

197
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:01,810
They say they're 300 years old.

198
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:14,999
After 300 years, you'd figure
they could use some support.

199
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:17,306
They've been standing
for 300 years after all.

200
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:20,096
Jiunji Temple.

201
00:12:20,097 --> 00:12:22,195
"JIUNJI TEMPLE"
Doesn't "Jiunji Temple"

202
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:24,201
just make you want to say it out loud?

203
00:12:25,206 --> 00:12:26,388
Jiunji Temple.

204
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:27,898
Jiunji Temple.

205
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:28,810
Jiunji Temple.

206
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:30,097
Jiunji Temple.

207
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,501
Jiunji Temple.

208
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:45,217
What's with this photo?

209
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:49,800
So, you drove to all these places
to see the cherry blossoms.

210
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:52,697
Rin-chan, you took a lot of pictures too.

211
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,400
Oh, it's the fruit park!

212
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,893
Did you go solo camping yesterday?

213
00:12:57,894 --> 00:12:58,894
-Yes.
-That parfait looks delicious!

214
00:12:58,895 --> 00:13:01,003
I went to the mountains
in Fujikawacho this time.

215
00:13:01,004 --> 00:13:03,118
There were lots of cherry blossoms blooming.
It was pretty nice.

216
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,300
And there's a hot spring
on a cliff nearby.

217
00:13:08,301 --> 00:13:09,702
That was pretty interesting.

218
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:13,102
I'll have to check it out next time.

219
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:14,711
Can you give me the address?

220
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:17,404
Here's our house-made
baked custard pudding.

221
00:13:17,405 --> 00:13:18,822
Thank you.

222
00:13:27,196 --> 00:13:29,482
Homemade baked custard pudding.

223
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,889
This pudding looks firm.

224
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,149
Let's dig in.

225
00:13:39,802 --> 00:13:42,987
Vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel

226
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,407
paired with an egg-rich,
baked custard pudding.

227
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:49,009
It has such a simple, comforting taste.

228
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:53,096
This pudding has a wonderful texture!

229
00:13:53,097 --> 00:13:55,503
It's like eating firm grilled tofu.

230
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:58,197
It does feel like grilled tofu.

231
00:14:00,708 --> 00:14:02,497
All you took pictures of
at Katsunuma Station

232
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:04,904
were just the trains.

233
00:14:05,894 --> 00:14:08,195
Well, they had those retro trains,
so I got carried away…

234
00:14:08,196 --> 00:14:09,706
Speaking of which,

235
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,300
besides Katsunuma,

236
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:12,607
I think there are some parks
in Fujikawacho

237
00:14:12,608 --> 00:14:16,294
that also have retro trams.

238
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:17,201
Really?

239
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,800
It's probably this place,
Fujikawa Nagasawa Park.

240
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,305
Such cute, retro trams!

241
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:29,909
Apparently,
Kofu used to have trams running as well.

242
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,096
And,

243
00:14:31,097 --> 00:14:35,206
in Nirasaki, there's a park
that has steam locomotives.

244
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,619
Steam locomotives as well?

245
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,300
Fujii Park in Nirasaki

246
00:14:40,301 --> 00:14:43,195
not only has steam locomotives
and electric locomotives on display,

247
00:14:43,196 --> 00:14:45,893
but it also
has mini steam locomotives running.

248
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:47,300
What kind of park is that?

249
00:14:47,302 --> 00:14:49,300
Sakura, can we…

250
00:14:49,301 --> 00:14:50,331
It's late.

251
00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:51,697
Let's leave that for another day.

252
00:14:55,206 --> 00:14:57,301
Did you take this in Isawa?

253
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:00,805
I took this picture because the mountain
had a pattern that looked like

254
00:15:00,806 --> 00:15:02,299
a torii gate on it.

255
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,811
But what exactly is this?

256
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:06,404
It's called Oigatayaki.

257
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,907
Oigatayaki?

258
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:11,711
I was just about to go see it.

259
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:12,905
Want to come along?

260
00:15:14,902 --> 00:15:16,300
Sakura?

261
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,602
The view here is really nice.

262
00:15:37,299 --> 00:15:38,207
Rin-chan,

263
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:40,701
where can we see the Oigatayaki?

264
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:42,405
Let me think.

265
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:45,197
It should be near that mountain.

266
00:15:45,902 --> 00:15:49,294
Starting on April 1st,
they light up torii gate-shaped fires here

267
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:52,316
every evening for a few days.

268
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:56,796
But actually, it's not a torii gate,

269
00:15:56,798 --> 00:15:57,798
it's more like an "oi".

270
00:15:58,306 --> 00:15:59,405
"Oi"?

271
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:01,395
I'm not exactly sure about the details.

272
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:03,608
Oigatayaki,

273
00:16:04,404 --> 00:16:07,014
a bonfire shaped like the "oi"
that ascetics carry on their backs.

274
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:08,992
In the Heian period,

275
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:12,404
there was a severe conflict
between Daizenji in Koshu

276
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:14,498
and Chokokuji in Fuefuki.

277
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:16,098
"CHOKOKUJI, DAIZENJI"
Ready…

278
00:16:16,704 --> 00:16:17,597
Fight!

279
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,196
The conflict was so intense
that it resulted in deaths,

280
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:25,211
prompting Yamanashioka Shrine
to join Chokokuji's side

281
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:27,608
to try and calm things down.

282
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:31,497
However, this only angered
the monks of Daizenji,

283
00:16:31,498 --> 00:16:34,800
who retaliated by stealing and burning
the torii gate of Yamanashioka Shrine.

284
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:38,612
The monks of Chokokuji, in turn,

285
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:41,894
became furious
and burned Daizenji's oi as revenge.

286
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:46,295
That's the origin of Fuefuki's Oigatayaki

287
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:49,618
and Koshu's torii gate burning.

288
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,389
That's a dark story…

289
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,873
I thought it would be
a more festive story.

290
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,892
History is often like that.

291
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:03,313
Even the warlords of the Sengoku period
are seen as heroes today.

292
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:05,712
Apparently, since the Edo period,

293
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:09,206
people have been lighting these fires
to send off spirits.

294
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:10,702
I see…

295
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:14,310
Since people still light the Oigatayaki,

296
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:16,306
does that mean
the torii gate burning still happens?

297
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,703
The torii gate burning happens in October.

298
00:17:19,704 --> 00:17:20,831
In fact,

299
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,202
it's actually right behind you.

300
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,290
So, we're directly below
where the torii gate burning takes place.

301
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:31,207
It seems that the Oigatayaki
is now done with lights.

302
00:17:31,209 --> 00:17:34,910
But the torii gate burning is still
done with wood, just like in the past.

303
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:39,508
Koshu's torii gate burning
is an event held in early October.

304
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:41,398
Local middle school volunteers

305
00:17:41,399 --> 00:17:43,904
carry firewood up the slope
of Mount Kashioyama,

306
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:46,112
and on the day of the torii gate burning,

307
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:49,893
they run through the town
with torches lit from Daizenji,

308
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:52,096
eventually lighting the torii gate

309
00:17:52,097 --> 00:17:53,899
on the mountain.

310
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,822
Middle schoolers sure are energetic.

311
00:17:57,486 --> 00:17:59,618
It does sound intriguing.

312
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:02,705
I wonder if we could
do something like that while camping?

313
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:05,597
The moment you start running
around the campsite with a torch,

314
00:18:05,598 --> 00:18:06,998
you'll probably be kicked out.

315
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:12,493
By the way,
Rin-chan, do you come here often?

316
00:18:13,903 --> 00:18:15,498
I used to come a lot when I was a kid.

317
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,598
Every spring,
my family would go cherry blossom viewing,

318
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,794
have dinner in Kofu,

319
00:18:21,795 --> 00:18:24,617
and then come here to see the Oigatayaki.

320
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:25,894
I see.

321
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,799
Even though it's been a long time

322
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,109
and I didn't ride here myself back then,

323
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,702
I still remember the way.

324
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:40,613
So, this is a view
from Rin-chan's memories.

325
00:18:54,199 --> 00:18:56,405
18:59.

326
00:18:56,407 --> 00:18:58,087
Almost time for the lights to come on.

327
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,014
There it is!

328
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:26,097
See you tomorrow, Rin-chan.

329
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
See you tomorrow
at the cherry blossom viewing camp.

330
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:30,992
Sakura-san,

331
00:19:30,993 --> 00:19:32,602
are you taking the highway back?

332
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:35,275
Yes, since we're close
to the Katsunuma interchange.

333
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,499
They should be lighting up
the Daimonji tonight.

334
00:19:39,598 --> 00:19:41,910
You should be able to see it
on the left side on the way back.

335
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,999
Thank you, I'll keep an eye out.

336
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,904
Since Sakura will be driving,

337
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:49,499
I'll make sure to capture it perfectly.

338
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:59,087
Drive safely, Rin-chan!

339
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:02,306
All right. We're leaving.

340
00:20:02,308 --> 00:20:03,404
Okay.

341
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,503
The night view of the basin
really is beautiful.

342
00:20:17,903 --> 00:20:20,893
Haven't you had your fill
of the torii gate burning earlier?

343
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:23,800
Watching it from the car
has its own charm, doesn't it?

344
00:20:25,207 --> 00:20:28,695
We must be getting close
to the Daimonji that Rin-chan mentioned.

345
00:20:28,696 --> 00:20:29,992
You might miss it.

346
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:31,394
I know.

347
00:20:32,704 --> 00:20:34,998
There's Daimonji!

348
00:20:52,608 --> 00:20:53,800
This is…

349
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:58,593
…more like "Omonji".

350
00:21:00,113 --> 00:21:02,206
If we were a bit further away,

351
00:21:02,207 --> 00:21:03,993
I could have gotten a better shot.

352
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,300
Then let's come back next year
during cherry blossom season.

353
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:51,593
I'm saved!

354
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:55,110
Thanks for coming to pick me up
right after work.

355
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:56,192
No worries.

356
00:22:56,193 --> 00:22:57,207
But I'm impressed, Aoi.

357
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,709
It's your first time riding on a road bike

358
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,500
and you went so far.

359
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:04,698
You were a road cyclist too,
weren't you, Dad?

360
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:07,130
How far have you ridden before?

361
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:11,989
I've only done cross-country biking
for commuting.

362
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:14,114
But Aunty said…

363
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:17,905
What's the date today?

364
00:23:17,906 --> 00:23:19,400
Pranked you!

365
00:23:19,401 --> 00:23:21,191
She got you.

366
00:23:22,295 --> 00:23:24,406
I completely forgot it's April 1st today!

367
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:36,394
NEXT EPISODE:
2ND APRIL CHERRY BLOSSOM VIEWING CAMP

368

369
00:23:37,003 --> 00:23:37,607
