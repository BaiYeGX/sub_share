1
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:07,141
I've been tossing and turning

2
00:00:07,693 --> 00:00:10,000
in my tent for an hour or so.

3
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,802
Inuko's gone home.

4
00:00:12,803 --> 00:00:14,895
See you tomorrow.

5
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:17,999
Dinner was simple with cup rice.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,809
The Hayashi rice was delicious!

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,102
Then…

8
00:00:21,103 --> 00:00:25,690
Drinking cocoa and watching the sunrise
while solo-camping is the best thing ever!

9
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:28,401
So, I decided to follow Nadeshiko's advice

10
00:00:28,402 --> 00:00:31,197
and went to bed early in my sleeping bag.

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,197
But after those day campers left,

12
00:00:34,198 --> 00:00:36,401
I was the only one left in this campsite.

13
00:00:36,402 --> 00:00:39,593
There wasn't a single streetlight around,

14
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:42,005
and the sky was covered by thick clouds,

15
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:44,199
making the campsite completely dark.

16
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:46,104
And that's when

17
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:48,401
I had the urge to use the loo.

18
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:51,609
But since I didn't want to fumble around
in the dark to get to the toilet,

19
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,912
I kept squirming in my sleeping bag.

20
00:00:55,904 --> 00:00:57,098
Then, a strange noise

21
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,313
started coming from somewhere.

22
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:02,894
I thought I'd wait until the noise stopped
so I could go,

23
00:01:02,895 --> 00:01:06,407
but I ended up waiting
for over 30 minutes!

24
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:12,511
Now, I'm on the verge
of breaking through my limits!

25
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:28,198
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

26
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:45,588
EPISODE 12
2ND APRIL CHERRY BLOSSOM VIEWING CAMP

27
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,411
This rustling sound…

28
00:02:47,412 --> 00:02:50,130
Based on my camping experience,

29
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:53,411
I knew it was definitely not
the sound of the tent swaying in the wind.

30
00:02:53,412 --> 00:02:56,901
It was clearly an animal.

31
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:59,505
The animals that could be around here

32
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:05,406
include raccoons, civets,
deer, monkeys, boars,

33
00:03:05,407 --> 00:03:06,598
and bears!

34
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,353
It's fine if it's just a raccoon,

35
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,097
but what if it's a boar or a bear?
What will I do then?

36
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,999
"BEWARE OF BEARS IN NAMBU"
Was there a bear sign

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,597
in this town?

38
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,005
I remember the toilet
is about 20 metres from here.

39
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:20,891
I could slowly make my way there.

40
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,610
If I run into a bear,

41
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,376
I must never make eye contact.

42
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:29,203
I should avoid looking it in the eyes
and slowly back away

43
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:31,802
and create distance between us…

44
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:34,381
And I'd surely wet myself.

45
00:03:34,693 --> 00:03:36,797
I should just make a run for it

46
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:39,300
and lock myself in the toilet!

47
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:40,115
No.

48
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:42,704
If I do that,
I'll be stuck in there until dawn.

49
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:46,698
Plus, the toilet didn't look that sturdy.

50
00:03:48,198 --> 00:03:50,291
If a bear attacks,

51
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,287
-I'd have no way to defend myself.
-Roar!

52
00:04:02,303 --> 00:04:05,001
Oh… It was just these cats…

53
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:13,057
I feel sleepy after being
liberated both physically and mentally.

54
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:14,604
So cold…

55
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:16,798
There's nothing else to do anyway.
I should go to sleep.

56
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,303
It's from Rin.

57
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:23,199
What's this link?

58
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:25,794
"YOU CAN SEE THE MAGLEV TRAIN FROM THIS HILL"
This looks like a live camera feed.

59
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:27,010
"MT. HANATORI IPPONSUGI PARK WEBCAM"
This looks like a live camera feed.

60
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,709
Mt. Hanatori?

61
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:33,208
Creepy!

62
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,900
That scared the heck out of me!

63
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,911
I figured you'd be bored at your camp.

64
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,807
It's a little early,
but I'm getting ready for bed now.

65
00:04:41,808 --> 00:04:43,999
How are things on your side?

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,802
I took it easy.

67
00:04:45,803 --> 00:04:47,916
It's a nice place

68
00:04:47,917 --> 00:04:49,801
with some cherry blossoms.
Not a lot, but some.

69
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,312
In the mountains of Fujikawa, right?

70
00:04:52,313 --> 00:04:53,687
Yeah.

71
00:04:53,688 --> 00:04:58,208
I even made tomato pasta
with the Akeno tomatoes you all gave me.

72
00:04:58,209 --> 00:04:59,604
It was really delicious.

73
00:04:59,605 --> 00:05:02,383
You used them for pasta?

74
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:03,905
Sounds divine.

75
00:05:03,907 --> 00:05:05,812
The tomatoes taste good raw,

76
00:05:05,813 --> 00:05:09,307
but cooking them makes them
even sweeter and flavourful!

77
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:10,309
I know what you mean.

78
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:13,307
How's your campsite?

79
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:14,510
Just like you said,

80
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:16,098
there are a lot of cherry blossoms,

81
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,510
and it's pretty empty.

82
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:19,005
Definitely a hidden gem.

83
00:05:19,006 --> 00:05:22,105
So hidden that I'm the only one here now.

84
00:05:23,405 --> 00:05:25,098
So today, I spent a leisurely day

85
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:27,593
watching cherry blossoms
and drinking Saratoga Coolers.

86
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,098
What's that?

87
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:31,500
A mocktail made
by mixing lime juice and ginger ale.

88
00:05:32,795 --> 00:05:35,594
I have some ingredients left,
so I'll make it for you tomorrow.

89
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:38,203
Looking forward to it.

90
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:40,015
Oh, also,

91
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:43,401
Inuko rode her road bike
over to my place this evening.

92
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:47,537
By the way,
what are you doing in such a dark place?

93
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:51,198
Aren't you at a place
called Mt. Hanatori right now?

94
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,698
I'm on my way home.

95
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,296
The cherry blossoms here
are lit up at night,

96
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:56,813
so I took a brief detour.

97
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,813
They're stunning!
I didn't know there was a spot like this.

98
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:04,302
I'm glad you're enjoying your solo camp.

99
00:06:04,303 --> 00:06:07,694
I think I get why you like
solo-camping so much now.

100
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:10,911
Well, I should head home.

101
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,401
Be careful not to catch a cold.

102
00:06:12,402 --> 00:06:14,609
You too. Take care on your way back.

103
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,417
See you tomorrow.

104
00:06:18,799 --> 00:06:20,303
What's this now?

105
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:25,593
Isn't this the thing

106
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:29,682
they light up every spring?

107
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:32,214
So you can watch
the live camera feed of it too.

108
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:39,510
It's beautiful.

109
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:47,693
All right.

110
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:52,303
I'd better head home
before I catch a cold.

111
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:04,598
It's a sea of cherry blossoms!

112
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:07,713
It's the perfect spot
for our cherry blossom viewing camp.

113
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:09,016
Indeed.

114
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:12,687
Aki-chan!

115
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:14,401
Oh, there they come.

116
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:17,093
Thanks for coming early
to save us a spot, Aki-chan.

117
00:07:17,094 --> 00:07:19,808
There's plenty of space even if I didn't.

118
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:22,505
Hey, Aki-chan!

119
00:07:22,506 --> 00:07:25,401
Well, well, Chibi Inuko tagged along too.

120
00:07:25,402 --> 00:07:28,006
I heard you were having a barbecue.

121
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,610
So you came for the meat, huh?

122
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:34,807
This is the second time
we've all come camping together

123
00:07:34,808 --> 00:07:36,598
since the Izu Camp.

124
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,906
You're right.

125
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:38,916
All right!

126
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:41,999
Now that everyone's here,

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,207
the cherry blossom viewing camp can begin!

128
00:07:44,209 --> 00:07:46,214
Let's start!

129
00:07:58,506 --> 00:07:59,604
Ms. Toba,

130
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:02,313
you said to leave the food
for the camp to you.

131
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:03,815
So, we're having a barbecue?

132
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:06,709
That's right. But specifically,

133
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:08,994
we're having Jingisukan (Genghis Khan).

134
00:08:08,995 --> 00:08:11,698
Yay! Jingisukan!

135
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,906
You like Jingisukan, Akari?

136
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:20,619
At our house, we have Jingisukan
for dinner about three times a month.

137
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,296
That's quite often.

138
00:08:23,297 --> 00:08:24,708
So our family has high standards

139
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:27,098
for Jingisukan.

140
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:28,906
Right, Aoi?

141
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,516
Maybe.

142
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:33,692
I saw it on TV.

143
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:36,234
Apparently,
those in Hokkaido enjoy Jingisukan

144
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:38,312
while viewing cherry blossoms,

145
00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:40,393
and I thought it sounded great.

146
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,578
I've heard that too.

147
00:08:43,579 --> 00:08:45,395
"PORK, LAMB"
And for Jingisukan,

148
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:48,104
all you need to do is
marinate the meat in the sauce.

149
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:51,912
Even if you're too tipsy
to see straight, it's no problem.

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,093
Ms. Toba is as lively as ever today.

151
00:08:56,094 --> 00:09:00,812
Anyway, I've marinated both
the lamb and pork in the sauce.

152
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:03,895
For anyone who doesn't like lamb,
there's pork.

153
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:05,098
Additionally,

154
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:09,506
besides Jingisukan,
I bought an unusual type of meat today.

155
00:09:10,397 --> 00:09:13,094
This may come as a surprise to you girls,

156
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:14,499
but ta-da!

157
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,595
CROAK

158
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,203
"SELF-CENSORED"
Frog meat.

159
00:09:17,204 --> 00:09:18,901
F… Frog?

160
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:20,859
Why… Why would you buy this?

161
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,098
That's real frog meat.

162
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:24,703
Well…

163
00:09:24,704 --> 00:09:26,708
I thought, since we have a chance
to have Jingisukan,

164
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:29,395
why not buy the meat
from a speciality shop?

165
00:09:29,396 --> 00:09:30,499
"TAKABAYASHI MEATS"
So I went

166
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,396
to a meat speciality store
in Fujikawa Town.

167
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:33,146
OSTRICH, FROG

168
00:09:33,147 --> 00:09:34,598
"RATTLESNAKE, CROCODILE"
Turns out,

169
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:37,700
they also sell exotic meats.

170
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:40,698
Rattlesnake and crocodile…

171
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:43,395
I was recommended the frog meat.
They said it tastes like chicken

172
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:45,500
and should be easier for you guys,

173
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,994
so I bought it.

174
00:09:46,995 --> 00:09:50,692
If it tastes like chicken,
why not just eat chicken?

175
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:53,406
As the visual was unpleasantly of a frog,

176
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,204
the meat was quickly battered
and deep-fried.

177
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:58,708
Taste test.

178
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:00,906
Tastes like regular fried chicken.

179
00:10:00,907 --> 00:10:02,109
It's pretty good, actually.

180
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:02,902
But the fact

181
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,708
my mind keeps reminding me
that this is frog

182
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:07,610
makes it hard for me to really enjoy it.

183
00:10:09,406 --> 00:10:10,797
You took the words right out of my mouth.

184
00:10:14,494 --> 00:10:17,963
Actually, I'm not a big fan of lamb.

185
00:10:17,964 --> 00:10:21,698
Why not, Ena?

186
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:25,296
I don't really like
that gameyness, I suppose.

187
00:10:25,297 --> 00:10:29,260
Aoi, is Jingisukan "gamey"?

188
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:30,895
Beats me.

189
00:10:30,896 --> 00:10:33,698
We've been eating it since we were little.

190
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,199
Maybe we're just used to it.

191
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:39,130
Tuck in, everyone!

192
00:10:39,131 --> 00:10:41,402
I'm digging in!

193
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:43,416
It looks so good!

194
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:45,901
Put the vegetables at the bottom

195
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:48,151
and then grill the meat on top,

196
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:50,210
the meat juices will drip down

197
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,291
and the veggies will soak up
all the meat juices.

198
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,589
Akari, you sure know a lot.

199
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:56,904
It's so delicious!

200
00:10:56,905 --> 00:10:58,489
Lamb is so tasty!

201
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,411
The pork goes perfectly
with the sauce! So good!

202
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,605
Scrumptious!

203
00:11:04,604 --> 00:11:07,206
It's quite nice, enjoying Jingisukan

204
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:09,099
while flower viewing.

205
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:11,792
Let's do this again next year!

206
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,438
Huh?

207
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:15,407
What's wrong, you two?

208
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:20,198
CALLING GRANDMA

209
00:11:21,007 --> 00:11:22,889
Hello? Grandma?

210
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,703
We're camping right now,

211
00:11:24,704 --> 00:11:27,199
and we're having Jingisukan.

212
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:31,398
But I thought it tasted completely different
from what we normally have at home.

213
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:33,079
Then,

214
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:34,505
"PORK"
Ms. Toba brought out another bag

215
00:11:34,507 --> 00:11:38,599
of pork marinated in the Jingisukan sauce.

216
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:41,099
When we had that,

217
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,204
we realised that was the taste
we knew of Jingisukan…

218
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:47,010
So,

219
00:11:47,011 --> 00:11:49,214
you have found out, Aoi.

220
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:51,603
The truth is, for generations,

221
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,604
the Jingisukan in our family
has always been made with…

222
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,303
…pork.

223
00:11:58,897 --> 00:12:01,302
Grand.. Grandma!

224
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,402
You lied to us all this time?

225
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,698
Calm down, Aoi.

226
00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:09,692
The world is full of lies.

227
00:12:09,693 --> 00:12:11,099
Do you know?

228
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,745
The yakitori bentos sold in Hokkaido
aren't actually made with chicken.

229
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:17,491
They use pork instead.

230
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:21,989
What is wrong with this world?

231
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,511
You two better hurry up
or we'll finish the meat.

232
00:12:43,777 --> 00:12:44,832
TO: AYA-CHAN
THE FLOWERS ARE IN FULL BLOOM.

233
00:12:44,856 --> 00:12:45,522
AYA-CHAN: THEY'RE SO PRETTY!

234
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,995
Akari's sound asleep.

235
00:13:05,996 --> 00:13:08,267
Well, she was running all over the place.

236
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:11,803
Still,

237
00:13:13,302 --> 00:13:16,699
it's pitch black here at night
since there are no streetlights.

238
00:13:17,594 --> 00:13:18,791
In that case,

239
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:20,094
how about using this?

240
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:23,838
I have one too!

241
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,093
I brought mine as well.

242
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:27,104
Geez,

243
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,110
you guys should've
brought them out sooner!

244
00:13:34,193 --> 00:13:36,611
Putting all these lights together
really creates a different ambience.

245
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:40,203
What's up?

246
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:42,808
Everyone, come here with your lanterns!

247
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:55,208
What a sight!

248
00:13:58,006 --> 00:13:59,902
Oh, that looks comfy.

249
00:14:04,402 --> 00:14:06,220
It's so beautiful…

250
00:14:08,006 --> 00:14:11,611
I never thought you could enjoy
cherry blossoms this way.

251
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:14,912
Get ready.

252
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:23,302
My album's filled to the brim
with cherry blossoms.

253
00:14:23,303 --> 00:14:24,609
Same.

254
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,511
Hey, hey…

255
00:14:25,512 --> 00:14:29,203
Let's each show
the best cherry blossom picture we have.

256
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:30,802
Good idea!

257
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:32,610
Which one should I choose?

258
00:14:33,293 --> 00:14:34,819
Ready when you guys are.

259
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,709
Ready!

260
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:41,906
Ena chose a picture with Chikuwa.

261
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:42,798
That's right.

262
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,515
Chikuwa's so cute!

263
00:14:45,516 --> 00:14:47,599
Where was this, Rin?

264
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,104
Mt. Fuji in the background

265
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:51,010
makes these cherry blossoms
look even more spectacular.

266
00:14:51,011 --> 00:14:53,401
This was a place
called Tokakyo Park, I think.

267
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,890
I discovered it by chance
while biking to see cherry blossoms.

268
00:14:55,891 --> 00:14:58,495
That's the essence
of cherry blossom viewing by bike.

269
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:01,005
Aki's cherry blossoms look unique too.

270
00:15:01,006 --> 00:15:03,114
They actually bloom on the trunk!

271
00:15:03,115 --> 00:15:04,011
Yeah.

272
00:15:04,012 --> 00:15:06,302
I think they call them "doufuki sakura".

273
00:15:06,303 --> 00:15:08,213
I like them
because they look strong and lively.

274
00:15:08,214 --> 00:15:10,916
Aoi, your whole screen is pink!

275
00:15:10,917 --> 00:15:13,286
Those are cherry blossoms near my house.

276
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,709
They've grown so big
that I can't fit them all into one photo.

277
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,802
The only issue is

278
00:15:17,803 --> 00:15:19,209
Nadeshiko's photo.

279
00:15:19,693 --> 00:15:21,307
Those cherry blossoms
haven't even bloomed yet!

280
00:15:21,308 --> 00:15:23,105
That's what you all think, hm?

281
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:25,496
I'll show you a magic trick!

282
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:36,093
They bloomed!

283
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:37,213
For real?

284
00:15:37,214 --> 00:15:38,698
Amazing!

285
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,698
Are those cherry blossoms
on the way to school?

286
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:42,501
They sure are.

287
00:15:42,502 --> 00:15:44,604
I take photos of them
every time I pass by.

288
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:46,111
When did you start taking them?

289
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:48,500
Around early March.

290
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:50,302
At first, there was no change at all,

291
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:53,605
but then they all bloomed at once.

292
00:15:55,693 --> 00:15:57,407
And it didn't end there.

293
00:15:57,904 --> 00:15:58,699
I continued taking photos

294
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,198
until the cherry blossoms fell

295
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:02,500
and new green leaves sprouted.

296
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:05,496
Nadeshiko always
does things out of the box.

297
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:10,303
I never expected such a big change
in just a few weeks.

298
00:16:11,298 --> 00:16:14,109
That's right!
We need to make some changes too!

299
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,006
What are you going on about?

300
00:16:17,499 --> 00:16:18,407
After this spring break,

301
00:16:18,408 --> 00:16:20,802
we'll be in second year.

302
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:22,786
It'll also be the second year
since our club was established.

303
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:24,516
That's why…

304
00:16:26,204 --> 00:16:27,145
"OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES CLUB"
We have to become an official club

305
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,110
"OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES CLUB"
no matter what!

306
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:29,995
We'll finally upgrade

307
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:31,302
to a full-fledged club.

308
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:32,901
Club activities!

309
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:35,526
But what are the benefits
of becoming an official club?

310
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:37,000
Well…

311
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:39,896
I can't drink anymore.

312
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:41,010
Generally,

313
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:42,807
we can apply for club funding,

314
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:44,406
and with more club members,

315
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:47,495
we may be able to get a bigger clubroom.

316
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:50,307
Our current one is small and cosy,

317
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:51,401
but with more members,

318
00:16:51,402 --> 00:16:53,609
we'll get to do even more activities.

319
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,192
Exactly!

320
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:58,104
So we must do our best
to get more members!

321
00:17:00,696 --> 00:17:02,505
Everyone, put out your lanterns!

322
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:03,791
Why?

323
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't ask questions.

324
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:06,912
Ready? Let's do it!

325
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,232
Not only did we get to see
the night cherry blossoms,

326
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:20,693
but we got to see the full moon too.

327
00:17:28,192 --> 00:17:30,105
Beautiful.

328
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:09,302
You're up early, Rin-chan.

329
00:18:09,303 --> 00:18:10,396
Morning.

330
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:11,517
Want some cocoa?

331
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:13,800
Sure.

332
00:18:19,787 --> 00:18:20,682
Here you go.

333
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,907
Thanks.

334
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:28,500
I enjoyed solo-camping
and camping with you and Aya-chan,

335
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:30,807
but it's fun to go camping
with everyone together too.

336
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:31,808
Yeah.

337
00:18:38,594 --> 00:18:42,005
Thanks for inviting me.

338
00:18:42,907 --> 00:18:45,506
Next time, it's my turn.

339
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,797
Timing is everything, isn't it?

340
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:54,303
Nade…

341
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:55,204
Rin-chan.

342
00:18:56,498 --> 00:18:58,094
Where should we go next time?

343
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:03,703
I heard from Sakura

344
00:19:03,704 --> 00:19:06,802
that there's a railway heritage park
in Gunma.

345
00:19:06,803 --> 00:19:09,517
What do you think of a retro train camp?

346
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,703
So, they have a railway heritage park.

347
00:19:14,704 --> 00:19:17,192
Seems like camping in Gunma
would be interesting.

348
00:19:17,193 --> 00:19:18,099
Right?

349
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,099
I want to go to Saitama too.

350
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,500
I live so close to it,
but I've never been there.

351
00:19:24,501 --> 00:19:27,095
I heard there's a shrine
dedicated to wolves there.

352
00:19:28,703 --> 00:19:30,416
When the weather warms up a bit,

353
00:19:30,417 --> 00:19:32,420
I also want to visit northern Nagano.

354
00:19:33,197 --> 00:19:34,896
And have soba noodles in Togakushi.

355
00:19:34,897 --> 00:19:37,203
Or go a bit further north to Niigata.

356
00:19:37,204 --> 00:19:41,302
Preparing camp meals with seafood
from the Sea of Japan sounds nice too.

357
00:19:41,303 --> 00:19:42,912
Niigata, huh?

358
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:46,515
There are several well-known
camping gear manufacturers there.

359
00:19:46,516 --> 00:19:49,006
Might be fun checking them out.

360
00:19:49,994 --> 00:19:51,689
For camping enthusiasts,

361
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,793
Niigata is the sacred land.

362
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,109
They've got Lake Inawashiro

363
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,307
in Fukushima too.

364
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:00,105
It's famous in the camping world.

365
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:04,599
Grandpa told me about Mt. Bandai
next to that lake.

366
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,605
It's a beautiful hiking spot.

367
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:08,995
Let's invite Aya-chan to go together

368
00:20:08,996 --> 00:20:11,208
and have another motorbike camping trip!

369
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:15,313
Shizuoka to Fukushima
is a bit far though, isn't it?

370
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,500
All right.

371
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,100
Oh no! I'm going to be late!

372
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,401
Cycling to school is pretty nice.

373
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:24,495
Culinary club!

374
00:22:24,496 --> 00:22:26,771
Let's get creative with cooking!

375
00:22:26,772 --> 00:22:28,405
-We're the calligraphy club.
-Put your blood, tears, and sweat in Judo!

376
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:29,505
This is the swim club!

377
00:22:29,506 --> 00:22:31,593
We're aiming for nationals!

378
00:22:31,594 --> 00:22:33,505
Everyone's so competitive.

379
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:36,791
Have you decided
which club you want to join?

380
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:38,192
Not yet.

381
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:40,406
They don't seem
to have an illustration club here.

382
00:22:40,407 --> 00:22:41,599
I see…

383
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,604
Judo!

384
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:43,600
Calligraphy!

385
00:22:43,601 --> 00:22:45,100
Culinary!

386
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:48,922
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES CLUB

387
00:22:48,923 --> 00:22:51,114
Come and camp with us!

388
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:53,000
We're the Outdoor Activities Club!

389
00:22:53,001 --> 00:22:54,595
Our target: to become an official club!

390
00:22:54,597 --> 00:22:55,838
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES CLUB

391
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:56,901
All done!

392
00:22:56,902 --> 00:22:58,292
All that's left is
to colour this and use it

393
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,005
to recruit the new first years.

394
00:23:00,006 --> 00:23:02,713
I'll go borrow some art supplies
from the art club.

395
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,105
You can do that after school…

396
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:18,901
Rin-chan!

397
00:23:18,902 --> 00:23:20,902
Good morning!

398
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:23,605
Good morning, Nadeshiko.

399
00:23:32,803 --> 00:23:35,807
You're in a good mood
this morning, Nadeshiko.

400
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh, don't mind me. It's nothing.
