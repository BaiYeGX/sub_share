1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,464
IKAWA

2
00:00:06,005 --> 00:00:08,500
Wow, we're really driving dangerously.

3
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:11,402
We're completely on the edge of the cliff.

4
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:14,906
Hey, Miss, are you alone?

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,500
Want to share some snacks?

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,604
Can I?

7
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:22,323
POTATO CRISPS

8
00:00:22,704 --> 00:00:24,808
Try some of mine too.

9
00:00:37,292 --> 00:00:41,146
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

10
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,710
EPISODE 4:
JOURNEY TO HATANAGI AND THE ROAD TO HELL

11
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:01,397
So you guys came from Mie?

12
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:03,304
We're headed to a hidden gem in Oshizu.

13
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:07,710
We had planned to wait until early April
when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom,

14
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,403
but this one here hates crowds,

15
00:02:10,403 --> 00:02:11,710
so we decided to come this week instead.

16
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:14,299
If everyone's there,
it's no more a hidden gem, no?

17
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:17,721
Where are you getting off?

18
00:02:17,722 --> 00:02:19,804
We're going all the way to the end, Ikawa.

19
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:23,101
I'll be getting off at a place
called Abt-Ichishiro Station

20
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,205
and then walking to the nearby campsite.

21
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:26,705
Are you going camping?

22
00:02:27,297 --> 00:02:28,990
We tried camping near our hometown

23
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:32,400
in January, just to follow the trend.

24
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,902
Yeah.

25
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,503
We forgot the fuel for the heater
and almost froze to death.

26
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:41,002
When you come to Mie for a visit,

27
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:42,413
you should check it out.

28
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:44,204
Even though that campsite
is at the tip of Shima,

29
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,398
it's a great spot.

30
00:02:47,997 --> 00:02:49,705
The tip of Shima.

31
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:53,807
The campsite at the tip of Rin (Shima).

32
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:57,693
Approaching Abt-Ichishiro Station.

33
00:02:58,505 --> 00:02:59,203
We're here.

34
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,099
Well then, this is my stop.

35
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,906
Aren't you going to stay for the linking?

36
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:05,510
Linking?

37
00:03:06,205 --> 00:03:08,994
The road up ahead is steep,

38
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:11,399
so, they're going to attach
a ABT rack rail train here.

39
00:03:13,197 --> 00:03:14,104
I'm here.

40
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:14,993
Hello.

41
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:15,813
Hello.

42
00:03:17,693 --> 00:03:18,511
-It'll push the whole train
-We got this!

43
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:20,500
-from behind.
-We got this!

44
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:24,296
It's said that underneath its carriage,
there are gears installed,

45
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,904
allowing it to climb upward
using the force

46
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,511
generated by the gears
engaging with the track.

47
00:03:30,406 --> 00:03:31,802
Linking.

48
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:35,900
Apparently, you can only
witness this here in all of Japan.

49
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:38,109
Train enthusiasts must be thrilled.

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,005
But you're not a train enthusiast.

51
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,803
You take care of yourself, Miss.

52
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,402
You guys too.

53
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:51,897
WATCH OUT FOR ONCOMING TRAINS

54
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:54,204
Amusing ladies, those two.

55
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:59,808
Let's see. To get to the campsite…

56
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,360
GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THE TUNNEL

57
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:02,501
This way.

58
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:10,303
That's a huge suspension bridge!

59
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,204
I wonder if Rin and Aya passed by here?

60
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:18,391
All right.
Let's check in at the campsite first

61
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:19,809
and get us a good spot.

62
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:21,599
"ABT-ICHISHIRO STATION"
After I put away my luggage,

63
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,198
"CAMPSITE"
I'll walk to Nagashima Dam Station

64
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,209
"NAGASHIMA DAM STATION"
and take the train to Okuoikojo Station.

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,584
The next train from Nagashima Dam Station
departs at 14:32.

66
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,006
Just over an hour left
until the next train.

67
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:35,610
I better hurry!

68
00:04:43,501 --> 00:04:46,011
"Go straight through the tunnel", as in…

69
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:53,199
Must… Must I go through this tunnel

70
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,105
to get to the campsite?

71
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,402
Bats!

72
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:05,188
Can't see the light
at the end of the tunnel at all…

73
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:07,098
Just how long is this tunnel?

74
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,105
This is the time to clear your mind.

75
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,807
This is just an ordinary tunnel…

76
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:14,401
This is just an ordinary tunnel…

77
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:16,600
Just keep walking straight,
and you'll get out of here.

78
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:20,600
Finally, I can see the exit!

79
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:27,006
This is actually the old track
of the discontinued ABT railway line.

80
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:39,006
Now, it's called the "Obake Tunnel".

81
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,990
Many locals display decorations
of spirits and monsters

82
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:44,611
to scare visitors.

83
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,610
Check-out time is 11 AM.

84
00:05:48,611 --> 00:05:50,011
If you need to leave early in the morning,

85
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:52,407
just drop the guidebook into the mailbox.

86
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,611
Are you okay, young lady?

87
00:05:57,907 --> 00:05:59,292
After calming down

88
00:05:59,293 --> 00:06:01,611
and storing her luggage,
it's time to choose a camping spot.

89
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:06,298
Where should we choose?

90
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:08,897
Spot secured.

91
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,407
I'VE SECURED THE SPOT.
NOW, I'M GOING TO CHECK OUT THE "EGG".

92
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,199
40 minutes until the train leaves!

93
00:06:15,923 --> 00:06:17,297
THIS WAY TO CAMP ICHISHIRO

94
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:19,194
Let's see…

95
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:30,506
Nagashima Dam.

96
00:06:31,001 --> 00:06:33,001
It's ginormous!

97
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,303
So, based on the dam curry,

98
00:06:35,303 --> 00:06:37,209
that suspension bridge
is the fried shrimp.

99
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,152
I'm the fried shrimp.

100
00:06:38,153 --> 00:06:40,292
That dam's the rice.

101
00:06:40,293 --> 00:06:41,204
I'm the rice.

102
00:06:41,205 --> 00:06:43,600
And the other side of the dam

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,605
is filled with curry!

104
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,797
The area around the dam
looks just like the mortar and pestle.

105
00:06:52,798 --> 00:06:55,105
Reminds me of Mount Omuro.

106
00:06:55,803 --> 00:06:57,105
MOUNT OMURO

107
00:07:07,516 --> 00:07:09,500
MINISTRY OF LAND,
INFRASTRUCTURE, TRANSPORT AND TOURISM

108
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:15,506
Never mind.

109
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:19,645
THE DREAMS NURTURED BY WATER
AND THE BEAUTY OF GREENERY AND NATURE

110
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,273
NAGASHIMA DAM

111
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,803
So high!

112
00:07:31,496 --> 00:07:35,616
It's amazing how humans can build
such enormous structures.

113
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,501
Ah! The train's here!

114
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,505
Wait for me!

115
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,605
Barely made it…

116
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:50,808
If I had gotten off here,

117
00:07:50,808 --> 00:07:53,397
I probably wouldn't have had
to go through that tunnel.

118
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,193
Thank you for your patience.

119
00:07:55,194 --> 00:07:56,408
This train is about to depart.

120
00:07:56,803 --> 00:07:59,803
The next stop is Hiranda Station.

121
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:05,897
Off to Okuoikojo Station!
Destination, boiled egg!

122
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:09,027
LAKE IKAWA

123
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,603
That was an awful ride!

124
00:08:13,308 --> 00:08:15,285
As dangerous as that road was,

125
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,600
I couldn't help but laugh.

126
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,694
After making those twists and turns
with confidence…

127
00:08:23,308 --> 00:08:24,412
Hello!

128
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,297
That was really risky.

129
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:37,704
I can just about keep up only because
I ride regularly. Thank goodness.

130
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:41,209
Reminds me of those slippery road signs.

131
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,802
It's been a bumpy ride

132
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:45,511
since Lake Sesso.

133
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,918
It definitely lives up
to its moniker, "the road to hell".

134
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,210
That'll be 319 yen for 2.2 litres.

135
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:53,615
Here's 320 yen.

136
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:55,501
Text from Nadeshiko.

137
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:58,808
I'VE SECURED THE SPOT.
NOW, I'M GOING TO CHECK OUT THE "EGG".

138
00:08:58,808 --> 00:08:59,788
What's that emoji supposed to mean?

139
00:09:00,194 --> 00:09:01,006
An egg?

140
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,199
Looks like she got there safely.
Good to know.

141
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,506
Nadeshiko's all grown up now.

142
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,907
Nothing. Nothing at all.

143
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:15,100
All right.
We should be on our way to Hatanagi.

144
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:25,407
Ikawa Bridge.

145
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:30,104
Is this the suspension bridge
you mentioned we could bike across?

146
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:31,298
Yep.

147
00:09:34,194 --> 00:09:36,408
The scenery here is lovely.

148
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:39,204
The lake's a beautiful green colour.

149
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:41,199
It's so peaceful here.

150
00:09:43,793 --> 00:09:47,194
This "road to hell"
is longer and tougher than I thought.

151
00:09:47,601 --> 00:09:48,907
"Road to hell"?

152
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:51,689
We've got a ways to go
before we reach Hatanagi.

153
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:56,007
I'm hungry, Rin.
Why don't we get something to eat first?

154
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:58,407
Before we set out, you said…

155
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:01,001
To make dinner even tastier,

156
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:02,699
let's skip lunch.

157
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:05,397
After all, an empty stomach
is the best seasoning, right?

158
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,006
Didn't you?

159
00:10:08,303 --> 00:10:09,116
Did I?

160
00:10:09,117 --> 00:10:10,293
I'm tired.

161
00:10:10,293 --> 00:10:11,605
Well, I don't mind either way.

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,112
But are there places
that sell food nearby?

163
00:10:14,696 --> 00:10:17,006
I think I remember seeing one
near the petrol station.

164
00:10:17,511 --> 00:10:21,605
About that, I checked on my phone
and found a nice place.

165
00:10:27,204 --> 00:10:29,511
The oden is hot and yummy!

166
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:31,006
This is what they call,
"starting a fire and then putting it out."

167
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:33,401
What fire?

168
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:35,298
N… No, it's nothing.

169
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:37,495
Here's some tea for you girls.

170
00:10:37,496 --> 00:10:38,402
Thank you.

171
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:40,704
Where are you two from?

172
00:10:41,306 --> 00:10:43,308
I'm from Hamamatsu.

173
00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,001
You certainly drove a long way.

174
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:47,995
That's impressive.

175
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:49,600
I'm from Minobu.

176
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,692
It's right next to Yamanashi,
but that's still quite the distance,

177
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:54,397
given all the mountain roads.

178
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:59,297
But I've gone through the Yamabushi Pass
to get to Kofu from Hayakawa myself.

179
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:03,297
You mean the road
that goes through Amehata?

180
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:04,792
That's right.

181
00:11:04,793 --> 00:11:05,798
Amehata?

182
00:11:06,595 --> 00:11:09,252
Yamanashi has a road
called Amehata Forest Road

183
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,288
that leads directly to Ikawa.

184
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,709
I went there at the end of January.

185
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:18,100
But now it's closed,
so we can't use it anymore.

186
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,709
When did you drive there?

187
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,286
Let me think.

188
00:11:22,287 --> 00:11:24,807
It was when I was still
taking care of my children.

189
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:27,297
It must have been about 30 years ago.

190
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:28,603
30 years?

191
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:31,106
They probably didn't have the money
to repair the road.

192
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:32,802
ODEN

193
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:33,912
BEER, SNACKS, GROCERIES, OPEN FOR BUSINESS

194
00:11:33,913 --> 00:11:35,599
Thank you for your hospitality.

195
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,905
Thank you, ladies.

196
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,313
Not only was the oden delicious,

197
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,280
but we also got to hear
some interesting tales of the past.

198
00:11:42,281 --> 00:11:43,610
It was well worth the stop.

199
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,303
The mountaintop is covered in snow.

200
00:11:50,304 --> 00:11:52,605
The altitude is higher up there.

201
00:11:52,605 --> 00:11:54,293
It's probably going to get even colder.

202
00:11:56,395 --> 00:11:58,801
How far is it from here to Lake Hatanagi?

203
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,704
Let me check.

204
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,501
Those guided by Guruguru Map

205
00:12:06,104 --> 00:12:09,203
should pass through
the scattered seven Tashiros

206
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:13,704
to reach the legendary lake.

207
00:12:14,298 --> 00:12:16,308
Why are you speaking
like an RPG character?

208
00:12:16,693 --> 00:12:18,110
And what are those "Tashiros"?

209
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:25,407
Guruguru Map sometimes leads you
through strange paths.

210
00:12:25,802 --> 00:12:26,704
I know that well.

211
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:33,766
TASHIRO TUNNEL 1, 500M

212
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,984
So the "Tashiros" refer
to the Tashiro Tunnels.

213
00:12:36,985 --> 00:12:38,203
Correct.

214
00:12:38,204 --> 00:12:39,011
One.

215
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:39,896
Two.

216
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:40,510
Three.

217
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,197
Four.

218
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:42,010
Five.

219
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,802
Six.

220
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:43,507
Seven.

221
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:45,110
Hatanagi.

222
00:12:45,111 --> 00:12:48,302
This route has a total
of seven Tashiro Tunnels.

223
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,411
Pass through all of them

224
00:12:49,412 --> 00:12:51,193
and we'll arrive at Lake Hatanagi.

225
00:12:51,807 --> 00:12:52,708
I see.

226
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,896
Off we go, then!

227
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,094
Okay.

228
00:13:00,208 --> 00:13:02,187
TASHIRO TUNNEL 2, 85M

229
00:13:06,214 --> 00:13:07,605
TASHIRO TUNNEL 3, 7M

230
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,010
TASHIRO TUNNEL 4, 63M

231
00:13:18,182 --> 00:13:19,349
TASHIRO TUNNEL 5, 35M

232
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:26,906
TASHIRO TUNNEL 6, 37M

233
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:45,620
TASHIRO TUNNEL 7, 161M

234
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,010
From Senzu,
the girls drove for about 45 kilometres.

235
00:14:02,406 --> 00:14:03,208
Rin.

236
00:14:04,905 --> 00:14:06,708
Arrived at Lake Hatanagi.

237
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:12,312
Finally here!

238
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:17,406
I can't go any further…

239
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:20,203
This isn't the kind of place
you can just come to casually.

240
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm really sorry for inviting you
to drive here carelessly.

241
00:14:26,896 --> 00:14:29,104
We made it at last.

242
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,703
Yeah.

243
00:14:31,406 --> 00:14:34,698
The Hatanagi Suspension Bridge
should be a little further ahead.

244
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:37,010
But they put up a sign.

245
00:14:37,011 --> 00:14:38,803
I don't think we can drive directly there.

246
00:14:43,302 --> 00:14:45,302
Come on.
Let's go to the suspension bridge.

247
00:14:45,807 --> 00:14:46,698
What?

248
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,192
It took so much effort to get here.
Forget about the suspension bridge.

249
00:14:50,193 --> 00:14:52,443
It's another 5KM walk from here
back and forth.

250
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:55,311
No way! We've come this far.

251
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:57,599
It would be a waste
not to go check it out!

252
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,106
I think you've totally lost it…

253
00:15:00,511 --> 00:15:02,108
Think about it.

254
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,504
If you change your mind and want
to check out that bridge next time,

255
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,999
you'll have to go through
that hellish road again.

256
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,005
Well… you do have a point…

257
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:21,901
Fine! I'll go! I'll do it!

258
00:15:25,298 --> 00:15:28,599
So, this is the deepest of Shizuoka
reachable by bike, huh?

259
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:32,698
To the suspension bridge?
That's quite far from here.

260
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:35,297
And the roads aren't exactly
in the best condition. Are you sure?

261
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,697
It's not too far of a walk.

262
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:38,900
We'll manage.

263
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:40,198
ACCESS PROHIBITED

264
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,395
Be careful.

265
00:15:41,396 --> 00:15:43,599
Let me know when you're back.

266
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,193
Got it.

267
00:15:48,104 --> 00:15:51,510
We've come all this way
through that hellish road.

268
00:15:51,511 --> 00:15:53,698
Little late for warnings, huh?

269
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:00,401
The road conditions
are even worse than before.

270
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:01,807
It's all muddy everywhere.

271
00:16:01,807 --> 00:16:04,510
When he said it isn't in the best condition,
he means these puddles and mud, huh?

272
00:16:05,202 --> 00:16:07,000
Guess we'll have to tread carefully…

273
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,411
…and push through.

274
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:15,411
So, your grandpa used to ride
a motorcycle, too?

275
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:19,214
He stopped since he got a bad back.

276
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:23,693
When I was little, I'd sit behind him,
and he'd drive me around.

277
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,906
Your grandpa drives a bike too, right?

278
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:31,604
That makes us

279
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:33,193
"GRANDDAUGHTER RIDERS"
the "granddaughter riders"!

280
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,906
Hey!

281
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:35,812
The heck is that?

282
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:41,302
I couldn't find any girls around me
who ride motorcycles,

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,807
so meeting a fellow rider like you
really makes me happy.

284
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,406
That's why you chose
such a dangerous route for our first trip?

285
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:53,599
Well, I like biking.

286
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:57,599
I wanted to challenge all kinds of roads.

287
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:05,307
You know, there are many girls in Yamanashi
who ride motorcycles to school.

288
00:17:05,307 --> 00:17:07,505
Oh, really?

289
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:10,904
Is that the suspension bridge
we're looking for?

290
00:17:12,207 --> 00:17:13,608
It looks like it,

291
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,297
but it seems like
there's still some way to go.

292
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:16,297
Yeah.

293
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:19,906
Hatanagi Suspension Bridge.

294
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:21,178
HATANAGI SUSPENSION BRIDGE
MAXIMUM CAPACITY: 15 PEOPLE

295
00:17:21,185 --> 00:17:21,771
PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN CROSSING

296
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:24,905
The footing is so narrow!

297
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:26,198
And the railing is thin!

298
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:28,593
And it's super high!

299
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,008
Approximately 30 metres above ground.

300
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:33,510
Well, we've come this far.

301
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:34,594
I think we can turn back now.

302
00:17:34,594 --> 00:17:37,209
You're the one who insisted
we come to this bridge!

303
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:41,599
I have serious concerns about this…

304
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,099
It's only secured with steel wires,

305
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:49,500
and it creaks with every step.
Feels like it could come loose any moment.

306
00:17:49,911 --> 00:17:51,901
And being deep in the mountains,

307
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:53,796
I doubt it gets much maintenance.

308
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:56,407
It makes you wonder
if a screw might suddenly

309
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,308
come loose or something.

310
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:03,202
You know how some people
accidentally drop their phones

311
00:18:03,203 --> 00:18:06,005
while taking aesthetic photos
in places like this?

312
00:18:12,185 --> 00:18:13,800
Yeah, instead of worrying
about dropping a phone,

313
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,299
I think we should be more concerned
about not losing our lives here.

314
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,595
Absolutely.

315
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:20,298
Ri… Rin,

316
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,804
I'm still really scared.
I think we should cross one at a time.

317
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:27,105
B-but we're already halfway across.

318
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,637
If we both go together,
what if the bridge collapses…?

319
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,497
It… It's shaking!

320
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:38,903
The bridge keeps swaying!

321
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,601
One way or another,
they made it to the other side.

322
00:18:50,398 --> 00:18:52,897
Beyond here is the mountain trail.

323
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,792
The brave ones will continue forward.

324
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:57,600
BEWARE OF BEARS

325
00:18:57,601 --> 00:18:58,710
Let's head back.

326
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,804
Right this instant.

327
00:19:00,897 --> 00:19:02,814
Don't shake, Rin!

328
00:19:03,688 --> 00:19:04,897
That's my line!

329
00:19:10,116 --> 00:19:13,053
OKUOI KOZYO

330
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:19,089
OKUOI KOZYO

331
00:19:23,823 --> 00:19:27,073
IKAWA

332
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:42,985
RAINBOW BRIDGE
KOZYO TRAIL

333
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:48,102
Okuoikojo Station.

334
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:51,907
It's amazing that they actually built
a station in such a location.

335
00:19:52,688 --> 00:19:55,600
That must be the boiled egg
in the dam curry.

336
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,704
Speaking of which,

337
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:01,312
the men taking photos here

338
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:03,412
are using some pretty high-end cameras.

339
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:06,297
So, those beautiful pictures we see online

340
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,901
are taken like this, huh?

341
00:20:09,097 --> 00:20:10,401
I'll join in

342
00:20:11,302 --> 00:20:12,302
and take a panoramic shot too.

343
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:18,401
Perfect.

344
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,724
HATANAGI VILLAGE
OPEN

345
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:26,406
Soaking my chilled body
in the hot spring is the best.

346
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:27,995
The best…

347
00:20:28,412 --> 00:20:31,505
The wonderful warmth is just fantastic.

348
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:34,818
I actually prefer it a bit hotter.

349
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:39,197
The texture of the water is so smooth,
and it's just the right temperature,

350
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:42,198
making it a warm and silky hot spring.

351
00:20:43,004 --> 00:20:47,131
Even if I were to melt in this water,
I wouldn't have any regrets.

352
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:49,802
About to melt away, huh?

353
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:57,104
I just thought of your expression
when we were crossing the bridge.

354
00:20:58,406 --> 00:21:02,005
As if you were any better.

355
00:21:03,094 --> 00:21:05,000
Although it was tiring and scary,

356
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:07,599
reaching the suspension bridge
was really great.

357
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:10,521
Yeah, it's good we made it.

358
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,391
34 kilometres back to the campsite.

359
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:26,911
I don't want to drive back!

360
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:04,604
We're heading to the campsite now.

361
00:23:05,101 --> 00:23:07,204
We'll be driving from Hatanagi.

362
00:23:07,604 --> 00:23:10,104
It'll take about two hours.

363
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:12,597
Roger that. Drive safely.

364
00:23:12,598 --> 00:23:13,792
Okay.

365
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:17,253
Two hours, huh? Sounds tough.

366
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:20,396
I guess I'll take it easy

367
00:23:20,396 --> 00:23:21,807
and head back to the campsite first.

368
00:23:27,911 --> 00:23:36,287
NEXT EPISODE: BONFIRE AND BEEF FEAST

369
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,041
WHEN ENJOYING CAMPING,
BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE RULES

370
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:37,596

371
00:23:37,596 --> 00:23:38,918
DON'T FORGET TO PUT OUT YOUR CAMPFIRE
AND DISPOSE OF YOUR GARBAGE.

372
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,221
