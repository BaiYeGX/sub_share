1
00:00:07,802 --> 00:00:09,300
All right. Let's head out.

2
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,396
If you're going to Kawane,

3
00:00:11,396 --> 00:00:12,708
bring back some Kawane tea.

4
00:00:13,104 --> 00:00:15,719
Mum hasn't been as worried about me
travelling lately.

5
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:17,203
Has she gotten used to it?

6
00:00:17,802 --> 00:00:18,698
But

7
00:00:18,698 --> 00:00:20,813
Grandpa did say
that you're most prone to making mistakes

8
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,198
when you get comfortable.

9
00:00:22,902 --> 00:00:24,917
I should keep my guard up.

10
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:43,208
LAID-BACK CAMP SEASON 3

11
00:01:58,496 --> 00:01:59,902
EPISODE 3: BRIDGE COUNTRY

12
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:01,199
It's 3.30 AM.

13
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:03,554
"KAWANE RYOGOKU"
I'm supposed to meet Aya

14
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:05,012
"KAWANE RYOGOKU"
at 8 AM at Senzu Station.

15
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:08,298
That should give me about 4.5 hours.

16
00:02:09,095 --> 00:02:10,296
We'll decide

17
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,605
where to go after we meet up.

18
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:14,298
"ABT-ICHISHIRO STATION"
As for Nadeshiko,

19
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,106
"ABT-ICHISHIRO STATION"
we're meeting her at the campsite.

20
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:17,804
But is she really okay
getting there alone?

21
00:02:19,101 --> 00:02:20,294
Morning, Rin.

22
00:02:21,106 --> 00:02:21,908
You're up early.

23
00:02:22,497 --> 00:02:25,205
Heard you're heading full throttle
to the hidden gem of Ikawa

24
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:28,814
with Nadeshiko's friend
from her hometown today.

25
00:02:29,497 --> 00:02:30,705
What era are you living in?

26
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:32,799
Speaking of Ikawa,

27
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:35,606
it's known for Kawane tea, hot springs,
and the suspension bridge, right?

28
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:37,299
I think so.

29
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:40,294
Also, there's that Kawane tea soft serve
they sell in front of Senzu Station.

30
00:02:40,294 --> 00:02:42,237
Heard it's a bit bitter,
but supposedly delicious.

31
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:44,116
Is that so?

32
00:02:44,809 --> 00:02:46,903
Remember to get me one.

33
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:49,601
By the time I get back to Minobu,
it'll be soup.

34
00:02:50,106 --> 00:02:52,096
Goodness!
Can't believe you won't buy it for me!

35
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:53,096
Unacceptable!

36
00:02:53,096 --> 00:02:54,507
-Unacceptable!
-Unacceptable!

37
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:56,403
You two are up bright and early too, huh?

38
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:02,205
It's starting to get light.

39
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,106
It's cold,

40
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:06,507
but it's nice to see

41
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:08,309
the sun rising.

42
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,304
"SUMATAKYO"
Mountain road from here on out, huh?

43
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:37,710
This is tough!

44
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:39,810
It's been nothing but hairpin turns!

45
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:41,205
Why do I keep

46
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:43,403
getting these road conditions?

47
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:53,237
HAMAMATSU

48
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:03,705
ONE-MAN

49
00:04:07,303 --> 00:04:08,502
Let's see...

50
00:04:09,903 --> 00:04:13,012
At Shizuoka Station, change to
the train bound for Hamamatsu Station.

51
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:15,007
From Kanaya Station,

52
00:04:15,007 --> 00:04:15,994
"ABT-ICHISHIRO STATION"
transfer to the Oigawa Railway

53
00:04:15,996 --> 00:04:17,111
"ABT-ICHISHIRO STATION"
to get to Senzu Station.

54
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:19,408
It's a long ride.

55
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,612
Gotta be careful not to forget
about the transfer.

56
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:28,705
Glad I didn't forget it.

57
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:34,200
I've been to Oigawa before.

58
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:36,398
Really? Was it fun?

59
00:04:37,703 --> 00:04:39,799
I went to the hot springs in Sumatakyo.

60
00:04:40,195 --> 00:04:41,507
It was nice.

61
00:04:42,913 --> 00:04:44,309
I went during maple leaf season.

62
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,609
There were so many people
on the suspension bridge

63
00:04:45,615 --> 00:04:46,309
that I was almost crushed.

64
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:48,200
Is it that bad?

65
00:04:48,695 --> 00:04:51,304
Well, the cherry blossoms
aren't in bloom yet.

66
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:52,309
It probably won't be that crowded.

67
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:54,309
Thank goodness.

68
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,106
Besides hot springs,

69
00:04:56,106 --> 00:04:57,171
there's also a foot bath cafe…

70
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,101
Hold up, Sakura.

71
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,200
I want to be surprised when I get there,

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,510
so no spoilers please.

73
00:05:05,502 --> 00:05:07,393
-I can't hear you...
-Hot spring. Foot bath.

74
00:05:07,393 --> 00:05:10,398
-I can't hear you...
-Wasabi soba.

75
00:05:10,804 --> 00:05:12,518
By the way, what's that?

76
00:05:13,102 --> 00:05:14,106
Oh, this?

77
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:19,304
"TRAVEL EGG CASE"
It's an egg case.

78
00:05:19,898 --> 00:05:21,804
I'm planning to make Omurice for dinner.

79
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:24,408
I bought this to carry the eggs.

80
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:27,106
Omurice doesn't sound

81
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:28,898
very camp-like.

82
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,355
Actually, it's because Aya said

83
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,200
she was bringing hamburg steak
from Hamamatsu.

84
00:05:33,603 --> 00:05:34,603
Hamburg steak?

85
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,903
That hamburg steak?

86
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:39,106
That's right. That hamburg steak.

87
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,867
It's not everyday we get to have that,

88
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:42,818
so I figured I'd whip up
a western-style dinner.

89
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:45,991
Now that you mention it,
we haven't had that hamburg steak

90
00:05:45,992 --> 00:05:48,607
since we moved to Yamanashi.

91
00:06:10,007 --> 00:06:11,705
Reached Senzu.

92
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,178
SENZU STATION

93
00:06:24,179 --> 00:06:27,913
SENZU HOT SPRINGS

94
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,507
SAKURAGI RELIGIOUS SUPPLIES STORE

95
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,205
Aya isn't here yet.

96
00:06:41,905 --> 00:06:44,504
TAXI STAND

97
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:52,322
Brr, it's cold.

98
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:54,510
"KAWANEHONCHO, SHIZUOKA"
It's warm at noon.

99
00:06:54,511 --> 00:06:55,416
"LOWEST TEMPERATURE: 3°C"
It's warm at noon.

100
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:56,904
But the temperature in the morning
and evening is colder than

101
00:06:56,905 --> 00:06:57,999
when we were camping in Izu.

102
00:06:58,803 --> 00:07:01,015
Nadeshiko is taking the train
to the campsite.

103
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:03,510
A nice, slow ride.

104
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:05,093
Leisurely, relaxing,

105
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:06,802
and she won't be tired.

106
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:12,312
There she comes.

107
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,218
Rin!

108
00:07:22,218 --> 00:07:23,296
Long time no…

109
00:07:24,937 --> 00:07:27,322
ALL BEAT UP

110
00:07:27,696 --> 00:07:29,541
SENZU STATION

111
00:07:30,093 --> 00:07:31,203
Better?

112
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:33,202
Much better.

113
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:37,113
Didn't expect just riding straight here
would be so brutal.

114
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:40,103
And the winds on National Route 1
are so strong.

115
00:07:40,103 --> 00:07:42,811
And those big trucks passing by
are terrifying.

116
00:07:43,301 --> 00:07:44,499
I get it.

117
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:47,598
Just riding a 100cc motorbike
is exhausting enough.

118
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,910
You, Rin, who rode a 50cc to Izu,
must be a maniac.

119
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:53,697
Hey, that's going too far.

120
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:57,494
We arrived way too early.

121
00:07:57,897 --> 00:07:59,910
None of the shops in front
of the station are open yet.

122
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:04,015
Heard the Kawane tea soft serve
at that shop is good.

123
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:05,713
Speaking of which,

124
00:08:05,713 --> 00:08:08,312
my parents asked me
to buy some Kawane tea.

125
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:09,702
Same here.

126
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:13,213
Let's swing by tomorrow
before heading home to buy some.

127
00:08:13,213 --> 00:08:14,114
Sounds good.

128
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:15,900
Did you bring all the gear over?

129
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,218
Pretty much everything.

130
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,307
Tents and sleeping bags
really take up space.

131
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:24,295
I also brought the famous hamburg steak
from Hamamatsu.

132
00:08:24,301 --> 00:08:26,108
Look forward to it.

133
00:08:27,213 --> 00:08:29,411
I've prepped the ingredients

134
00:08:29,411 --> 00:08:30,796
for my beef stew too.

135
00:08:31,202 --> 00:08:32,614
Can't wait!

136
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,416
But the hamburg steaks
are raw, aren't they?

137
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:38,309
Won't it go bad
if it's kept in the bag for so long?

138
00:08:38,907 --> 00:08:42,613
I froze it solid beforehand
and then put it in the cooler bag.

139
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:45,708
By evening, it should be thawed out.

140
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:47,405
I see.

141
00:08:48,109 --> 00:08:50,112
To make dinner even tastier,

142
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:51,807
let's skip lunch.

143
00:08:52,301 --> 00:08:54,603
After all, an empty stomach
is the best seasoning, right?

144
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,202
All right, then...

145
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:03,097
Time to set off.

146
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:04,207
Let's go.

147
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:05,807
Wait.

148
00:09:05,808 --> 00:09:08,109
We haven't even decided where to go yet.

149
00:09:08,703 --> 00:09:11,004
Let's just wander around
and ride until we reach Lake Hatanagi.

150
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,208
LAKE HATANAGI

151
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,807
Lake Hatanagi,

152
00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,496
the deepest lake accessible by drive

153
00:09:16,504 --> 00:09:19,212
among the many dam lakes on Oigawa.

154
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:23,812
The regional road 60 leads straight
to Lake Hatanagi.

155
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:26,702
Not only is the road surface uneven,
but it's also very rugged.

156
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:29,093
Hence, it's also known
as the "danger road."

157
00:09:29,807 --> 00:09:30,997
Are you serious?

158
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:32,306
Didn't you just collapse
from exhaustion earlier?

159
00:09:32,702 --> 00:09:34,098
And now we're riding into
the "danger road"...

160
00:09:34,098 --> 00:09:36,400
After a little rest, I'm fine now.

161
00:09:36,905 --> 00:09:38,201
Okay, let's go...

162
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:40,416
Are you sure you're okay?

163
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,604
The Oigawa Basin.

164
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:47,202
Known as "the land of suspension bridges."

165
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:48,902
"RYOGOKU NO TSURIBASHI"
Not only are there small bridges

166
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,895
"RYOGOKU NO TSURIBASHI"
for forestry,

167
00:09:50,213 --> 00:09:52,603
but also sturdy bridges
that can be driven across.

168
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:55,712
There are countless suspension bridges
throughout the entire Oigawa basin.

169
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:59,457
There are even more suspension bridges
than I thought.

170
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:03,509
Although the "Dream Suspension Bridge"
in Sumatakyo is the most famous,

171
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,410
there are others
that look pretty interesting too.

172
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:07,411
Like this one.

173
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,495
Seems we can ride our bikes up there.

174
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:12,903
It's normal to see bikers taking photos
and uploading them to social media.

175
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:13,702
Yo!

176
00:10:15,592 --> 00:10:16,812
So, Rin,

177
00:10:17,302 --> 00:10:19,103
on the way to Lake Hatanagi,

178
00:10:19,103 --> 00:10:21,207
let's make a detour whenever
we see a suspension bridge.

179
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:27,895
A suspension bridge tour, huh?

180
00:10:28,405 --> 00:10:30,207
Sounds interesting.

181
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,098
Huh?

182
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:40,403
What is it?

183
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:42,900
I see our next suspension bridge.

184
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,900
Already?

185
00:10:44,713 --> 00:10:46,312
Look. It's right over there.

186
00:10:47,197 --> 00:10:50,551
Two steel cables
hanging on that main pillar.

187
00:10:51,004 --> 00:10:52,593
You're right.

188
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:54,322
I'm impressed you noticed that.

189
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:59,447
Another suspension bridge
just a few steps away.

190
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:01,598
No wonder it's called
the land of suspension bridges.

191
00:11:05,212 --> 00:11:07,014
It's just an ordinary utility pole.

192
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:19,904
"KOYAMA SUSPENSION BRIDGE"
Koyama Suspension Bridge.

193
00:11:23,103 --> 00:11:25,015
This feels even more like
a residential area road

194
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,394
compared to the Ryogoku Suspension Bridge
we just passed.

195
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,812
Yeah.

196
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:33,015
The scenery is really nice.

197
00:11:33,702 --> 00:11:36,296
Must be even more beautiful
during the maple leaf season.

198
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:41,493
Bet this place will be packed
with crowds when that season rolls around.

199
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,197
After all, this area is famous.

200
00:11:43,197 --> 00:11:44,796
That's true.

201
00:11:45,306 --> 00:11:47,080
Better to come
during the quieter off-season

202
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,905
than during the bustling peak season.

203
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:50,905
"COLOUR CORRECTION"
And just adjust the filter

204
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:53,400
with your imagination
to the desired maple leaf colour.

205
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:55,202
That's real convenient.

206
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,004
Are we blocking their path?

207
00:12:11,301 --> 00:12:13,092
They're not people-shy at all.

208
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,416
Are they a parent and child?

209
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:18,619
Looks like this is a wildlife trail too.

210
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:20,301
Looks like it.

"TICKET COUNTER, KAWANE HOT SPRINGS COUPON"
One Okushizu Round-Trip Pass, please.

213
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,207
That will be 4,900 yen.

214
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,004
Is this the train to Senzu?

215
00:12:36,603 --> 00:12:38,504
This train's got a real retro feel to it.

216
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:44,406
Supposedly, you can see Oigawa
on both sides of the windows.

217
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,613
Okay. Let's go with this side then.

218
00:12:47,698 --> 00:12:49,309
The seats are soft.

219
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:55,713
Shaky...

220
00:12:57,905 --> 00:12:59,811
We're doing a suspension bridge tour.

221
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,708
We'll be heading deep into Oigawa.

222
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:04,395
We'll arrive at the campsite
in the evening.

223
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:05,796
Until then, feel free
to wander around on your own.

224
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,806
I'm on the train from Kanaya to Senzu.

225
00:13:10,807 --> 00:13:14,713
Drive safely. Be there before dinner.

226
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:16,208
Got it.

227
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:19,500
They won't be there until evening.

228
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,708
I guess I'll make the most
of my solo trip too.

This parking lot is huge.

233

This suspension bridge
looks like a big one.

234
00:13:48,701 --> 00:13:51,895
Oigawa's suspension bridges
are really sturdy.

235
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,603
They barely shake.

Beats me.

00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:12,296
That grassland is perfect for camping.

00:14:12,296 --> 00:14:13,197

It's huge.

00:14:20,704 --> 00:14:23,106
And it looks new.

"EIGHT BRIDGES SCENIC TRAIL MAP"
After crossing this bridge,

247
00:14:27,501 --> 00:14:29,412
there are many smaller bridges up ahead.

248
00:14:29,413 --> 00:14:30,298
Says here are eight in total.

249
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:34,308
It'll take a while,

250
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:35,407
but should we take a look?

251
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,115
Sure. We're here, after all.

252
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,704
It's not swaying at all.

253
00:14:42,704 --> 00:14:45,091
It's a big bridge after all.

254
00:14:45,794 --> 00:14:48,600
The sides of the bridge
have been made transparent.

255
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,100
Maybe it's an ode
to the suspension bridge it replaced.

MINAMI-ALPS BIOSPHERE RESERVE

Please,
there's nothing romantic about this.

258
00:14:57,787 --> 00:14:59,308
Not at all.

(Note: "not at all" and "eight bridges")

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,611
I… I wasn't trying to make a pun!

FIRST BRIDGE: TOCHINOKI BRIDGE

It's a mini suspension bridge.

SECOND BRIDGE: SAKURA BRIDGE

265
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,209
This part of the bridge is wet.
Be careful. It might be slippery.

266
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:19,907
Maybe it rained yesterday.

FIFTH BRIDGE: KUWANOKI BRIDGE

277
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:49,215
All these bridges are named after trees.

278
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:51,610
Now that you mention it, yeah.

279
00:15:52,304 --> 00:15:56,517
You think they're named after
the trees they're made of?

280
00:15:58,303 --> 00:15:59,210
Not sure about that.

281
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,704
These kind of bridges are usually named
after some myth or legend.

"SIXTH BRIDGE: MIYAZAWA BRIDGE"
Miyazawa…

283
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:08,605
That's not the name of a tree, isn't it?

284
00:16:08,897 --> 00:16:10,194
What on earth is that? That looks insane!

285
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:12,408
Looks like a slide.

286
00:16:12,996 --> 00:16:15,194
What if you slip on this slippery bridge?

287
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:16,803
You'd slide right over to the other end!

288
00:16:17,298 --> 00:16:18,496
Sounds fun.

289
00:16:20,808 --> 00:16:22,511

Wait! If you go that fast…

291
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:24,798
Huh?

292
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,105
These are just ordinary steps.

293
00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:34,110
Aw.

294
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,803
It's just the angle
that makes it look like it's flat.

295
00:16:37,298 --> 00:16:39,206
What a let-down.

296
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,907
There, there…

297
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,422
"SEVENTH BRIDGE: INUKAERI BRIDGE"
I have no idea

298
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:51,790
"SEVENTH BRIDGE: INUKAERI BRIDGE"
what the naming pattern is anymore.

299
00:16:51,793 --> 00:16:53,194
Same.

300
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,509
We finished all of them!

301
00:16:57,511 --> 00:17:00,006
That was a bridge full course.

302
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:03,699
Eight in one go was a tad bit much.

303
00:17:04,292 --> 00:17:04,996
Eh?

304
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,100
Didn't we only pass seven?

305
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:08,209

00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,705
Transfer here.

309
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:23,199
Let's see. It's 10:16 AM.

310
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,801
"DIRECTION, DEPARTURE TIME"
Only three minutes

311
00:17:24,802 --> 00:17:26,402
"DIRECTION, DEPARTURE TIME"
until the train arrives.

312
00:17:27,604 --> 00:17:29,199
Guess I'll take the next train.

313
00:17:29,199 --> 00:17:30,799
I'll hang around until then.

314
00:17:31,706 --> 00:17:35,803
Plus, I only had a sandwich today.
My stomach's growling.

315
00:17:37,701 --> 00:17:41,526
Should I get an ekiben (train bento)
or get some food at a restaurant?

316
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,207
NAKAMARU SENZU EKIMAE NAGASHIMA DAM CURRY

317
00:17:44,698 --> 00:17:45,798
It's dam curry!

318
00:17:47,095 --> 00:17:48,605
This is a special type of curry

319
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:50,704
that can only be found in restaurants
around dam areas,

320
00:17:50,704 --> 00:17:55,407
where white rice is shaped like a dam,
and curry represents the lake.

321
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:58,595
Because the shape of the rice varies
depending on the local dam,

322
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:00,996
dam curry comes in various forms.

323
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:05,209
I've been wanting to try dam curry
for a while now.

324
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,194
Didn't expect to find it here.

325
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:13,001
Oh, that's right.
Oigawa is the largest river in Shizuoka.

326
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:15,912
It's a major river,
so it makes sense that it has a dam.

327
00:18:16,797 --> 00:18:18,506
Therefore, having dam curry here

328
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:20,600
makes perfect sense!

329
00:18:22,704 --> 00:18:23,709
All right.

330
00:18:24,102 --> 00:18:26,006
Let's have some dam curry!

331
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:28,397
And later,
I'll try that Kawane tea soft serve...

332
00:18:28,903 --> 00:18:30,006
Guaranteed satisfaction.

333
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:33,402
...that Rin mentioned!

334
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:35,965
JUMBO BUTAKUSHI (PORK SKEWERS)

335
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,005
SUPER YUMMY EXTRA LARGE BUTAKUSHI

336
00:18:39,793 --> 00:18:41,798
"BUTAKUSHI"
A wild Butakushi has appeared!

337
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:43,792
That'll be 400 yen.

338
00:18:45,294 --> 00:18:47,105
Yum!

339
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:50,907
I was completely lured in
by that delectable aroma.

340
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,671
The aroma of the Butakushi
is deliberately pointed

341
00:18:53,673 --> 00:18:55,511
towards people coming out of Senzu Station.

342
00:18:56,102 --> 00:18:58,511
There's absolutely no escaping it.

343
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:03,007
That Jumbo Butakushi was delicious.

344
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,803
But that's far from enough.

345
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:11,501
I'm still not full yet.

346
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:20,808
Next up is the main course, dam curry.

347
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:21,902
Let's dig in!

348
00:19:22,693 --> 00:19:24,506
Senzu's dam curry is modelled after

349
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:28,001
the upstream Nagashima Dam.

350
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,258
The fried shrimp represents
the suspension bridges

351
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,907
spanning both sides of the dam,

352
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:33,004
while the boiled egg on the curry

353
00:19:33,004 --> 00:19:36,511
symbolises the Okuoikojo Station.

354
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:40,605
Rin and Aya are planning
to ride all the way deep into Oigawa.

355
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,897
I'll just get off at Okuoikojo Station.

356
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:46,198
But the fun of dam curry
doesn't stop there.

357
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:49,104
After admiring the presentation
and tasting the flavours...

358
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:50,502
Open the gate!

359
00:19:50,502 --> 00:19:53,710
One can even simulate
the release of water from the dam.

360
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:58,402
A dish with a playful touch is superb!

361
00:19:58,403 --> 00:20:00,199
Fun to play and delicious to eat!

362
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,507
I must learn well.

363
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:05,101
Dam curry is truly delicious!

364
00:20:05,798 --> 00:20:07,252
"KAWANE TEA SOFT SERVE"
And finally…

365
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,913
Kawane tea soft serve for dessert!

366
00:20:09,913 --> 00:20:11,403
Thank you for the food!

367
00:20:13,601 --> 00:20:17,611
The aroma and bitterness of Kawane tea
instantly fill in my mouth.

368
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:21,413
The sweetness is just right.
It tastes so refreshing.

369
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:23,512
So good!

370
00:20:25,398 --> 00:20:26,700
Oh, it's already so late.

371
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:30,611
The train has arrived.

372
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:33,002
So, this is what I'll be riding.

373
00:20:33,794 --> 00:20:36,002
It's so tiny and cute.

374
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,793
But that also means
the interior is small and narrow.

375
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:41,705
I'll sit here.

376
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,408
The conductor said this side
offers a better view.

377
00:20:47,002 --> 00:20:49,497
We apologise for the wait.

378
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:52,804
The train bound for Ikawa
is about to depart.

379
00:20:52,804 --> 00:20:54,101
Wait!

380
00:20:55,107 --> 00:20:56,908
We just barely made it!

381
00:20:58,393 --> 00:21:01,398
You took too long choosing an ekiben.

382
00:21:01,806 --> 00:21:04,205
There were just too many options...

383
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:05,611
Hello.

384
00:21:06,101 --> 00:21:07,002
Hello.

385
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:12,002
And we're off.

386
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:17,809
Thank you for choosing this train.

387
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,799
This train is bound for Ikawa.

388
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:22,981
KAWABE FOODS

389
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:36,398
NEXT EPISODE:
JOURNEY TO HATANAGI AND THE ROAD TO HELL

390
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:37,102
