<i>Neighboring residents, please follow</i>

8
00:00:25,276 --> 00:00:27,778
-<i>I repeat. Neighboring residents…</i>
-Why Sagamihara?

9
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:29,572
When's the JGSDF coming?

10
00:00:29,655 --> 00:00:31,574
Mommy, I want to pee.

11
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:35,578
Don't panic, please.
The next vehicle is coming right away.

12
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:39,290
Please remain calm.
There will be enough buses.

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,292
How's it going with Self Defense?

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,377
{\an8}<i>We're setting up a SDF Artillery</i>

<i>in the Reon Mall parking lot.</i>

16
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:49,091
-FO is ready.
-The observation area is set.

17
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:50,760
What's the information on evacuation?

18
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,636
How's the Honju?

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,974
After appearing at the Kannawa Fault,
it's been growing and moving underground.

20
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,228
<i>We suspect it appeared on the surface</i>
<i>due to entering its breeding phase.</i>

21
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:05,399
A large number of yoju
have appeared along with the honju.

22
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,694
Hey, just how many are there?

23
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,363
Fortunately, the neutralization area
isn't far.

24
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:13,866
Considering damages to the area,

25
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:17,078
Area Bravo is best suited

26
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,080
for the destruction of the honju.

27
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,166
I'll take care of the honju.

28
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,585
The shooting position will be Area Echo.

29
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:28,631
That way, we can target the enemy
along the Tokyo loop line.

30
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:33,219
This strategy will be named
the Sagamihara Neutralization Operation.

31
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,513
Good luck, everyone.

<i>But don't let me down,</i>

00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,633
<i>Kafka Hibino.</i>

40
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,310
Vice Captain! Senpai's about to throw up!

41
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:26,313
I'm sorry. I ate too much from nerves.

42
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:29,525
-Most people can't eat from nerves!
-Open the windows!

43
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:31,026
I'll kill you if you barf!

44
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,946
-What's wrong with you?
-Please, spare my life!

<i>And that is</i>

53
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,775
{\an8}<i>the honju we're dealing with.</i>

54
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,040
Here's the strategy.

55
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,502
The honju will be dealt with
by Captain Ashiro's platoon.

56
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:57,214
The problem is the yoju, which keeps
being produced in large numbers.

57
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,134
This neutralization area doesn't have

58
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,637
the necessary facilities or major
transportation for neutralization.

59
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,597
{\an8}Your job

60
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:09,018
{\an8}is to get rid of all the yoju in this area
without letting them escape.

61
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,272
It's an important task that greatly
influences the damages

62
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:16,442
and the time and cost
of reconstruction if it fails.

63
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,696
Of course, the platoon, including newbies,
will be placed at the very back.

64
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,197
In other words,

65
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:26,452
you're our last resort.

66
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:31,248
Any questions?

67
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:40,132
All right.

68
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,887
No matter how high you score
during training,

69
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,847
it doesn't save a single life.

70
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:52,186
Show us your strength on the field,
baby chicks.

71
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,358
All right, let's go!

72
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,035
I'm counting on you.

73
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,205
This is the SDF Artillery
Regiment Command Post.

74
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,500
We've evacuated all residents
and set up an observation area.

75
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,211
Roger that. We thank you for your help.

76
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,215
All platoons and the SDF
have completed preparation.

77
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,551
Three minutes
until Captain Ashiro is ready.

78
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,054
<i>It's finally time, Senpai.</i>

79
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:31,266
Yeah. I have to do good work here or else…

80
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,686
Keep this up, and you'll
never get promoted as an officer.

81
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,814
You'll be fired in three months!

82
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:38,941
I have no future here.

83
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,985
Nerves, panic.

84
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,072
All kinds of pressure are on us.

85
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,450
So, why is it

86
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,287
that I'm so excited right now?

87
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:58,418
<i>It makes sense. It's the job</i>
<i>he's wanted to do for so long.</i>

88
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,547
-<i>Senpai.</i>
-Yeah?

89
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,551
Let's make sure our first mission
is a success!

90
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:07,928
Yeah.

91
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,514
<i>Confirmed yoju invasion in Area Echo!</i>

92
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:12,391
<i>They're here!</i>

93
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,229
Let's go, Kikoru.

94
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:22,276
Why are you ordering me around?

95
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,154
-Don't die, Ichikawa!
<i>-You too, Senpai!</i>

96
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:32,411
All right! Let's succeed
at our first mission!

97
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,871
Let's go!

98
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,975
Captain Ashiro is now ready
at the shooting point.

99
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,688
Please continue to lure the honju
to Area Bravo and provide fire support.

100
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:03,484
<i>Roger that. This is the SDF Artillery</i>

Knock our socks off, everyone.

104

<i>It's begun.</i>

105
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,694
<i>But it's not like the exams at all.</i>

106
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:51,448
<i>I feel oddly calm.</i>

107
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:56,328
<i>I can feel the suit working with me.</i>

108
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,751
<i>Release full combat power!</i>

109
00:09:07,548 --> 00:09:08,840
Don't go to the front!

110
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:11,468
You're a one-percenter,
so, stay back, all right?

111
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:13,428
Geez.

112
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:16,181
Why do we have to babysit
the newbie officers?

113
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:20,018
Just watch where you won't
get in the way, okay?

114
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:23,981
Listen up. We still don't know
the enemy's weak spot.

115
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,776
Be careful until we get information
from the frontlines.

116
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,154
Yes, sir.

117
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,950
We'll be careful and blow away all areas
that look like weak spots.

118
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,505
<i>What the hell?!</i>

119
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:51,008
<i>That's not the power of someone</i>
<i>who joined a month ago.</i>

120
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:55,596
<i>So, that's Kikoru Shinomiya, huh?</i>

121
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,389
Kikoru!

122
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,683
Nice job!

123
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,729
Of course I did a nice job! It's me!

124
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,066
<i>Irregular vitals.</i>
<i>Sudden increase in heart rate.</i>

125
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,694
Don't make such unnecessary reports!

127
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:21,163

00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,759
Great job, Furuhashi!

129
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,011
All right! You see that, Reno?

130
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:46,063
Did you do that without an assist?

131
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:48,774
Yes.

132
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,945
I changed the bullet from burst rounds
to freeze rounds.

133
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:58,700
This works better for me.
I can slow down the enemy and fight.

134
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:02,788
If I get used to this,
I can hunt better than this!

135
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,711
<i>Not yet. I have to be stronger,</i>

136
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,963
<i>so Senpai doesn't have to transform.</i>

What's going on with this year's newbies?

Platoon Leader Nakanoshima!
What's with them?

141
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,622
I'm losing my confidence!

142
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,752
I knew we had some good people
this year, but I didn't expect this.

143
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,130
I've already killed six.

144
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,549
You're a bit slow, Haruichi.

145
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,800
Okay, okay.

146
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:01,054
Don't forget that four of those
were assisted by me.

147
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,308
<i>One's a wild type,</i>
<i>one's a cool, nice guy type.</i>

149
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,938
-Yup, we sure got some good ones!
-You mean their looks?

150
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,901
I heard there were a few exceptional ones
from Vice Captain Hoshino,

151
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,570
but that's not all.

152
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:21,116
The average unleashed combat power
is high among the newbies.

153
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,537
The high-achievers
are making everyone level up.

00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,904
<i>Listen up. We still don't know</i>

Senpai, look there!

167
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:17,547
What the hell is he doing?

168
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:23,970
<i>It's easy to take apart</i>
<i>with the suit, even at 1%.</i>

169
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,098
<i>Could they distribute these</i>
<i>to cleanup sites</i>

170
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,352
<i>once they're easier to mass produce?</i>

171
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,149
<i>It's a common fungal-type kaiju structure.</i>

172
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,861
<i>But its core isn't where it usually is.</i>

173
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:43,406
<i>Where is it? If not here, is it here?</i>

174
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,410
<i>What? Is this…?</i>

175
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:52,874
<i>-Vice Captain Hoshino! I found the core!</i>
-What?

176
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,085
It's at the base of the neck.

177
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:59,381
But it's located under a hard muscle fiber
that acts as the spine.

178
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:03,718
So, officers with low attacking power
might have to shoot from the side.

179
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,095
I see.

180
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,181
<i>And another thing. This is more important.</i>

181
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,226
The yoju have reproductive organs, too.

182
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,647
It's the white, bumpy organ at the butt.

183
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:21,111
If we don't destroy these, more yoju
might be born from the dead bodies.

184
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,573
Kafka. Great work.

185
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:30,120
<i>Okonogi-chan. Please share</i>
<i>that information with all officers.</i>

186
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:34,416
Roger! I'll share the data about
the yoju's core and reproductive organs.

187
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,752
<i>Your previous job experience helped,</i>

188
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:40,005
<i>but it's because you studied hard</i>
<i>every day.</i>

189
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,965
<i>Well done.</i>

190
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,595
<i>I was useful for the Defense Force?</i>

191
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:52,434
I'm going to disable
all the dead bodies one by one.

192
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,103
<i>I'll do anything I can do.</i>

193
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:56,855
<i>Until I reach</i>

194
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,442
<i>the position next to Mina…</i>

195
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,823
-What is it?
<i>-They've started.</i>

196
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,327
<i>Honju has reached</i>
<i>the predicted enemy engagement area.</i>

197
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,455
<i>Requesting the SDF to withdraw.</i>

198
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:17,250
<i>The Defense Force has begun attacking</i>
<i>on the leg of the honju.</i>

199
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,671
<i>Please demobilize the honju</i>
<i>as much as possible.</i>

200
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:34,809
Target captured. Coriolis has completed
gravity effect corrections.

201
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:37,270
No shooting attack target in the area.

202
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:39,439
First bullet is locked and loaded.

203
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:42,943
<i>Roger. All clear on shooting conditions.</i>

204
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,653
<i>Begin shooting now.</i>

205
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,156
Let's bet on who becomes
the coolest Defense Force officer!

206
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,868
Kafka-kun.

207
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,163
This is who I am now.

208
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:12,889
<i>Unleashed combat power, 96%.</i>

209
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,393
Watch carefully, Kafka.

210
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:32,242
<i>This is…</i>

211
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,496
<i>the power of the person</i>
<i>you're working to stand next to.</i>

212
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:43,253
-Second bullet is locked and loaded.
-<i>Roger. Begin shooting.</i>

213
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:55,640
<i>Honju's vital responses have disappeared.</i>
<i>It's collapsing!</i>

214
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:10,572
-Third bullet is locked and loaded.
-<i>Roger. Begin shooting.</i>

215
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,832
Honju has been destroyed!
All movements have stopped.

216
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,335
As expected of Captain.

217
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,881
<i>Fourth bullet is locked and loaded.</i>

218
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:33,053
<i>-But the honju has already been silenced…</i>
-Please provide the command.

219
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,013
<i>Roger!</i>

220
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:42,645
<i>Damn. It's different from seeing it</i>
<i>on TV or through binoculars.</i>

221
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,440
<i>She's tremendously strong!</i>

222
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,026
You ready to give up now?

223
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,157
To stand next to her means

224
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,035
you have to have that much power.

225
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:01,289
You say that, but can you do
what she did, Vice Captain Hoshino?

226
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,335
-No way.
-"No way"?

227
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,047
I have a low unleashed combat power
for shooting weapons,

228
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,092
so, I can't beat Captain Ashiro
when dealing with the big ones.

229
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,553
But with the small and mid-sized kaiju…

230
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,389
Vice Captain, behind you!

231
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,481
I'm better at these than her.

232
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:29,859
A sword?

233
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,612
<i>He was so fast, I couldn't</i>
<i>see his movements.</i>

234
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,951
I come from a long line of kaiju
neutralizers since the Muromachi era.

235
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,078
I'm better at this stuff.

236
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:46,376
Captains and Vice Captains
are the strongest in the division.

237
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,046
They provide unique equipment
to suit your fighting style.

238
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,345
<i>-Hoshina. I'm done with the honju.</i>
-Roger.

239
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,723
We're done talking here.
The real fight's about to begin.

240
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,893
But they defeated the honju.

241
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:09,274
<i>I told you. The problem</i>
<i>is the large number of yoju being born.</i>

242
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:13,695
<i>Even with the honju's dead,</i>
<i>the remaining yoju left in its dead body…</i>

243
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,906
Just as expected.

244
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,159
<i>They're coming.</i>

245
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,830
<i>…will flood out at the end.</i>

246
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:38,219
All right, everyone.
This is the big finale.

247
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,807
Once we kick those away, let's go home
and have a good breakfast.

248
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:46,728
Kick them away? He makes it sound so easy!

249
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,483
You're already beat, newbies?
Your stamina isn't quite there yet.

250
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:57,322
You bastards! Show them
that fighting isn't just about

251
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:58,615
unleashed combat power!

252
00:19:58,698 --> 00:19:59,574
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

253
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:03,453
-Hey, you two.
-Platoon Leader Nakanoshima.

254
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:05,747
You could leave everything to your senpai

255
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,209
and take a break. What do you want to do?

256
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:13,421
-We're going, of course!
-We're going, of course!

257
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,508
OPERATION MEMBER OFFICERS
ACTIVITY INFORMATION

258
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,969
The newbies are getting tired.

259
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,514
Both their activity levels
and combat powers are going down.

260
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:27,393
It's a pretty laborious neutralization
for a first mission.

261
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:30,313
But once they get through this,

262
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,898
they might grow even more.

263
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:38,071
Most officers' unleashed combat power
stops at 20% to 30%.

264
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,949
They remain at the officer level
until retirement.

265
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:46,704
But there are a few talents that get over
that barrier and become captain level.

266
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:51,209
This year, only Kikoru Shinomiya
got over that barrier.

267
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,211
But I see that potential

268
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,677
in Reno Ichikawa, as well.

269
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,182
<i>Shit, I trained hard for five years</i>

270
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,226
<i>at technical college!</i>

271
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,604
<i>Why can't I keep up with him?</i>

272
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:16,859
Iharu-kun. Looks like
there are no more yoju here.

273
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,320
Yeah, looks like it.

274
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,615
<i>Confirmed yoju invasion at Area Foxtrot.</i>

275
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:26,536
-They're here! Let's go back!
-Yeah.

276
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,258
{\an8}<i>Monster Sweeper?</i>

277
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,760
<i>Why is there a cleaner here?</i>

278
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:46,222
Hey, you didn't hear the alert?

279
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,266
Cleanup will be done later.

280
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:52,395
Him, too.

281
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,773
The reproductive organ I placed
has been destroyed.

282
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,818
How did they find out?

283
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:03,364
Is there an officer
with extensive kaiju knowledge?

284
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,870
You know anything about it?

285
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,919
