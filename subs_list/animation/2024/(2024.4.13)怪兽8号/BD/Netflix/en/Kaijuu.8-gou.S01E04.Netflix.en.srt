00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:08,092
ORIGINAL WORK BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

2
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,469
<i>I'll never give up this time!</i>

3
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,224
{\an8}<i>Ow, ouch…</i>

4
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,975
{\an8}<i>Are you all right, senpai?</i>

5
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:46,065
See? I can still stand up!

6
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,235
He stood up using his broken leg!

7
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,779
Well, if he insists.

8
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,824
<i>If you're in real trouble,</i>
<i>I'm going to release the remote shield.</i>

9
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:57,952
Bring it on!

10
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:05,292
Ichikawa. Don't mind me.
Just keep pushing.

11
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,963
We promised that whatever happens to me,
you would…

12
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:13,008
I'll support you. As much as possible.
Let's go!

13
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:20,432
Ichikawa…

14
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,104
<i>Right. That's the kind of guy you are.</i>

15
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,857
If you say so!

16
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,486
Are they serious?

17
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,366
Let's go, Ichikawa!

18
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,661
It's the unification plan!

19
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,205
Everyone's looking at us! So embarrassing!

20
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,332
I leave the mobility powers to you.

21
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:48,586
Use the power from your suit
as much as possible!

22
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:52,298
My broken leg hurts like hell, but…

23
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:55,217
Please use all your knowledge to attack!

24
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,468
Yeah!

25
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,389
Let's let them in!

26
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:02,641
-They'll be the official comedians!
-Be serious!

27
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:06,729
Chase after Kikoru, and don't mind me!
Quickly!

28
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,272
Got it!

29
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,649
Don't fall, all right?

30
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,111
<i>So fast!</i>

31
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:21,952
-I'll beat you all!
-See ya.

32
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,293
Be prepared to support them
as soon as we arrive!

33
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,128
Leave it to me!

34
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:49,021
She won't even let us help, huh?

35
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,913
Number 2016

36
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,791
has blown away
the last yoju in Area Delta,

37
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,126
now engaging with the honju.

38
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,565
<i>The last one…</i>

39
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,840
Honju has been defeated.

40
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,218
<i>Final round is now complete!</i>

41
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:05,180
<i>We'll be collecting the drones.</i>
<i>Good work, all of you.</i>

42
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,642
Seriously?

43
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:12,521
That was too fast, that bastard!

44
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,111
{\an8}UNIFICATION RELEASED

45
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,575
We're collecting the drones
and taking in the injured applicants,

46
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,661
right, Vice-Captain Hoshino?

47
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,872
Huh? Yeah, right.

48
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,791
<i>That was way too quick.</i>

49
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,419
<i>It took so long to get ready.</i>

50
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,298
Kikoru Shinomiya.
She's beyond her reputation.

51
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,301
<i>Even she's interested in her, huh?</i>

52
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:46,472
We were expecting about 30 people
to retire, but it's zero.

53
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,265
We have very few injuries.

54
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:53,228
This must be because Shinomiya
was on the ground.

55
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,940
As expected of Director General
Shinomiya's daughter.

56
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:59,735
She'll be the future pillar
of the Defense Force for sure.

57
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,404
<i>She's the light of hope for our country.</i>

58
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,667
<i>I was perfect,</i>

59
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,628
<i>right, Dad?</i>

60
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,424
All right.

61
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:26,136
I'll go see Kafka Hibino lose
for the fourth time.

62
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:41,318
Kikoru Shinomiya's powers were superhuman,

63
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,445
just like they all said.

64
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,283
Yeah. She kept crushing me good
the whole day.

65
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:52,121
But thanks to her, I was able
to fight until the last moment.

66
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,124
-Now, we'll just wait for the results.
-That's true.

67
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,792
What is that?

68
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,588
What's going on?

69
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,298
Senpai, let's evacuate for now.

70
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,978
<i>I was able to protect my heart</i>
<i>by concentrating the shield in one area.</i>

71
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,689
<i>I can still fight.</i>

72
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:25,779
What are you?

73
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,782
She's still moving?

74
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,535
<i>He can speak?</i>

75
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,376
What is that skin?

76
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,421
All right, now.

77
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,465
-I'll leave it to you.
<i>-An intelligent kaiju?</i>

78
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,883
<i>What's going on?</i>

79
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:46,967
You!

80
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,220
Don't forget to chew before swallowing.

81
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:57,478
Emergency!

82
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,772
Number 2016 has abnormal vitals!

83
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,150
What the hell is going on?

84
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:05,152
I don't know. But…

85
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:09,948
the dead kaiju are reacting.
They're coming back to life.

86
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:15,245
What? Those kaiju
don't have that kind of power.

87
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,041
Estimated fortitude measurement
for the honju is complete! It's 6.4!

88
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,587
<i>Its strength went up? That's the level</i>
<i>that requires a whole company.</i>

89
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:27,132
<i>If anyone here can take it down</i>
<i>by themselves…</i>

90
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,718
Release remote shields for all applicants.

91
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,636
Yes, ma'am!

92
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,305
Return the drones on the ground
and display what's going on.

93
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,890
Hoshina. Let's go.

94
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,392
<i>…it would be her or me.</i>

95
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,061
Roger.

96
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:43,357
<i>Emergency, emergency.</i>

97
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,693
<i>All applicants, evacuate immediately</i>
<i>to your closest shelter.</i>

98
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,112
<i>I repeat. All applicants,</i>
<i>evacuate immediately</i>

99
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,156
<i>to your closest shelter.</i>

100
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:58,539
<i>Evacuate? But if we evacuate, this thing…</i>

101
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,042
<i>Someone has to stop him</i>

102
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,045
<i>or so many people would die!</i>

103
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,215
<i>Use the kaiju muscle to stop the bleeding.</i>

104
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,427
<i>I can still move. I can still fight.</i>

105
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:17,057
<i>I'll never allow victims,</i>
<i>not while I'm on this ground!</i>

106
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,978
<i>Be perfect, for the future</i>
<i>of this country.</i>

107
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:25,148
I have to be perfect!

108
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:41,164
<i>I won't lose.</i>

109
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,667
<i>Wow, Kikoru-chan!</i>

110
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,918
KIKORU SHINOMIYA
KAGARI TOJO

111
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:48,922
Your name's at the very top!
It means you were first, right?

112
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,759
Exactly! It means I got accepted
with the highest score!

113
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:54,553
Wow!

114
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,930
-Lisa.
-Dad!

115
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,141
Lisa, congratulations on your acceptance.

116
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,477
Don't pet me like that! It's embarrassing.

117
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:07,274
-I'll buy you a treat, like you promised.
-Really? Yay!

118
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,775
See you, Kikoru-chan!

119
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,778
Let's go eat barbecue to celebrate!

120
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:16,033
I told you we didn't need to worry.
As expected of my son!

121
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,494
Kikoru-sama.

122
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:23,582
Master will be coming home today.

123
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,377
I'm sure he'll be extremely proud.

124
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,421
Yeah!

125
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:37,304
You got accepted at the top of class?
That's to be expected.

126
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,808
If you focus too much on one success,
you'll end up tripping.

127
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,437
Focus on your next goal.

128
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,523
Kikoru.

129
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:55,322
Be perfect, for the future
of this country.

130
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,408
For your dead mother as well.

131
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,204
Yes, sir.

132
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,250
<i>I won't lose!</i>

133
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,086
<i>Don't stop moving forward.</i>

134
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,712
<i>I can keep fighting.</i>

135
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,672
<i>You must be second to none.</i>

136
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,512
<i>As long as one arm can move…</i>

137
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,057
<i>You must be formidable.</i>

138
00:11:22,974 --> 00:11:24,810
<i>…I can still keep fighting!</i>

139
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,815
<i>No…</i>

140
00:11:40,659 --> 00:11:44,079
I've found the honju!
Kikoru Shinomiya is injured nearby.

141
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,792
<i>The attacking uniorgan that we removed</i>
<i>from the honju has regrown.</i>

142
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,294
{\an8}<i>Its energy is being compressed!</i>

143
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,964
<i>Shit. Will we make it?</i>

144
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,471
<i>I can't.</i>

145
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,607
I'm sorry, Dad.

146
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:20,115
I couldn't be perfect.

147
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,617
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,000
You did well, Kikoru!

149
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:34,045
Why are you here?

150
00:12:47,309 --> 00:12:49,394
Because you fought so hard,

151
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,855
everyone was able to evacuate.

152
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,860
Now, leave it to me.

153
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,411
What was that explosion?

154
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,370
Shit!

155
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,372
Come on. Keep up!

156
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:11,750
Run to the shelter, quickly!

157
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,462
A signal flare?

158
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,881
-You can run over there, right?
-Yeah.

159
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:22,135
Leading the evacuation, huh?

160
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,846
As expected of the JGSDF hopeful.

161
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,558
<i>Kafka senpai.</i>

162
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,022
Senpai, let's evacuate for now.

163
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,649
The honju came back to life!

164
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,652
Don't run there. Shinomiya's
fighting it right now.

165
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,988
I alerted headquarters. Everyone, run.
Those are orders.

166
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,324
You heard him, senpai.

167
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,619
He's already gone!

168
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:51,873
<i>He couldn't have transformed, could he?</i>

169
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,625
<i>Could he?</i>

170
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:58,296
<i>If he transforms in this state,</i>
<i>he'd be killed for sure.</i>

171
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:01,550
<i>No. He'd do it.</i>

172
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,135
<i>He's the type of guy to do it</i>
<i>without pause.</i>

173
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,639
What is that?

174
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,267
What's going on?

175
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:12,060
You're…

176
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,271
a kaiju?

177
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,315
Kikoru.

178
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,526
Please, please!

179
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,655
Don't tell anyone at the Defense Force
about this, please!

180
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:24,656
Please!

181
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,126
I'll fill you in on the details later.

182
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,130
I'll crush him in seconds,
so, relax and rest up.

183
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:45,594
A mysterious high-energy source
has appeared near the honju.

184
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,345
It could be a new type of kaiju.

185
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,723
-A new type?
-You have any footage?

186
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,852
The visibility is bad due
to network obstruction from the explosion.

187
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,938
What are these numbers?

188
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,858
Fortitude 9.8?

189
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:03,612
<i>No way. The explosion must have</i>
<i>messed with the measuring tool.</i>

190
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,071
That must be it.

191
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:10,368
It has to be. Otherwise, it would be
a huge, history-changing kaiju!

192
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,714
Sorry. I don't have time right now.

193
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,549
I'll clean you up…

194
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,722
in one blow!

195
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,176
Let's see if you can resurrect this time!

196
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,220
Huh?

197
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:15,934
What!? No way! Please don't resurrect!

198
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,024
Don't scare me like that!

199
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,610
What's with this guy?

200
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:32,617
<i>Yoju?</i>

201
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:36,454
Looks like you'll be all right.

202
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,085
I'm glad you're okay!

203
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,216
Wait. But let me say this one thing.

204
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:51,094
You really should watch out for yourself
a little more!

205
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,763
That's my line to you!

206
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,391
Hey, Ichikawa! Why are you here?

207
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,226
You ran out without talking to me

208
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,478
and you transformed
and caused a big scene!

209
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:04,524
I thought I could get by with just
transforming a part of my body,

210
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,609
but once I saw the real thing,
I couldn't do it.

211
00:17:06,693 --> 00:17:08,903
Just be more careful--

212
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,490
Shinomiya!

213
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,414
Ashiro and Hoshina has arrived
on the scene.

214
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:25,170
What's going on here?
How do you leave behind a scene like this?

215
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,965
This reminds me

216
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:30,884
of something I've seen.

217
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,846
Captain Ashiro, we didn't find
any more applicants.

218
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,931
This is the operation room.

219
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,894
They took in three new applicants
at Shelter Six.

220
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,897
Kikoru Shinomiya, Reno Ichikawa,

221
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,732
and Kafka Hibino. Three in total.

222
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,650
So, they were all right.

223
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,654
Now, all applicants have been taken in.

224
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:52,614
<i>Roger.</i>

225
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:59,245
Kikoru Shinomiya is strong,
but this scene is strange.

226
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,415
The resurrection of the kaiju,

227
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,211
this explosion site…
There are a lot of mysteries.

228
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:10,173
Send out investigation and disposal teams.

229
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,842
Hoshina and I'll take care of the yoju.

230
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,594
Roger!

231
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,849
<i>It's similar to that scene</i>
<i>three months ago.</i>

232
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,852
<i>Could they be related?</i>

233
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,941
I'm glad your injuries
weren't as serious as we thought.

234
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,609
Hospitalized again?

235
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,904
Shinomiya's injuries
aren't life-threatening either.

236
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:36,116
They're using all the Defense Force's
scientific abilities to treat her.

237
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,661
Why is she getting special treatment?
I want that, too!

238
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,123
You only have some broken bones.

239
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:46,251
It all ended in a blink of an eye.

240
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:51,172
Battling with those super talented guys
brought it all back.

241
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,551
Chasing dreams

242
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,470
is a priceless and precious thing.

243
00:18:57,554 --> 00:19:02,100
It means losing to someone
every minute and second.

244
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,685
Senpai.

245
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,564
But it gets you fired up so much

246
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,190
that those things don't matter!

247
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,526
I remember that now.

248
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:15,738
It's all because you pushed me
to keep going. Thanks, Ichikawa.

249
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,494
Captain Ashiro!

250
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,746
Why are you here, Captain?

251
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:27,417
I heard you two carried Shinomiya here.

252
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,337
I thank you for your rescue.

253
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,007
Sorry to interrupt.

254
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,092
Mi…

255
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,386
<i>No, now's not the time.</i>

256
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:43,516
<i>I'll talk to her once I'm an officer.</i>

257
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:48,771
<i>Just watch me,</i>

258
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:50,899
<i>Mina!</i>

259
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,785
Dad. Was I perfect?

260
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,165
I…

261
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,127
Dad?

262
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,715
It's fine, stay put.

263
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,801
Vice Captain Hoshina.

264
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,180
We took care of all the resurrected kaiju.

265
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:24,807
And luckily, there were no victims.

266
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,685
It's thanks to you,
for cleaning up the honju.

267
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,024
Am I wrong?

268
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,281
I'm glad you're okay!

269
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,411
No. I was the one

270
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,580
that defeated that kaiju.

271
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,585
{\an8}KOKUBUNJI, TOKYO

272
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,212
{\an8}<i>Next up is the mysterious incident</i>

273
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:58,299
<i>of the resurrecting kaiju</i>
<i>at the Defense Force examination hall.</i>

274
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,593
<i>Though there were few injuries,</i>

275
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,679
<i>there were zero fatalities.</i>

276
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,806
-<i>The kaiju that came back to life…</i>
-Zero?

277
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,391
Zero?

278
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,769
No way. Zero fatalities
in a situation like that?

279
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,730
Is this "captain" person that strong?

280
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,817
<i>The search for Kaiju No. 8 is ongoing,</i>

281
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,945
-<i>and the Neutralization Bureau is…</i>
-No. 8? What's that?

282
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:25,034
This is how you pick up a phone, right?

283
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,870
<i>Hey, where did you go off to?</i>

284
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,914
<i>Break time is over!</i>

285
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:33,042
-Oh…
-<i>Don't "oh" me! Come on, dude!</i>

286
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:36,045
Yes, I'll be back right away.

287
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,802
Humans are so annoying about time, huh?

288
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:49,058
Hey, I'm so sorry. I had an upset stomach.

289
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,686
We were worried about you!

290
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,523
Let us know before camping out
in the bathroom, okay?

291
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,609
Sorry, Toku-san.

292
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:01,779
Apparently, there was an accident
at the examination hall.

293
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:02,989
Seriously?

294
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:06,617
Are Kafka and Ichikawa okay?

295
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,911
Oops. Got to be careful.

296
