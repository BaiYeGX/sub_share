1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,130
Target found.

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:09,927
You'll be my prey.

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,559
<i>He's strong.</i>

4
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,727
<i>Not only that.</i>

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,439
<i>He's… enjoying the fight.</i>

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,444
Clashing face-to-face
with an equal opponent!

7
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:28,904
Equal!

8
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,199
Equal!

9
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,996
Your core's smaller than expected.

10
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,710
He did it!

11
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,962
As expected of Vice-Captain!

12
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:51,010
He grew in size?

13
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:54,096
<i>A release of heat</i>
<i>and an increase in fortitude!</i>

14
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,848
<i>This is…</i>

15
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,350
<i>Fortitude…</i>

16
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:01,353
<i>9.0!</i>

17
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:18,079
ORIGINAL WORK BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

18
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,546
He's huge.

19
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,214
This isn't an opponent

20
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,384
that Vice-Captain can handle on his own.

21
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,521
<i>Vice-Captain!</i>

22
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:09,899
Hibino-san?

23
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:22,912
Technique Number Three…

24
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:24,997
Return Slasher!

25
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,970
Stop moving around!

26
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,900
Amazing. He's adjusted his moves
for a bigger opponent. But…

27
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,820
<i>The blade won't go through.</i>
<i>This is why I hate Giant Classes.</i>

28
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,159
<i>Tire him out and hit the core</i>
<i>in the back with one go.</i>

29
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,245
<i>That's my only option!</i>

30
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,333
<i>You've reached the drive limit.</i>

31
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,877
-<i>Disable Maximum Release now.</i>
-<i>An overheat?</i>

32
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:14,755
Over ten minutes have passed
on Maximum Release!

33
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,048
It's dangerous to continue!

34
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,180
I have a minute, max.

35
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:33,524
Self-destruction?

36
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,656
<i>What a heartless, cold-blooded move,</i>
<i>as expected from a kaiju.</i>

37
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,534
<i>He's like a living missile.</i>

38
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,995
<i>But it was a good smoke screen.</i>

39
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,295
Number Six!

40
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:11,770
<i>Drive limit reached.</i>
<i>Maximum Release has been disabled.</i>

41
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:15,524
<i>The wearer must attempt</i>
<i>medical treatment right away.</i>

42
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:18,569
Vice-Captain.

43
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,072
<i>Vice-Captain!</i>

44
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:33,584
If this were the Edo Era, you would have
been worshiped as a prodigy.

45
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,588
But we no longer live
in the time of swords.

46
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,717
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Soshiro?

47
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,095
Give up on joining the Defense Force.

48
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,854
<i>Vice-Captain! Vice-Captain!</i>

49
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,230
Vice-Captain!

50
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:59,735
It's all good. I'm alive.

51
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,447
<i>Ouch.</i>

52
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,409
<i>I put up the full shield.</i>
<i>That kaiju's no joke.</i>

53
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,545
<i>The Maximum Release got disabled.</i>

54
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:20,547
<i>What should I do now?</i>

55
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,509
<i>What can I do?</i>

56
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:28,472
How's it looking outside?

57
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,392
<i>We've almost completed evacuating</i>
<i>all residents.</i>

58
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:35,854
<i>We're doing much better</i>
<i>fighting the yoju as well.</i>

59
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:45,948
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

60
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:47,741
That means…

61
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,161
I have to carry out my duties
until the very end.

62
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,413
<i>You're in no condition to fight.</i>

63
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,753
Hoshina-Style Sword-Slay
Technique Number One - Air Slicer!

64
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:14,601
I've figured you out already.
You cannot defeat me with that weapon.

65
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:17,980
<i>Shut the hell up!</i>

66
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,982
<i>I've known that for a long time!</i>

67
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,904
<i>Give up, Soshiro.</i>

68
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,700
You have a low unleashed combat power
for firearms.

69
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,704
That won't be enough to fight nowadays.

70
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,457
Give up, Hoshina-kun.

71
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:41,503
Kaiju are getting larger nowadays.

72
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:45,466
If the sword is your only weapon,
you'll lose your life one day.

73
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:51,054
Everyone's told me the same thing
since I was a kid!

74
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,185
<i>But she said to me…</i>

75
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,562
Soshiro Hoshina.

76
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,190
I hear you're our swords specialist.

77
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,358
Yes, I am.

78
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:08,280
<i>So I'm going to be told to give up again?</i>

79
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,699
I need your skills.

80
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,953
Will you join my division, Hoshina?

81
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,247
It's possible

82
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,334
that we'll be facing strong
Miniature Class opponents in the future.

83
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,255
I'm the opposite of you.
I'm no good with blades.

84
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:27,966
I even avoid holding kitchen knives
if possible.

85
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,768
When I pierce through the enemy,

86
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,230
will you cut open the path for me?

87
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:48,862
<i>She entrusted me with the base</i>
<i>while she's gone.</i>

88
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:51,949
<i>I'll protect it with my life!</i>

89
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,913
Number Two, Cross Slasher!

90
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,377
Number Three, Return Slasher!

91
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,133
Number Four, Wild Slasher!

92
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,681
Number Five, Mist Slasher!

93
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:18,934
Number Six!

94
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:26,858
Vice-Captain!

95
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,956
I have to do it!

96
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,208
Could he be…!

97
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,671
<i>If he transforms here, he won't</i>
<i>get away with it this time!</i>

98
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,172
You can't, Senpai!

99
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:54,469
<i>Sorry, Ichikawa.</i>
<i>I can't sacrifice a fellow officer's life.</i>

100
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,183
Great work, everyone!

101
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,062
This voice…

102
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,189
Hey, Kaiju.

103
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:09,401
Looks like I won.

104
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,665
I'm the vice-captain of this base.

105
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,712
My job is to hold on until she arrives.

106
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:33,258
-Okonogi, I'll be skipping the requests.
-<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

107
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,095
Let's blow him away.

108
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,536
<i>He's regenerating quickly!</i>

109
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,583
Captain, we think the core is in the back,
between the fourth and sixth vertebrae.

110
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,584
Roger!

111
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,215
Shit!

112
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,388
It won't be that easy, huh?

113
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:24,059
All right. I'll be pushing myself
a little bit more!

114
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,688
<i>Unleashed Combat Power, 63%.</i>

115
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,690
Technique Number Four, Wild Slasher!

116
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,239
<i>I'll wear out his mobility and create</i>
<i>an opportunity!</i>

117
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:38,949
Number Two, Cross Slasher!

118
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:44,162
It's too dangerous!
The suit is at its limit!

119
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,459
He regenerated…

120
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,883
<i>There's not enough output.</i>
<i>What should I do?</i>

121
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:00,762
Shinomiya!

122
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,097
Water Skimmer!

123
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:08,478
Shit. At my current state,
I can't even scratch him.

124
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,938
Keep going, Shinomiya.

125
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,691
I'll slice his outer shell.

126
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,776
Get him in the cracks!

127
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:24,828
<i>It went through!</i>

128
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,289
Shinomiya!

129
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:37,007
Is it overheating?

130
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:40,343
<i>You've done more than enough. Great work.</i>

131
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,687
The core is exposed!

132
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,357
We have one more shot left, Captain!

133
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,404
Back up the captain!

134
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,042
Vice-Captain! We're sorry we're late.

135
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,378
Don't give him the chance
to regenerate, you guys!

136
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,232
<i>Move!</i>

137
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,534
<i>Don't stop thinking!</i>

138
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,619
<i>Just five seconds longer!</i>

139
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,956
<i>I have to keep moving my body!</i>

140
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,631
<i>Slice!</i>

141
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,383
<i>Slice open a path!</i>

142
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:05,929
<i>That's the only way to prove</i>
<i>that I exist here!</i>

143
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,648
Thank you, Hoshina.

144
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,569
I'm so glad you are my vice-captain.

145
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,365
<i>Unleashed Combat Power, 96%.</i>

146
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,411
Now's my turn to pierce through the enemy!

147
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,374
Hey, you.

148
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:38,962
You picked a fight with the wrong person.

149
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:57,022
{\an8}NUMBER TWO

150
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,900
{\an8}<i>The honju has been defeated!</i>

151
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,488
Wow.

152
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,242
-We did it.
-Yeah.

153
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,412
All right!

154
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,200
As expected of Captain Ashiro.

155
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,452
I knew it.

156
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,331
This Defense Force that I've wanted
to join since I was a kid…

157
00:15:57,082 --> 00:16:00,001
These people are really cool!

158
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:05,215
I want to be a part of that one day!

159
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,510
Your face looks horrible, by the way.

160
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,220
What the hell?!

161
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,765
I'm moved! Don't be mean!
Don't act all cool!

162
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,686
It's only just begun.

163
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,230
We'll work hard, too.

164
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,694
Yeah.

165
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:30,240
Captain and I will be defeating
the rest of the yoju.

166
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,492
No. You rest.

167
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,119
You too, Captain.

168
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:39,416
<i>That's right. You only have 1%</i>
<i>remaining in your suit, Captain.</i>

169
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,918
You kept shooting rounds
with that much power.

170
00:16:42,002 --> 00:16:44,462
We'll take care of the rest of the yoju.

171
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,006
I'll be okay.

172
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:00,895
What is that?

173
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,777
The yoju are…?

174
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,114
I thought it cried out
because it was dying.

175
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,992
<i>The energy reaction is increasing.</i>

176
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,369
<i>It's a supergiant yoju bomb!</i>

177
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:20,665
The estimated TNT Conversion
of the explosion is 20 kilotons!

178
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,417
That's a nuclear explosion level!

179
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,170
Stop, don't shoot!

180
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,176
All officers, retreat!

181
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,680
<i>Shit. We won't make it.</i>

182
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:37,140
Humans.

183
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,895
Looks like this fight was…

184
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:44,397
a draw.

185
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,153
Don't, Senpai!

186
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:53,782
Kafka?

187
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,534
Retreat! You won't be able to do anything.

188
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,539
<i>Hold on. What is that speed?</i>

189
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,542
<i>Those aren't the movements</i>
<i>of a one-percenter.</i>

190
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,640
A supergiant kaiju has been detected
in the central base!

191
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,603
<i>Fortitude 9.8.</i>

192
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,148
<i>It's detecting…</i>

193
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,569
<i>Kaiju No. 8!</i>

194
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,451
<i>I always had my doubts.</i>

195
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,078
<i>Even so,</i>

196
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,789
<i>I took a liking to him</i>

197
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,086
<i>and kept pushing back that possibility.</i>

198
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,050
I'll keep my expectations at 1%.

199
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:57,679
<i>I'm sorry, Vice-Captain Hoshina.</i>

200
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:02,809
Fine. You did save me.
I'll keep it quiet for now.

201
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:07,313
<i>Sorry, Kikoru. Thank you</i>
<i>for keeping the secret.</i>

202
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:10,316
<i>Sorry, everyone, for keeping it a secret.</i>

203
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,944
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

204
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:17,949
<i>Sorry, Ichikawa.</i>
<i>Looks like I can't keep my promise.</i>

205
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,912
You're still a long way
from fighting by my side.

206
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,250
Mina! I… I…

207
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,712
Senpai! Do you know what you're

208
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,088
about to do right now?

209
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:43,141
<i>Everyone risked their lives</i>
<i>to fight today.</i>

210
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:47,729
<i>I can't be the only guy protecting myself!</i>

211
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,735
<i>I'm a member of the Defense Force.</i>

212
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,196
<i>I'm a Third Division officer, too!</i>

213
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:00,992
Now, it's my turn!

214
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,518
All officers, duck in place
and put up your shield!

215
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,948
<i>I've done it now, huh?</i>

216
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,742
<i>My arms and legs are all torn up.</i>

217
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,290
<i>I'm too old to be pushing myself</i>
<i>like this.</i>

218
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,295
Kafka Hibino.

219
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,881
No…

220
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,429
Kaiju No. 8.

221
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,023
We'll be taking you into custody.

222
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,961
