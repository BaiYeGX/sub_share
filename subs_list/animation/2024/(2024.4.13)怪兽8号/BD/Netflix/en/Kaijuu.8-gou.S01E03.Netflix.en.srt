1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,295
Fine. I'll move it myself.

2
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,214
<i>That suit…</i>

3
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:10,761
MONSTER SWEEPER INC.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,354
Who are you?

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,357
I'm applicant number 2016.

6
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:28,112
Kikoru Shinomiya.
My hobby is killing kaiju.

7
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,614
Remember my name, all right?

8
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,950
<i>Shinomiya!</i>

9
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:38,914
Hey, old man. You smell like kaiju.

10
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,626
Our work is cleaning up neutralized kaiju.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,629
Why are cleaners like you
at a place like this?

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,717
All right, then.

13
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,305
Does he have a private suit, too?

14
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,349
Applicant number 2032.

15
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:01,687
I'm Kafka Hibino.
Don't forget my name, little girl!

16
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,152
They took our parking spot
while I was talking!

17
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,154
That's one capable butler!

18
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,076
I just came here to participate
in the rite of passage,

19
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,411
but it looks like
I could enjoy my time here.

20
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:23,000
I can't wait to beat you, Kafka Hibino.

21
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,171
-Let's go, Sebasu.
-Yes, my lady.

22
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,683
You already used your powers.

23
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:44,688
Hey, you know, I just transformed
the parts where you can't see.

24
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:47,191
-That's not the problem here!
-Hey there!

25
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:50,069
We heard a loud noise.
Is there trouble here?

26
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,240
No, it's nothing. We're all right.

27
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,867
-Go inside quickly then!
-Understood!

28
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:04,208
If you use your powers again,
I'll send you back.

29
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,794
Okay.

30
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,674
<i>I gave up once,</i>

31
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,470
<i>but this is my last chance</i>
<i>to stand next to her!</i>

32
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,601
<i>I'll never…</i>

33
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,604
<i>give up this time!</i>

34
00:02:32,486 --> 00:02:36,115
ORIGINAL WORK BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

35
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,912
{\an8}<i>Shit. What's going on?</i>

36
00:04:06,247 --> 00:04:08,540
<i>I can't keep up at all.</i>

37
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,710
<i>I still keep up with my training</i>
<i>from old habits,</i>

38
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:14,588
<i>and I work at my physically demanding</i>
<i>job every day.</i>

39
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:18,926
The secondary exam has a physical
fitness test and an aptitude test.

40
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:23,472
Yes. The aptitude test looks at our
natural qualities. We can't control that.

41
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:26,225
-That means…
-Yeah.

42
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:30,020
We'll need to score high
on the physical fitness test.

43
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,945
<i>I was at least</i>
<i>a little below average last time!</i>

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,948
<i>So, why…</i>

45
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,000
<i>Is this what they mean when they say</i>
<i>your body declines in your thirties?</i>

46
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,672
<i>If I use my powers,</i>

47
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,175
<i>Could I outrun all of them in an instant?</i>

48
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,095
<i>Shit! My body is heavy.</i>

49
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,097
KAFKA HIBINO
PHYSICAL FITNESS TEST RANKING

50
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,350
219 OUT OF 225

51
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:11,353
KIKORU SHINOMIYA
5 OUT OF 225

52
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:16,483
Wow, that was fast. I beat you already.

53
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:24,616
I'm Kafka Hibino. Don't forget my name,
little girl… girl… girl!

54
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,786
Forget it!

55
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,497
Forget my name right this instant!

56
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:41,300
I feel at ease. So, you really didn't use

57
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,302
your kaiju powers.

58
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,891
Everyone worked hard to get here.

59
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,686
It would be unfair
if I used my powers here.

60
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,523
Look, I'm trying to act all cool,
but I should've used it!

61
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,442
I'm so rusty!

62
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,904
Your ranking might not just be
because you're rusty.

63
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,034
Here are the applicants this year.

64
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,328
There are some interesting people.

65
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:14,208
You probably only care
about beating kaiju, though.

66
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,754
Continue updating me.
I'll listen as I work.

67
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,881
Oh, wow, that's new.

68
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:25,844
Let's see.
I guess our star player would be…

69
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,554
Haruichi Izumo.

70
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,723
Tokyo Neutralization University.

71
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:31,100
Graduated at the top of class.

72
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:35,104
{\an8}He's the top player
out of this year's graduates.

73
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,148
Another hopeful is Iharu Furuhashi.

74
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:42,444
{\an8}Hachioji Neutralization Technical College,
graduated at the top of the class.

75
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:43,862
{\an8}IHARU FURUHASHI
THIRD PLACE

76
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,489
All right!

77
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:47,533
The young hopeful of JGSDF,

78
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,909
{\an8}Aoi Kaguragi.

79
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:49,952
{\an8}AOI KAGURAGI
FIRST PLACE

80
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:52,913
{\an8}He's a transfer applicant who declined
a promised future at JGSDF

81
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,040
in order to join the Defense Force.

82
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,959
That's not all.

83
00:06:57,042 --> 00:07:01,547
I see more neutralization universities
and technical college jackets than usual.

84
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,632
These are elites who would usually go

85
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,844
for management positions
rather than working on the field.

86
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,097
No wonder they're all so advanced.

87
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,225
And out of all of them, she's at the top.

88
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,604
She was the youngest and top graduate

89
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:20,649
of California Neutralization University
at the age of 16.

90
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,527
She's considered to be the best talent
in all of history.

91
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,988
She is Kikoru Shinomiya.

92
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,282
<i>I'll crush her!</i>

93
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,286
<i>How will my skills hold up to hers?</i>

94
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,288
<i>I'll be keeping an eye on her.</i>

95
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:40,210
Everyone here is extremely talented,
with Kikoru Shinomiya at the top.

96
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:44,006
-That's why you--
-So, she's--

97
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:48,218
Hello there. You finally
realized how great I am?

98
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:51,722
-Kafka Hibino--
-I didn't know you were that good!

99
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,475
Don't lay a finger on our lady!

100
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,102
What's up with that old guy?

101
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,229
Maybe he's a fan of Shinomiya.

102
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:05,152
That's the second time I saw you
lose today, Kafka Hibino.

103
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,405
How many more times will I see
that pathetic face of yours?

104
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,288
I'll beat you for sure today!

105
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:24,129
Except that I'm already on the edge
of being cut.

106
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,797
We still have hope.

107
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,968
For the upcoming aptitude test,
in the past two years,

108
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:32,304
they've had applicants clean up
kaiju remains.

109
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:33,889
What?

110
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,893
They assess your level of kaiju knowledge
and teamwork

111
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:42,856
while raising awareness that
neutralization isn't just defeating kaiju.

112
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:46,860
This is why I decided to work in cleaning
for my part-time job.

113
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,362
All right!

114
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,365
-Let's hope the next one will go well!
-Yeah!

115
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:52,699
{\an8}NUMBER TWO

116
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:54,868
{\an8}DEFENSE FORCE
TRAINING AREA TWO

117
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,870
So huge!

118
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:02,209
I'm the head of the selection committee
for the secondary exams

119
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,711
and the vice-captain
of the Third Division, Hoshina.

120
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:05,629
VICE-CAPTAIN OF THE THIRD DIVISION
SOSHIRO HOSHINA

121
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,174
The aptitude test will be held
in this training area.

122
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,393
You all will be working
with a kaiju in this training area.

123
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,894
<i>Clean-up!</i>

124
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,854
You'll be neutralizing it.

125
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,569
<i>-Neutra…</i>
<i>-…lizing?</i>

126
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,567
I thought we're cleaning up here!
Huh, Ichikawa-san?

127
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:12,070
I'm talking about the previous two years!
I'm disappointed too!

128
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:16,950
But we can't let you guys
go in there empty-handed.

129
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,703
You'll be wearing these.

130
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,001
This is by Izumo Tech.

131
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:28,545
The G-X4552, huh?

132
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,799
<i>What is this?</i>

133
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,676
<i>Amazing.</i>

134
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:37,971
<i>It's like the clothes are sticking</i>
<i>to my body.</i>

135
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:41,558
<i>Physical evaluation</i>
<i>and form assimilation complete.</i>

136
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,645
<i>Kaiju muscle fibers, fully operational.</i>

137
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,192
<i>I can feel the suit merging with my body.</i>

138
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,862
<i>I can feel my muscles expanding.</i>
<i>It's so hot.</i>

139
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,989
<i>So, this is…</i>

140
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,493
<i>These are the Defense Force's</i>
<i>Kaiju Countermeasure Suits.</i>

141
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:02,162
<i>It's made</i>
<i>from the biological tissue of kaiju</i>

142
00:11:02,245 --> 00:11:05,832
<i>and greatly raises the fighting ability</i>
<i>of the wearer.</i>

143
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:11,213
<i>This is the best weapon to fight</i>
<i>against kaiju for you guys that we have.</i>

144
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:15,050
I'll be measuring the unleashed combat
power for everyone who put on the suit.

145
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:16,676
Roger that!

146
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,428
<i>Reno Ichikawa.</i>

147
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,847
<i>Unleashed combat power, 8%.</i>

148
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,601
<i>Haruichi Izumo, 18%.</i>

149
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,728
That's around what I expected.

150
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:30,107
-<i>Aoi Kaguragi, 15%.</i>
-Yes, sir.

151
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,111
-<i>Iharu Furuhashi, 14%.</i>
-What?

152
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:38,740
Unleashed combat power measures how much
of the suit's power is being released.

153
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:41,868
If you've had a lot of training,
you'd be around 20%.

154
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:46,331
You'd usually be lucky if you see
one applicant over 10%.

155
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:51,169
We might really have the best pool
of applicants in our history.

156
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,713
-Seriously?
-The rumors are true.

157
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,632
Kikoru Shinomiya.

158
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,219
{\an8}Unleashed combat power is 46%!

159
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,145
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>She's already at Platoon Leader level!</i>

160
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,856
The best talent in history.

161
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,817
This might be the highest record
for any applicant!

162
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:16,069
I'm only at 8%.

163
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,448
<i>Don't be so down, Ichikawa-kun.</i>

164
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,659
Well, 8% is great for a first-timer.

165
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,163
Honestly, as long as you're not at zero
right now, you've passed.

166
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,708
Though I've never seen anyone
at zero in my time here!

167
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,168
Kafka Hibino.

168
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:34,713
{\an8}Unleashed combat power, 0%!

169
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,343
What's with that guy?
We have our first zero!

170
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:43,013
Maybe it's a measurement error.

171
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,557
Give me a bit more time!

172
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,392
I'm pushing right now!

173
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,355
Is he taking a shit?
Pushing won't do anything!

174
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:58,111
That old guy is hilarious!
I like that dude.

175
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,863
He probably won't pass, though.

176
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,865
Please focus on the selection process.

177
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,783
<i>Why?</i>

178
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,621
<i>Shit. I'm sure there's a trick to this.</i>

179
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,081
<i>I just have to figure it out</i>
<i>before the exam ends.</i>

180
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,960
<i>Kafka Hibino, don't make me impatient.</i>

181
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,672
<i>Show off the power you released</i>
<i>in the parking lot!</i>

182
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,466
<i>The exam's about to end.</i>

183
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:26,848
All right, everyone has their suits on?

184
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,601
Let's begin…

185
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,520
the final test.

186
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:38,318
{\an8}DEFENSE FORCE SELECTION EXAM
FINAL ROUND

187
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:40,237
Here's what will happen in this test.

188
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,325
The target is one honju that was placed
in this large training area

189
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,203
designed like an urban district
and 36 yoju.

190
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:52,082
We neutralized a kaiju that produced
16 victims in Hachioji last year

191
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,043
and captured it live
to train our newcomers.

192
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:59,589
You'll be in combat
using kaiju fighting weapons.

193
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,051
Each applicant will be monitored
by being followed

194
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:05,053
by an automatic tracking drone.

195
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,848
If we judge that your life is at risk,

196
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:12,018
we'll release the suit shield remotely.

197
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:15,647
But understand that this means
you will be disqualified from that point.

198
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,987
Honestly, from this point forward,
we can't guarantee that you'll survive.

199
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,991
Those who still have the will to continue…

200
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,742
proceed!

201
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,126
What the hell is that?

202
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,971
Yoju 12 has been eviscerated.

203
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,726
Yoju 3 has been eviscerated.

204
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,311
Damn.

205
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,563
-Wow.
-Amazing.

206
00:14:56,646 --> 00:15:00,901
Dammit, we're going, too!
Follow me, Ichikawa!

207
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,986
You're the one behind me!

208
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:06,823
These weapons are so heavy
without any power from the suit.

209
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:11,161
-Only a zero percenter could understand--
-That's not a cool line!

210
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,413
But what should we do?

211
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,041
We don't have much attacking power.

212
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,127
<i>Oh, right, I forgot to mention.</i>

213
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,089
We're joined by Captain Mina Ashiro
for our aptitude test selection.

214
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,675
Go ahead and show off what you've got!

215
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,555
Let's bet on who becomes
the coolest Defense Force officer!

216
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:34,851
<i>That's right. Who cares if I'm at zero?</i>

217
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:40,148
<i>Calm down.</i>
<i>This is my last and final chance.</i>

218
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,317
Ichikawa.

219
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:47,989
Why did the judges assign a drone
to follow each one of us?

220
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:53,244
You're right. If they only care about
how many kaiju we neutralize,

221
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,956
they can just use a sensor
to count the numbers.

222
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:02,504
Right. They're looking at how we act
based on our skills and situation.

223
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:07,467
In that case, what we should do
as someone with low attacking power is…

224
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,677
Exactly.

225
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,974
-We'll support the attackers!
-Yes!

226
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,396
Shit!

227
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,856
Senpai! They're fighting to your right.

228
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,317
All right. Let's go around
and support them.

229
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,831
<i>The shape of that hoof…</i>

230
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:43,628
<i>I remember! This is the yoju we cleaned</i>
<i>in collaboration with Iida Cleaners.</i>

231
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,338
<i>I see.</i>

232
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:49,384
<i>That's why they added this</i>
<i>to our collection of weapons.</i>

233
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:53,680
Take this!

234
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,316
A stun grenade?

235
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,362
This guy has developed hearing to make up
for his deteriorating eyesight.

236
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,866
So, we'll throw that off balance
and find a target!

237
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,284
-It's the belly!
-Huh?

238
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,829
The skin on his belly is thinner
than the rest of his body.

239
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:20,874
-Aim for the belly!
-What?

240
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:37,307
Nice assist. Shinomiya fan!

241
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,601
I'm not her fan!

242
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:51,279
-Nice job, Senpai!
-Thanks.

243
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,699
I haven't cleaned up
all those kaiju for nothing.

244
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,453
I know all about you, inside and out!

245
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,707
<i>I can do it without using my kaiju powers!</i>

246
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,461
<i>I'll compensate for all the mishaps</i>
<i>up to this point!</i>

247
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,964
I'll throw the next one!
Let's just keep going.

248
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,644
<i>Another kaiju?</i>

249
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:27,982
Senpai!

250
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,319
Area Delta, number 2032 has been injured.

251
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,572
Vitals are abnormal. He's unable to fight.

252
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,575
Yoju 23 is continuing to attack!

253
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,577
Prepare the remote shield.

254
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,166
Ouch…

255
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,586
<i>Shit. They're releasing the remote shield.</i>

256
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,215
Understand that this means
you will be disqualified.

257
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,096
<i>Stand up. She's…</i>

258
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,599
<i>She's watching me.</i>

259
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:06,855
<i>I can't be acting more pathetic</i>
<i>than I already am!</i>

260
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,857
Releasing the Remote Shield!

261
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,694
<i>So, he's the first one out, huh? Figures.</i>

262
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,155
<i>He was a funny dude,</i>

263
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:17,323
<i>but it can't be helped.</i>

264
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,755
That's your third losing face,
Kafka Hibino.

265
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:38,595
I won't allow any victims
where I'm fighting.

266
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,555
Kikoru! You saved me--

267
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,017
I'll take care of this gracefully.

268
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,769
You just lie there pathetically, okay?

269
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,651
-She's going for the main target!
-That's mine!

270
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,324
Don't be so distracted!

271
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:04,329
So powerful. Is it really
the same weapon as mine?

272
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,124
Unleashed combat power makes
a huge difference in our attacking force.

273
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,336
I'm going too!

274
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,378
Senpai!

275
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:17,008
<i>It's broken? I can't stand up anymore.</i>

276
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,928
<i>Can you hear me, number 2032?</i>

277
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,763
<i>It's Hoshina, from the operation room.</i>

278
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,683
Your vitals are abnormal.

279
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,561
Broken bones in various places.

280
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:32,315
There may be damages
to your internal organs.

281
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:35,109
No way.

282
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:38,696
<i>I have to give up?</i>

283
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:42,784
<i>But if I still have a chance, I'll….</i>

284
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:50,792
2032
KAFKA HIBINO

285
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,503
{\an8}UNLEASHED COMBAT POWER: 0%

286
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,298
<i>There's no way I could stand next to her.</i>

287
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,592
<i>There's no way.</i>

288
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:07,141
<i>It's always the talented ones who pass.</i>

289
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:15,775
As judges, we recommend that you retire.

290
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,903
The shield won't protect you
from everything.

291
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,826
<i>I'm the only one that can decide</i>

292
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,911
<i>whether to give up.</i>

293
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:29,247
Senpai.

294
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:33,501
I'm at no age to have dreams.

295
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,011
I know it's lame.

296
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:48,349
But I decided to bet
on my entire life so far

297
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,603
{\an8}to chase after this one thing.

298
