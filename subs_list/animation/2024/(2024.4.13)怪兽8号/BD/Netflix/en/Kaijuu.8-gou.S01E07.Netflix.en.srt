1
00:00:01,877 --> 00:00:04,171
Their debut match has begun.

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:07,758
Vice-Captain Hoshina! I found the core!

3
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:10,010
<i>-What?</i>
-It's at the base of the neck.

4
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,930
<i>And another thing. This is more important.</i>

5
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,975
The yoju have reproductive organs, too.

6
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:18,561
<i>If we don't destroy these,</i>

7
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:21,147
<i>more yoju might be born</i>
<i>from the dead bodies.</i>

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:25,985
Target captured.
No shooting attack target in the area.

9
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,237
<i>Roger. Begin shooting now.</i>

10
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,536
<i>Watch carefully, Kafka.</i>

11
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:41,333
<i>This is… the power of the person</i>
<i>you're working to stand next to.</i>

12
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,546
<i>Honju has been destroyed!</i>
<i>All movements have stopped.</i>

13
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,548
Just as expected.

14
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,633
Even with the honju dead,

15
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:53,054
the remaining yoju left in its dead body

16
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:56,057
will flood out at the end.

17
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:02,438
Hey, you didn't hear the alert?

18
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,607
Cleanup will be done later.

19
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,068
Him, too.

20
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,112
The reproductive organ I placed
has been destroyed.

21
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:14,575
Is there an officer
with extensive kaiju knowledge?

22
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:24,084
ORIGINAL WORK BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

23
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,128
{\an8}Damn!

24
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,755
{\an8}That honju's huge!

25
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,509
-Are Kafka and Ichikawa there?
-There's no way I can see them!

26
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:59,805
It makes sense that all cleaners in Tokyo
and Kanagawa were summoned for this.

27
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:02,016
Hey.

28
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:05,144
-You guys see the newbie?
-What?

29
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,898
He's probably locked himself
in the bathroom again.

30
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:12,651
-Should I go call for him?
-Yeah, please do.

31
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,864
Hey, you. This area's still dangerous.

32
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,824
Wait until there are instructions…

33
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:25,873
Run, Iharu-kun!

34
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:33,172
Dang, I missed his heart.

35
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:36,550
My accuracy isn't as good in this form.

36
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,303
Iharu-kun!

37
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,972
-It won't stop bleeding, shit!
-Calm down!

38
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,557
Control the bleeding.

39
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,685
What the hell are you?

40
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:47,978
<i>A kaiju?</i>

41
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,564
<i>A humanoid kaiju who's not Senpai?</i>
<i>That means…</i>

42
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:59,323
The humanoid kaiju that appeared
at the exam arena!

43
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,576
He's the one that got Shinomiya?

44
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,827
Most likely.

45
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:08,332
Well, it'd be a waste to retreat now.

46
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:13,212
Maybe I'll get some live samples
of some officers.

47
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:19,510
Platoon Leader Ikaruga! We've encountered
a humanoid kaiju. Please provide backup.

48
00:04:20,219 --> 00:04:21,345
Platoon Leader!

49
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,056
-No way!
-Sure, sure.

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,060
Wireless communication, right?
I already dealt with that.

51
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:32,773
We're in an area
that can't be detected by the outside.

52
00:04:32,856 --> 00:04:36,110
It was originally used
to sneak into the human world.

53
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,196
But it's useful for hunting, too.

54
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,284
Reno!

55
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:48,789
Huh?

56
00:04:49,373 --> 00:04:52,042
I keep missing my aim.

57
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,423
<i>It penetrates the suit shield easily.</i>

58
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:58,799
<i>But…</i>

59
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,051
Oh, I see.

60
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,929
You can see it, right?

61
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:09,435
Right. I'll let you know
in case you encounter him.

62
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,272
It looks like magic or a spell at first,

63
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:14,940
but watch his fingers.

64
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,692
There's a pattern to his movements.

65
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:22,489
<i>I can dodge it!</i>

66
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,034
He dodged it!

67
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,745
I knew it.

68
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,128
Iharu-kun, leave and call for backup.

69
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:40,632
Why do I have to be protected by you?

70
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:50,059
-Ow!
-Iharu-kun!

71
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,062
Please go.

72
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,913
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

73
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,166
<i>He even got Shinomiya.</i>

74
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,460
<i>There's no way I could beat him.</i>

75
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:21,173
<i>But the officer I want to be is…</i>

76
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:22,966
<i>Run, Ichikawa!</i>

77
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,844
Once you're in a safe area, make a report.

78
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:28,388
<i>…a man who can risk his life</i>

79
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,850
<i>for his friends at a time like this!</i>

80
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,943
<i>I can at least buy enough time</i>
<i>for Iharu-kun to call for backup.</i>

81
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:45,864
<i>Reno's completely different</i>
<i>from the way he was yesterday.</i>

82
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:49,660
<i>What the hell? How is he able</i>
<i>to fight a thing like that?</i>

83
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,832
Shit!

84
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,793
I hate him!

85
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,505
There's a barrier
to unleashed combat power.

86
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,049
It's around 20% to 30%.

87
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,553
Only a few people
can get over that barrier.

88
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,764
But everyone has the potential
to be that person.

89
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:15,227
<i>I haven't gotten past 20%</i>
<i>for over two weeks now.</i>

90
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,772
<i>Ever since that day,</i>

91
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,525
<i>I've only thought about how to be strong.</i>

92
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:23,944
<i>But…</i>

93
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,113
<i>But…</i>

94
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,243
<i>He outran me so easily.</i>

95
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,206
I hate him!

96
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:47,885
Sounds like you had information
about me beforehand.

97
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,596
But you don't know this, do you?

98
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,901
Huh?

99
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,906
Iharu-kun? Why…

100
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,202
<i>That's not it. It's not Reno I hate.</i>

101
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,498
<i>It's the guy who hasn't changed</i>
<i>a bit since that day.</i>

102
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,376
<i>The guy who's always</i>
<i>being protected. It's me!</i>

103
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,466
Listen up, Reno.

104
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,719
You're not the one protecting me.

105
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,974
I'm the one protecting you, dumbass!

106
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:37,976
Iharu-kun!

107
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,481
Can't understand them one bit.

108
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:46,485
-I thought you were calling for help.
-Shut up.

109
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,239
If I didn't come back,
you would've been killed.

110
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:55,244
I see. He was trying to let him escape.

111
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,995
What a waste.

112
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:02,000
Nothing and no one can leave
this area without my permission.

113
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,377
You hear that?

114
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,879
We just have to take our chances.

115
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,635
Let's crush that thing together, Reno!

116
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,682
But I'm in this state.

117
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,268
I'll be your backup and distract him.

118
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:22,938
Crush him with your best shot!

119
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:23,855
Yes!

120
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:26,900
Let's go, Reno!

121
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,574
<i>A conductor round?</i>

122
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,784
Don't think you're the only one

123
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,703
trying out different bullets!

124
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,913
It's hard to move around with this.

125
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,582
Maybe I'll stop him first.

126
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,458
<i>Watch carefully.</i>

127
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,336
<i>I took it once. I know the timing now.</i>

128
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,010
This one, too?

129
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:56,972
Now, Reno!

130
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,934
Combat Power, Maximum Release!

131
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,398
<i>Please, God. Just this once.</i>

132
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,235
<i>Just for this moment, please give me power</i>

133
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,822
<i>that's stronger than Shinomiya</i>
<i>or Captain Ashiro.</i>

134
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:16,325
<i>Please!</i>

135
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,342
What the hell?!

136
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:36,762
A wall of dead bodies?

137
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,935
Looks like you've exhausted

138
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:48,774
all your options now, huh?

139
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,152
Reno!

140
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:04,289
<i>Vice-Captain Hoshina.</i>
<i>This is Platoon Leader Ikaruga.</i>

141
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,207
What's up?

142
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,541
<i>I've lost contact</i>

143
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:09,503
<i>with Officers Ichikawa and Furuhashi</i>
<i>for a while now.</i>

144
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,755
What?

145
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,925
<i>We cannot detect</i>
<i>any wireless network vitals at all!</i>

146
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:17,427
<i>Ichikawa?</i>

147
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:22,265
Did that move for a second?

148
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,936
Kafka Hibino!

149
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,438
Kikoru! This signal, does this mean…

150
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:30,941
Yeah. He's here.

151
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,403
Ichikawa, Iharu!

152
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:39,157
Reno!

153
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,621
<i>My body is hot all over.</i>

154
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:50,001
<i>Stop the bleeding and stand up.</i>
<i>I'm still alive.</i>

155
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:52,629
<i>The fighting isn't over.</i>

156
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,386
You're still moving?

157
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,972
It's harder than I thought

158
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,600
to stop all functions
while keeping them alive.

159
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,644
Like I'd let you do that!

160
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,152
I'm tired of that already.

161
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:23,493
All right. Let's finish this one up.

162
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,333
Is this too weak?

163
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:38,842
-Shit!
-It still moves. How's this?

164
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,976
<i>My friend's being hurt in front of me,</i>

165
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,061
<i>and I can't do anything?</i>

166
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,565
<i>It pisses me off,</i>

167
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,610
<i>and I don't want to admit it,</i>

168
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,613
<i>but Reno's a super strong guy.</i>

169
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,075
<i>I know he's going to be Captain one day.</i>

170
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,788
I won't let his life end here!

171
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,880
This one is nice and ready,

172
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,132
so, I don't need you any more.

173
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,266
<i>Please, God.</i>

174
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,939
<i>I don't care if it's a demon</i>
<i>or a devil. Please…</i>

175
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,525
<i>Please help Reno.</i>

176
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,446
<i>Please help…</i>

177
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,074
<i>my friend.</i>

178
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,078
You can die now.

179
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,041
You're the one that's dying, you bastard!

180
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,092
<i>What just happened?</i>

181
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,346
<i>I can see my body.</i>

182
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,892
<i>I see. He decapitated me.</i>

183
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:15,897
Sorry for being late.

184
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,903
<i>I'm so weak.</i>

185
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,031
<i>I tried so hard</i>

186
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,076
<i>so it wouldn't come to this.</i>

187
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:31,079
<i>But even then,</i>

188
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:36,585
<i>I made him transform again.</i>

189
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,423
Another humanoid?

190
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,346
You must be <i>that.</i>

191
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,348
The much rumored

192
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:54,019
Kaiju No. 8.

193
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:02,319
Sorry, Ichikawa.
It might take a bit longer.

194
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,365
It'll be okay. Calm down.

195
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:10,410
Stop the bleeding one by one,
using your suit.

196
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,955
I don't have to teach you that!

197
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,583
I don't know how.

198
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,969
Senpai, be careful.

199
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:31,473
Yeah. Leave it to me.

200
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:35,727
<i>I know that Senpai's strong.</i>

201
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,189
<i>But I have a bad feeling about this.</i>

202
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,025
It's fine, but you're a kaiju.

203
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:45,403
Why do you get in my way?

204
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:50,241
And you're a much stronger kaiju
than I thought.

205
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,371
I'd love to have your dead body
as my chess piece.

206
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,751
<i>He injured Senpai in his kaiju form?</i>

207
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,420
I see. You're tough.

208
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,048
In order to kill you…

209
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,135
will this be enough?

210
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,554
<i>That kaiju…</i>

211
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:15,225
<i>He wasn't trying at all with us!</i>

212
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,727
-Run, Senpai!
-I see.

213
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:23,233
You shot this thing in their bodies

214
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,444
over and over?

215
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,501
Huh?

216
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,215
<i>What's going on?</i>

217
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,678
The wall of dead bodies!

218
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:54,973
<i>I'll take this time to reconstruct.</i>

219
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:57,517
<i>What?</i>

220
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:03,523
<i>What's with him? Protect the body.</i>
<i>Avoid a direct hit.</i>

221
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,402
<i>He's beating me? This isn't normal.</i>

222
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,029
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

223
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,365
<i>I don't have time</i>
<i>to reconstruct the damage.</i>

224
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:16,036
<i>Confusion. Retreat for now.</i>

225
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:19,873
<i>Don't have time to retreat.</i>

226
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,960
The core is in the body, right?

227
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:27,964
I'm blowing you away, so brace yourself.

228
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,967
<i>This isn't good.</i>

229
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:52,655
<i>The core got exposed completely.</i>

230
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:01,706
It's over.

231
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:08,588
This is Platoon Leader Ikaruga.

232
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:10,757
We've discovered a humanoid kaiju!

233
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,765
There's not enough power.

234
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,282
Where did he go?

235
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:43,331
You're going to find Reno and Iharu?

236
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,501
We lost communication with them,
and we can't sense their vitals.

237
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,002
So, how…

238
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:50,588
If they're with the humanoid from before…

239
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,134
{\an8}NEUTRALIZATION BUREAU

240
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,344
{\an8}…I'd be able to sense them.

241
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:02,600
Kikoru! I leave this area to you.

242
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,479
Hey!

243
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,024
<i>Transforming in a place like this?</i>

244
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,610
<i>This is Platoon Leader Ikaruga!</i>

245
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:15,572
<i>We've spotted a humanoid kaiju</i>
<i>in District Foxtrot,</i>

246
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,948
<i>Southeast Area!</i>

247
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,910
<i>Physical traits match those</i>
<i>of Kaiju No. 8.</i>

248
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,663
Roger. We'll send a neutralization unit
right away.

249
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,665
That idiot!

250
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,174
The mimetic space broke, huh?

251
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,092
But thanks to that…

252
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:38,595
you got distracted.

253
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,846
Shit!

254
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:45,101
I understand your traits now.
Next time, I can kill you.

255
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,978
I won't let you escape!

256
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:58,448
You act like a human,
even though you're a kaiju.

257
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,368
Let's meet again, Kaiju No. 8.

258
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,789
Shit! There's nothing I can do.
I have to leave now, too.

259
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,674
-He got away!
-Let's rescue the injured officers.

260
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,845
<i>I'm glad. I let the humanoid escape,</i>

261
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,264
<i>but I achieved my goal.</i>

262
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:40,281
A pitch black body
and a demon-like skull mask.

263
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,286
I finally caught your tail,

264
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,288
Kaiju No. 8.

265
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,084
<i>Vice-Captain Hoshina?</i>

266
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,587
This is Hoshina. I'm in District Foxtrot.

267
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:56,631
<i>I've made contact with Kaiju No. 8.</i>

268
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,638
So, you've met my officers, huh?

269
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,393
<i>No, Vice-Captain Hoshina.</i>

270
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,645
<i>That is…</i>

271
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:28,955
I'm better at the small
and mid-sized kaiju than her.

272
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:31,457
<i>He wasn't lying.</i>

273
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:35,461
<i>He's well-experienced</i>
<i>at fighting small kaiju.</i>

274
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,338
His skin is so tough!

275
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,882
I'm sure I got two or three cuts in.

276
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:44,262
<i>I've only seen him smiling and friendly.</i>

277
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,179
<i>But this is…</i>

278
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,932
Looks like I have to get serious.

279
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,936
<i>…what Vice-Captain Hoshina looks like</i>
<i>when he's about to kill a kaiju.</i>

280
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:55,440
Applying for permission
to release the limiter control.

281
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:57,191
<i>Roger.</i>

282
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,529
I'll take care of No. 8.

283
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:05,408
<i>Unleashed combat power, 92%.</i>

284
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,828
I'll neutralize him.

285
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:39,919
