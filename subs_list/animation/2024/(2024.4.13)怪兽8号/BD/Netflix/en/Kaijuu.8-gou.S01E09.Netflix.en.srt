1
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,473
Kaiju No. 8.

2
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,569
I picked up strange
human-like traits from him.

3
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:29,071
In addition,

4
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:32,408
No. 9 can speak and look like a human.

5
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,538
<i>What's going on with kaiju?</i>

6
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>Vice-Captain!</i>

7
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,383
I'm going to work hard to contribute!

8
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:53,512
I'll keep my expectations at 1%.

9
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:01,604
I want to meet his expectations.

10
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,524
Finally, my first step!

11
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,112
I'll go back to sleep
to prepare for tomorrow.

12
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,199
Resting is a part of work, too!

13
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:35,095
ORIGINAL WORK BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

14
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,341
Operation Room! What's going on?

15
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,010
Several dozen kaiju have appeared
inside the base!

16
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:39,428
Judging from the situation,

17
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:42,556
Kaiju are attacking from the sky!

18
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,226
Estimated power is 6.1.

19
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:50,689
6.3, 6.2, 6.5… All the kaiju are…

20
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,691
A kaiju?

21
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,276
Honju class!

22
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,170
It's Hoshina.
Captain Ashiro isn't present.

23
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:15,381
So, I'll be giving out instructions.

24
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,384
All night security officers,
get into combat.

25
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:21,136
Send out a dispatch
to off-duty officers as well.

26
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,514
-Everyone, get prepared for combat.
-Roger!

27
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,516
<i>Try to lure them to the training ground.</i>

28
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,893
<i>Don't let a single kaiju escape the base!</i>

29
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,897
<i>No damage reports from the outside.</i>

30
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,899
<i>Could it be…</i>

31
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,737
<i>their target is this base?</i>

32
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,824
What the hell's going on?

33
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,413
The base is a sea of fire!

34
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,625
Wyvern-type Kaiju！

35
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,794
Those are troublesome.

36
00:04:57,673 --> 00:04:58,924
<i>Wyvern-types?</i>

37
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:02,428
<i>If so, there's something wrong with them!</i>

38
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,641
Place the officers good at shooting
in the center.

39
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,019
-Let's lure them and shoot them down.
-Roger!

40
00:05:14,565 --> 00:05:15,649
<i>Vice-Captain!</i>

41
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:18,569
-Kafka, you're safe?
-<i>Yes, sir.</i>

42
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,780
-Something bothers me about these kaiju.
-Report.

43
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:26,035
About ten or so wyvern-type kaiju
are reported in a year,

44
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,038
and they all share a common trait.

45
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:30,998
They only act on their own.

46
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,918
<i>But these guys are acting as a group.</i>

47
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:38,172
Yeah. That means
there's only one possibility.

48
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,470
There's a force strong enough
to lead these prideful wyvern-types.

49
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:46,597
Something acting with purpose,

50
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,724
with high intellect.

51
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,061
They have a super powerful leader.

52
00:05:57,524 --> 00:06:00,235
Target found.

53
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,029
I'm hanging up, Kafka.

54
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,038
Are you the strongest one in this base?

55
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,791
<i>This one speaks human, too?</i>

56
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:18,170
Captain's not here,
so I guess it would be me.

57
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,089
I see.

58
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:25,094
It's decided, then. You'll be my prey.

59
00:06:25,803 --> 00:06:29,098
Estimated fortitude of the honju
has been calculated! 8.3!

60
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,600
It's a Daikaiju Class!

61
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,228
-Ikaruga, can you hear me?
-<i>Yes, sir!</i>

62
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,730
You take the lead to defeat the yoju.

63
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,024
First priority is civilian harm prevention

64
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,277
-and protecting the main office!
-<i>Roger!</i>

65
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,779
I'll take care of the honju.

66
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,575
You dodged it, huh? You've passed.

67
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:05,592
I have to be the one
to take care of this one.

68
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,719
All right.

69
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,974
Now, the annihilation

70
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,436
has officially begun.

71
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:36,498
The yoju are responding to him?

72
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,960
I knew it. This base was the target.

73
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,216
<i>He's crazy strong, like a meteor!</i>

74
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:49,636
<i>If I take that attack head-on,</i>
<i>it's the end of me.</i>

75
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,564
<i>His exterior's harder than No. 8!</i>

76
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,484
Shoot!

77
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,239
He's unharmed!

78
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:17,581
Retreat! Shooters, change the bullets
to Oscillator Rounds.

79
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,665
<i>Don't shoot the front!</i>

80
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,834
This voice… Is this Hibino?

81
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,587
Aim for the back. This kaiju

82
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,840
is the same type recorded in the Year 03.

83
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:29,468
-Senpai?
-Is that Old Man?

84
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,678
I couldn't reach you. I was worried.

85
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,056
<i>Sorry. I was talking to Vice-Captain.</i>

86
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,433
<i>Forget that. Aim for the back!</i>

87
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:40,354
They're often attacked when flying,
so their frontal skin is tougher.

88
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,106
<i>Their core is in their back.</i>

89
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,067
<i>Their backs have minimal toughness</i>

90
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,070
<i>to maintain their light weight for flight!</i>

91
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,321
Great work, Hibino!

92
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:54,868
Split in two. Keep them distracted
in the front and shoot the back!

93
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:55,827
Roger!

94
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,914
-Stay back.
-I'll take the lead, thanks.

95
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:06,838
I'll be the bait.

96
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,841
Go around, Haruichi! You owe me one!

97
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,560
<i>As expected of him.</i>

98
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,860
Combat Power, Maximum Release!

99
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,578
<i>The kaiju are working together?</i>

100
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:42,124
-<i>We can't get behind them!</i>
-<i>Same here.</i>

101
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,585
-<i>There was kaiju interception.</i>
-What?

102
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:46,044
<i>What should we do?</i>

103
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,423
<i>If we can't get behind them,</i>
<i>how can we shoot their backs?</i>

104
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:52,467
-<i>There's another way.</i>
-Shinomiya?

105
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,052
What is it?

106
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,025
I could…

107
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,116
overtake them from the front…

108
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,126
with my immense power!

109
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:33,675
{\an8}TACHIKAWA BASE BASEMENT
WEAPONS STORAGE ROOM

110
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,136
A weapon made especially for me?

111
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,431
I thought only captain-ranked officers
got them.

112
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,891
That's usually the case.

113
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,061
In light of the situation,
we decided to give you one.

114
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:47,397
The strength and number of kaiju
is abnormal this year.

115
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,777
We've decided to add you
to the core force of the base,

116
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,321
as someone
with the third-highest combat power.

117
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:08,418
Shinomiya. Starting now, annihilate kaiju
as the Number Three,

118
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,588
<i>after the captain and vice-captain.</i>

119
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,887
{\an8}The power's okay,
considering it's a prototype.

120
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,806
If I had any complaints,

121
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,144
it's that it looks too rugged
and doesn't suit me.

122
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,980
She crushed it from the front!

123
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,566
All right, kaiju.

124
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,320
Now that I'm on the battleground,

125
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,322
no more playing around.

126
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,209
<i>Its main material is the uniorgan</i>

127
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,295
<i>of a honju that was neutralized</i>
<i>in Shinagawa two years ago.</i>

128
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,049
If you turn on the power with the trigger,
it'll release a shock wave.

129
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,968
<i>Application one,</i>

130
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,096
<i>release shock wave to the back</i>
<i>while it's in motion.</i>

131
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,809
Speed up!

132
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:12,649
Squadron-Style Ax Technique
Number One - Falling Thunder!

133
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:21,658
<i>Application two,</i>

134
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,996
<i>release shock wave to the front</i>
<i>during collision.</i>

135
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,372
More force!

136
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,500
Technique Number Two - Water Skimmer.

137
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,086
Wow!

138
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,505
It doesn't suit me, my ass.

139
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:42,012
It's the perfect match for your aggressive
and dominating personality.

140
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:44,264
Next up!

141
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,974
Above?

142
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,731
<i>Freeze Rounds?</i>

143
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,990
-Reno!
-Stay alert. They're attacking from above.

144
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,121
Like I'd let you fly!

145
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,835
<i>He's doing well fighting</i>
<i>against such a high-level kaiju.</i>

146
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:21,927
Technique Number Three - Half Moon!

147
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:31,645
-All right!
<i>-Reno.</i>

148
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,647
<i>I'll let you back me up.</i>

149
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,941
If you can keep up, that is.

150
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,026
Bring it on!

151
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,655
All right, let's join forces
and stir up the enemy.

152
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,324
You hear that?

153
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:49,079
Yeah. Creating a disturbance with only
two people? As expected of Shinomiya.

154
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,123
We can't be left behind by them.

155
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,251
In that case, we'll…

156
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:57,087
Get behind the enemy
after they've been lured by Shinomiya!

157
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,217
Squad Shinomiya will break up
the kaiju coordination!

158
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,929
We're continuing with our plan!
Split into two and shoot their backs!

159
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,393
<i>Sounds like Shinomiya</i>
<i>will take care of that.</i>

160
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:12,894
The problem is…

161
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:19,943
this guy!

162
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,004
He's strong.

163
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,048
<i>Not only that, he's…</i>

164
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,176
<i>enjoying the fight.</i>

165
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,184
<i>-Okonogi-chan, release Gate Three!</i>
-Roger!

166
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:57,188
{\an8}NUMBER THREE

167
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:01,192
<i>He's expressing emotion</i>
<i>beyond what kaiju are capable of.</i>

168
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:14,497
We opened that gate for nothing!
Doors are expensive, you know!

169
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,083
<i>Where is he?</i>

170
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:20,754
No one can fight this well against me.

171
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,715
Not even most kaiju.

172
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,218
I'd love to eat you
and use you for sustenance.

173
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,477
<i>Vice-Captain!</i>

174
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,857
You're really strong, you know.

175
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,737
<i>Sorry, Okonogi-chan.</i>

176
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,406
<i>It's an emergency.</i>
<i>I didn't have time to ask for permission.</i>

177
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,037
At least in this training ground,

178
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,666
I won't get other officers involved
if I get serious.

179
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:04,422
<i>Combat Power Maximum Release, 92%.</i>

180
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,343
Let's begin this neutralization, shall we?

181
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:14,432
So powerful!

182
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,315
<i>Will I not make it?</i>

183
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,110
<i>I could do a partial transformation!</i>

184
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,667
Hibino-san?

185
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,503
-Are you hurt, Minase?
-I'm okay, thanks!

186
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,673
You've gotten better at using that suit!

187
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,055
I've become a general officer and all.
I can manage this!

188
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,015
Behind you!

189
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,521
Kikoru!

190
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,607
-Kikorun!
-Are you all right, Senpai?

191
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,069
Reno and I are luring the kaiju.

192
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,488
Meanwhile, take care of the injured.

193
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,740
Roger!

194
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,908
Senpai.

195
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,995
Don't do something dangerous, okay?

196
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,664
You're a general officer now.

197
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,293
Have trust in the squad.

198
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:26,171
-Yeah!
-I'll see you later!

199
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,224
Wow!

200
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,352
When did they learn
to work so well together?

201
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:47,567
<i>Reporting!</i>
<i>Platoon Nakanoshima has arrived!</i>

202
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,070
Sorry for the wait, Ikaruga!

203
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,948
Platoon Ebina has also arrived!
They're heading south to assist.

204
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,077
Don't enjoy yourselves too much, kaiju!

205
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,580
The off-duty senpai are all here!

206
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,501
<i>Squad Shinomiya and Platoon Wagatsuma</i>
<i>have defeated two yoju!</i>

207
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:08,588
This is Platoon Takao. We've completed
the formation of the shooting squad.

208
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,424
We'll be using Freeze Rounds
to attack the yoju in the sky.

209
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,345
This is Platoon Itakura.
We've secured the storage area.

210
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:20,433
We're beginning to push back, even
in an emergency with the captain absent.

211
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,854
-Minase. Let's go care for the injured!
-Yeah!

212
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,274
<i>They're amazing.</i>

213
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,112
<i>Not just Kikoru and Ichikawa,</i>
<i>everyone is crazy strong.</i>

214
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,739
<i>This is the division I'm a part of.</i>

215
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:37,534
<i>This is…</i>

216
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,036
<i>The Third Division!</i>

217
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,165
You picked a fight with the wrong guys.

218
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:48,670
We'll be winning this one.

219
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:02,767
<i>He did it again. Same as the attack</i>
<i>that took out this arm.</i>

220
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,108
<i>He is precise in slicing</i>

221
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,944
<i>the gap between my shells.</i>

222
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:17,157
<i>This is boring. It's a cheap trick.</i>

223
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:22,203
<i>Once I know where he's aiming,</i>
<i>I can fight back.</i>

224
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,711
Hoshina-style Sword-Slay Technique
Number Two,

225
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,129
Cross Slasher.

226
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:34,048
Number Four,

227
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,717
Wild Slasher!

228
00:19:37,135 --> 00:19:40,013
<i>Aiming for the gaps was just a diversion?</i>

229
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:53,151
This is what real fighting is!

230
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:11,586
Clashing face-to-face
with an equal opponent!

231
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,630
Equal!

232
00:20:14,505 --> 00:20:16,841
Equal!

233
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,768
What?

234
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,729
Your core's smaller than expected.

235
00:20:31,356 --> 00:20:32,774
Number Six,

236
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,152
Eightfold Slasher.

237
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,072
He did it!

238
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,201
-As expected of Vice-Captain!
-You see that, kaiju?

239
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,123
-This is…
<i>-We're not done!</i>

240
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,217
-Hibino-san? What's wrong?
-I'm okay.

241
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,972
<i>What's going on? I haven't transformed,</i>
<i>but my perception's reacting.</i>

242
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,266
<i>Vice-Captain.</i>

243
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,823
<i>He grew?</i>

244
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,951
<i>Was I unable to destroy his core</i>
<i>because it changed position?</i>

245
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,879
<i>An ultra-high temperature vapor.</i>

246
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,882
<i>I'm glad I lured him</i>
<i>to the training ground.</i>

247
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,719
A release of heat
and an increase in fortitude!

248
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,887
This is…

249
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,106
<i>Fortitude</i>

250
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,026
<i>9.0!</i>

251
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:40,002
