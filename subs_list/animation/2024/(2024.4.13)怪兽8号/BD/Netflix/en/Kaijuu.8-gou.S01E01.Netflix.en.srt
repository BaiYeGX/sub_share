<i>To CP. This is Alpha Two.</i>

2
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,972
<i>Point One. Nothing</i>
<i>out of the ordinary so far.</i>

3
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,892
<i>Alpha Two, this is CP.</i>
<i>Continue monitoring the situation.</i>

4
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,825
<i>Emergency kaiju alert.</i>

5
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,829
YOKOHAMA GATE
EMERGENCY UNDERGROUND SHELTER

6
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:41,375
<i>Emergency kaiju alert for Minami,</i>
<i>Naka, and Isogo Wards.</i>

7
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,838
<i>All those in the designated zones,</i>
<i>please proceed to a shelter immediately.</i>

8
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,051
<i>As for the movements of the epicenter…</i>

9
00:00:56,766 --> 00:00:59,226
<i>The target is moving</i>
<i>from Yatobashi to Yamashitacho.</i>

10
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,898
{\an8}<i>Estimated full length is 60 meters.</i>
<i>Fortitude is a little less than 3.5.</i>

11
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,579
-<i>No thermal detection for 3 kilometers.</i>
-<i>Roger that.</i>

12
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:21,373
<i>All crafts, begin shooting. I repeat.</i>

13
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:24,084
-<i>Begin shooting.</i>
-<i>Roger that.</i>

14
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,878
<i>Leading target to TO.</i>

15
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,671
<i>Shoot.</i>

16
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:35,596
Will the intimidation work?

17
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,848
Which division is coming?

18
00:01:38,474 --> 00:01:40,226
It's Yokohama, so, the Third Division.

19
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,807
Geez, what a mess.

20
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:07,021
We'll be working overtime for a while.

21
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,316
All right, let's get to work!

22
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,151
Yes, sir.

23
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:17,698
<i>Members of the Third Division,</i>
<i>who successfully subdued the kaiju,</i>

24
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,700
<i>are welcomed by the applause of locals.</i>

25
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:24,622
<i>The Third Division</i>
<i>achieved zero casualties.</i>

26
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,540
-<i>Thanks to them…</i>
-Captain Ashiro's here!

27
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:28,125
How cool!

28
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,630
<i>Let us thank them</i>
<i>with applause and cheers.</i>

29
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,507
Hey, don't forget to film the victims!

30
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,967
Oh, sorry.

31
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,471
-Report back to me later!
-Yes, sir!

32
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:41,847
Captain Ashiro!

33
00:03:55,778 --> 00:04:00,658
<i>Our work begins</i>
<i>after everything has ended.</i>

34
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,536
<i>No one gives us attention.</i>

35
00:04:05,287 --> 00:04:07,998
<i>No one thanks us either.</i>

36
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,418
<i>But it's our way of battling kaiju,</i>

37
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,884
<i>behind the scenes,</i>
<i>away from the spotlight.</i>

38
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:19,885
KAFKA HIBINO

39
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:23,472
<i>Kafka! Izumo Tech wants some samples.</i>

40
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:27,101
<i>Thanks.</i>

41
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,895
It's no good! I can't cut past the grease.

42
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,107
-Bring me the heat chainsaw!
-Yes, sir!

43
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,651
Hey, wait a minute!
You can't lift that yet!

44
00:04:44,118 --> 00:04:45,661
It's this way! Bring the stretcher.

45
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,247
Don't worry, it's just the surface.

46
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,584
I've done this many times.
Don't forget to apply for workers' comp.

47
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:53,752
Yes, sir!

48
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:58,257
The Third Division's site is always messy.

49
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,092
It's hard to recognize the organs.

50
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,053
Jesus, look at this.

51
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:06,265
Will we really finish this week?

52
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,729
Kafka, we're moving you.

53
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:14,356
-We don't have enough people over there.
-Where is it?

54
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:16,984
The intestines.

55
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:23,324
-I don't want to!
-I already got permission. Let's go!

56
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,200
Sorry about that!

57
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:29,204
I always hear about it,
but is working the intestines that rough?

58
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:32,958
{\an8}Think about it.
What's inside the intestines?

59
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:33,959
{\an8}HOW THE BODY WORKS

60
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,545
The days we work intestines…

61
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,799
you can't eat for days.

62
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,644
I'm so tired!

63
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:56,231
<i>Those baby pandas were so cute!</i>

64
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:57,858
<i>How will they grow up?</i>

65
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:00,819
I can still smell it.

66
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,072
<i>Let's move on to the next topic.</i>

67
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:08,994
<i>Defense Force Third Division,</i>
<i>which successfully subdued the kaiju</i>

68
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,246
<i>that suddenly appeared in the streets</i>
<i>of Yokohama.</i>

69
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:17,503
<i>The leader of that division</i>
<i>is Officer Mina Ashiro-san.</i>

70
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,713
<i>At the young age of 27,</i>

71
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:23,926
<i>she not only became the captain</i>
<i>but has already defeated</i>

72
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:25,803
{\an8}<i>hundreds of kaiju.</i>

73
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:26,929
SPECIAL FEATURE:
ZOOMING IN ON THE THIRD DIVISION

74
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,556
Let's defeat all the kaiju together!

75
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,271
CAPTAIN MINA ASHIRO

76
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,774
<i>Her calm and dignified disposition</i>

77
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,444
<i>makes her one of the most popular captains</i>
<i>of the entire Defense Force.</i>

78
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,489
<i>She's rumored to be the next</i>
<i>potential Division Commander.</i>

79
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,950
<i>She's definitely an up-and-coming star.</i>

80
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,712
Why am I over here?

81
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:04,007
Don't think about it!

82
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:08,220
Cleaning is important work
that also helps people!

83
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,348
I have a nice room

84
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,308
and can eat whatever I want.

85
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,854
That's enough, isn't it?

86
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,488
<i>My head hurts.</i>

87
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,907
<i>It's definitely that TV show's fault!</i>

88
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:33,203
{\an8}MONSTER SWEEPER INC.

89
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:37,791
Good morning.

90
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:40,919
Kafka's here! Come this way!

91
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,006
-I'm going to start getting ready!
-All right.

92
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,924
-Morning, Kafka.
-Hey.

93
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,345
This is Ichikawa-kun. He'll work
with us part-time, starting today.

94
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,931
{\an8}His dream is to join the Defense Force!

95
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,311
That was his dream too, you know?

96
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,856
He's already given up,
and he's a veteran here!

97
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,858
<i>This is the worst!</i>

98
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:04,276
Toku-san,

99
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:07,070
-how's he supposed to react to that?
-Why…

100
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,116
Why did you give up?

101
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:19,166
I tried my best, you know?

102
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,627
But there are so many talented people.

103
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:25,631
I hit a wall to my potential.

104
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:28,759
-You'll understand when you're older--
-I won't.

105
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:34,014
I'll never give up.
I'll never understand until the day I die.

106
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,391
Not that I want to.

107
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,102
-Hey, where are you--
-I'm getting changed.

108
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,064
Geez.

109
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,442
I thought you two would get along well.

110
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:47,027
<i>That's unfair!</i>

111
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,198
<i>No matter how I respond to that,</i>
<i>I'd be a pathetic loser!</i>

112
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:55,661
<i>Is it such a bad thing to give up?</i>

113
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:02,251
All right, let's start.

114
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,337
Team Miike, continue cleaning the bones.

115
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,880
Keep everything intact

116
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,465
-and send it over to Izumo Tech.
-Yes, sir!

117
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:11,969
Team Yoshimura will dismantle the legs.
Everything will be discarded.

118
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,303
Yes, sir.

119
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,180
The newbies get the intestines.
Come with me.

120
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:16,098
Yes, sir.

121
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,183
<i>All right! Serves you right!</i>

122
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:21,061
-Kafka, you're intestines, too.
-Me too?

123
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:25,315
-This is my second day in a row!
-You're good at it though.

124
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:29,319
Dammit, bring it on!

125
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:34,032
He always stands up
to the challenge in the end.

126
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,787
If he had passed, he would've been
a great Defense Force member.

127
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,001
Seriously?

128
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:49,131
<i>He's suffering big time!</i>

129
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,802
<i>Same goes for me.</i>

130
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:59,683
Hey, is that all you brought to eat?

131
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,060
I don't think I can eat this.

132
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:04,146
I'm sure.

133
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:07,149
-Here.
-What is it--

134
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,151
Ow!

135
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,155
{\an8}That's for you.
Eat whatever you're able to.

136
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,948
You have to get through the day.

137
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:17,993
-I'll be fine--
-I'll give you these also.

138
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,786
These make it much more tolerable.

139
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,040
I don't know what you're saying,

140
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,042
but I seriously don't need those--

141
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,503
Don't be shy. Just put them on.

142
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,631
Senpai, that's workplace harassment!

143
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,008
This is a rite of passage for all newbies.

144
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,820
Carry your own stuff, okay?

145
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,406
-Good work today!
-Good work!

146
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,911
-See you!
-Good work today.

147
00:11:03,497 --> 00:11:07,000
We got through the smelliest areas.

148
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,718
Senpai.

149
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,513
Hey, Ichikawa.

150
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:23,517
Are you here to get back at me for lunch?

151
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:25,685
Thanks to you…

152
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,188
Thanks to you, I survived my first day.

153
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,192
Thank you, sir.

154
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,949
That's all.

155
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:41,159
Goodbye.

156
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:49,126
Also, they're raising the age limit
to under 33.

157
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,378
To join the Defense Force.

158
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,465
Because of the low birthrates.

159
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,177
It's your life,
so, it's none of my business,

160
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,764
but when you said you gave up,

161
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,059
you looked really sad, that's all.

162
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,188
It seriously doesn't matter to me.

163
00:12:10,272 --> 00:12:14,317
If I got it all wrong, you're free
to give up all you want.

164
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,402
Bye!

165
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:17,946
Ichikawa.

166
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,033
Thanks.

167
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:25,287
You're nicer than you look.

168
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:28,373
I told you that's not what this is about!

169
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,425
Senpai?

170
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,267
<i>Yoju?</i>

171
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,524
Run, Ichikawa! Get as far away as you can!

172
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,861
Once you're in a safe area, make a report.

173
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,780
-But senpai, you'd be alone--
-Having two won't make a difference!

174
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,200
You're joining the Force, right?

175
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,453
Don't die here!

176
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,175
Here! I'm over here!

177
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,454
<i>Over there!</i>

178
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:58,421
<i>I did it.</i>

179
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,257
<i>Now, I can…</i>

180
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:06,304
Goddammit!

181
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:27,367
It's all gone.
Your home, my home, our school.

182
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,162
I won't forgive kaiju!

183
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,790
I was almost done
with all the GlaMon stages!

184
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,167
That's why you're sad?

185
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,054
I'm sad that Meeko died.

186
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,017
Meeko's your calico cat, right?

187
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,369
-I'm going to join the Defense Force.
-I'm going to join the Defense Force.

188
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,916
Hey, you're just a kid!

189
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,168
You're still in elementary school too,
Kafka-kun!

190
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,884
In that case,

191
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,387
let's bet on who becomes
the coolest Defense Force officer!

192
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,641
Let's defeat all the kaiju together!

193
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,646
<i>Shit. It wasn't supposed to be like this!</i>

194
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,611
<i>Shit!</i>

195
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,575
<i>Kaiju don't scare me!</i>

196
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:57,248
<i>Aim for the leg. The leg…</i>

197
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:04,881
<i>How did I get here?</i>

198
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:08,301
Let's bet on who becomes
the coolest officer!

199
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:39,624
Ichikawa?

200
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,046
-You idiot! Why--
-I made the report!

201
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,340
That's not what I'm talking about!

202
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,595
If I leave you here and run,

203
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:57,183
I'd never become a Defense Force officer!

204
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,561
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU…

205
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:03,231
<i>Shit.</i>

206
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,483
TOTSUKA CONSTRUCTION

207
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,527
<i>Shit.</i>

208
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:10,780
<i>Shit!</i>

209
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,492
<i>Why am I so weak?</i>

210
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,619
<i>I haven't grown at all.</i>

211
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:20,498
<i>I can't even protect my own video game,</i>
<i>a friend's cat,</i>

212
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:23,460
<i>even my own kohai!</i>

213
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,797
Shit!

214
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,982
Target defeated.
I see an injured civilian.

215
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,069
Rescue operation will continue.

216
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,114
{\an8}Igarashi, Takaragi,
look after the injured.

217
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,032
{\an8}JAPAN DEFENSE FORCE THIRD DIVISION

218
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,326
Everyone else, follow me.

219
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,286
We'll look for any remaining yoju.

220
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:07,045
-Are you all right?
-Don't move. Stay still.

221
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,076
<i>Mina is so cool.</i>

222
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,871
<i>She crushed that frightening monster</i>
<i>with one blow.</i>

223
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,169
<i>She's somewhere far away from me now.</i>

224
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,005
Senpai.

225
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,595
After the kaiju appeared

226
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:00,181
and you told me to run,

227
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,977
if you didn't save me then,

228
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:07,272
I would've died today.

229
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,817
You were really cool.

230
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,614
Let's bet on who becomes
the coolest Defense Force officer!

231
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,661
I really think you should be
a Defense Force officer.

232
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,709
Well, it's your life, so it doesn't
matter to me.

233
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:31,838
You're right.

234
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:37,343
<i>When will I stop looking away</i>
<i>from what's important!?</i>

235
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,848
Thanks, Ichikawa.

236
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:46,352
You're a really good guy.

237
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,814
I don't think it's a bad thing to give up,

238
00:19:51,441 --> 00:19:54,027
but it's bad to lie to yourself!

239
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,947
I'm going to try joining
the Defense Force again--

240
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,291
What?

241
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,877
I found you.

242
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:13,671
Kai… Kai…

243
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:16,966
Senpai?

244
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,889
Does your injury hurt?

245
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,643
Senpai!

246
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,369
What?

247
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,955
-What?
-Ichikawa, it's me!

248
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,916
Don't get so scared!

249
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,214
OH…

250
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,590
He's reporting you.

251
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,467
Let's run, senpai!

252
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,679
What?

253
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,770
{\an8}ORIGINAL WORK BY: NAOYA MATSUMOTO

254
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,195
When you encounter a kaiju,

255
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,447
you should attack its legs,

256
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,117
tie it up, and make sure it can't move.

257
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,120
It's a little scary.

258
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,747
What is?

259
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:57,627
Imagining what it's like to fight a kaiju
that's so much bigger than you.

260
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:03,549
It'll be okay.

261
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,053
Anytime that happens,

262
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,432
I'll be right next to you!

263
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:17,021
Liar.

264
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,694
Yes.

265
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,615
A kaiju appeared
at South Yokohama Hospital?

266
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:29,742
Yes.

267
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:33,955
No, there's no problem.

268
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,749
I'll dispatch my officers right away.

269
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,751
Yes, we'll kill it.
