1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:02,837
<i>Previously on</i> Kaiju No. 8.

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:05,923
What is that? What the hell is going on?

3
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:09,427
The dead kaiju are reacting.
They're coming back to life.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,138
You did well, Kikoru!

5
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,474
I don't have time right now.
I'll clean you up…

6
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,352
in one blow!

7
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:25,359
<i>Despite the unexpected incident,</i>
<i>Senpai's final exam came to an end.</i>

8
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,112
It's all because you pushed me
to keep going.

9
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:30,406
Thanks, Ichikawa.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,825
<i>After overcoming this challenge,</i>

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:36,579
<i>Senpai seemed even more reliable</i>
<i>than before.</i>

12
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,168
I can't!

13
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,544
<i>Nope. Never mind.</i>

14
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,006
It's too scary! Way too scary!

15
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,300
It's your fault!

16
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,385
It's your fault for pushing me!

17
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,304
That's why I'm so afraid now!

18
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,473
You thanked me at the hospital!

19
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,267
What happened to that wise,
philosophical Senpai?

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,311
Kafka, Ichikawa!

21
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:04,315
These letters arrived for you.

22
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,077
ORIGINAL WORK BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

23
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:40,327
{\an8}NEUTRALIZATION BUREAU

24
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,330
All right. Let's open on three.

25
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,586
<i>There's no way around this.</i>
<i>This is my last chance.</i>

26
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,464
<i>Will my path lead to me</i>
<i>standing next to her?</i>

27
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,091
<i>Now's the time to know!</i>

28
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,595
One, two…

29
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,847
{\an8}DEAR KAFKA HIBINO
SELECTION RESULTS

30
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:14,486
Hey. I knew you had passed.

31
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,988
Same to you.

32
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,949
Most of the people are just as I expected.

33
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,702
Shinomiya's stalker fan isn't here.

34
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,830
-Did you want him to pass?
-No, I thought…

35
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,165
It's Shinomiya!

36
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,006
Shinomiya-san! I heard you earned
the top score!

37
00:03:34,089 --> 00:03:36,008
Yup. They asked me to do the oath.

38
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,385
-Excited to work with you!
-Same here.

39
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:42,056
Before the application process,
I thought I'd get the top score.

40
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,516
But after all that she did, it's obvious.

41
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:47,853
Let's fight for the Number Two position,
shall we?

42
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:50,522
I was first in the physical fitness score.

43
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,319
You aim for Number Two,
I'll aim for the top.

44
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,951
Oh, sorry. Hey, I know you.

45
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,411
You're that old man's partner.

46
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,038
I'm Reno Ichikawa.

47
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,833
Sorry. I'm bad at remembering names.

48
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,001
I'm Iharu Furuhashi.

49
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:14,004
Nice to meet you, Furuhashi-san.

50
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:17,424
Just call me Iharu, Reno!

51
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,343
All right, then.

52
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,514
Where's the old man? He didn't make it?

53
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:25,391
Well, Senpai…

54
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,061
Captain Mina Ashiro is entering!

55
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,115
<i>Captain Ashiro.</i>

56
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:43,659
<i>She's finally here!</i>

57
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,421
The ceremony will commence.

58
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,591
Top accepted applicant, Kikoru Shinomiya.

59
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:00,884
Yes!

60
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:15,107
Starting today, the 27 of you

61
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,484
will be appointed
as Defense Force officers.

62
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,993
As the representative
of the 27 new members,

63
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,620
I swear on my life to fight
for the Defense Force!

64
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,166
You helped us greatly with the incident
after the exams.

65
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:35,044
Thanks to you, there were no victims.

66
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,463
I thank you once again.

67
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,677
<i>I didn't defeat the kaiju.</i>

68
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,846
<i>Kafka Hibino,</i>

69
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,682
<i>you should be receiving</i>
<i>these words right now.</i>

70
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,642
<i>Why aren't you here?</i>

71
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,189
<i>Not only did he save me,</i>
<i>but he expressed concern for me,</i>

72
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:57,441
<i>as if he was above me.</i>

73
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:00,194
I'm glad you're okay!

74
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,154
<i>How humiliating!</i>

75
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,032
<i>I need to interrogate him</i>
<i>about his kaiju form.</i>

76
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:08,035
<i>I won't forgive him</i>
<i>if I never see him again.</i>

77
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,329
Excuse me?

78
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:13,040
Sorry for coming in
during the middle of the ceremony.

79
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,417
What's going on?

80
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,627
Old man?

81
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:23,383
Number 2032, Kafka Hibino,
will be rejected.

82
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,552
He's on the lowest rank
for physical fitness,

83
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:28,764
and his suit compatibility
is currently zero. It can't be helped.

84
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,016
Yeah, that's what I figured.

85
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:38,107
-So, no objections?
-I'll object.

86
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,819
It's true that his performance
was below average.

87
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,779
He should be rejected as an officer.

88
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:48,700
But he was able to find the enemy's
weak points during the final test,

89
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:51,620
prioritized supporting others rather
than his own score,

90
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,122
and contributed greatly.

91
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,541
That's not something anyone can do.

92
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,959
And finally,

93
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,337
he made a great contribution
as the team's comedian.

94
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,713
I knew it!

95
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,134
I don't know if he could get promoted
as an officer yet,

96
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,512
but I'll train him as a cadet
in my platoon.

97
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:14,184
{\an8}He will be joining the Force as a cadet,

98
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,520
{\an8}so he was not part
of the officer swearing-in.

99
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,106
<i>That's more like it, Kafka Hibino.</i>

100
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,442
<i>I knew he had passed.</i>

101
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,736
-<i>Even though he's a cadet.</i>
-<i>That was unexpected.</i>

102
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,244
Now that everyone's here,

103
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,121
Captain Ashiro will say a few words.

104
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,960
Hello, all. First of all, I'm very happy
that you applied to the Defense Force,

105
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:44,339
stuck through the difficult application
process, and passed.

106
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:45,424
I thank you all.

107
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,386
Recently, the number of kaiju appearances

108
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,721
and their fortitudes

109
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,891
have both increased much higher
than the historical average.

110
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:57,895
There was also the mysterious incident
of dead kaiju coming back to life.

111
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:02,024
You will experience many dangerous
and life-threatening neutralizations.

112
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,194
Some may die on their first mission.

113
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,280
We cannot guarantee your life
in the slightest.

114
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,201
But even then,
or perhaps because of those reasons,

115
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,454
we want you to entrust your life with us.

116
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:21,293
I promise to be at the front line,
becoming your shield

117
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,754
and your spear.

118
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:30,886
And I'll stand next to you in no time,
Mina!

119
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:31,845
WHAT!?

120
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:32,804
HUH!?

121
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,306
CHILLY AIR

122
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,808
-What's wrong with him?
-He's insane!

123
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:38,810
He called Captain Ashiro
by her first name!

124
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,730
OOPS

125
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,482
Kaf…

126
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,946
Kafka Hibino. Speaking without permission.
Addressing a superior by first name.

127
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,114
Hundred pushups in total.

128
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,868
<i>Shit, I didn't mean to say that out loud!</i>

129
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:58,413
On his first day, too!

130
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:02,668
You're being too lenient, Captain Ashiro.

131
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,423
<i>Was she smiling just now?</i>

132
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:12,386
Looks like Vice-Captain's hired comedian
is already at work.

133
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,472
Right? I knew he had potential!

134
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,724
This job can get dark.

135
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,768
I think guys like that are important.

136
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,813
<i>Though that's only half the truth.</i>

137
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,732
<i>During the kaiju resurrections,</i>

138
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,486
<i>a fortitude 9.8 reading suddenly appeared.</i>

139
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:34,783
<i>It's probably an error, but someone's</i>
<i>vitals disappeared at the same time.</i>

140
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:39,663
<i>Kafka Hibino. Along with his abnormally</i>
<i>low compatibility with the suit,</i>

141
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,873
<i>there are a lot of strange things</i>
<i>about him.</i>

142
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:46,378
<i>I'll keep him close to him to figure out</i>
<i>what this strangeness is.</i>

143
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,339
Ninety-nine… 100!

144
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,761
You did well, old man!

145
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,264
Kafka Hibino.

146
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:00,434
Come. I need to talk to you.

147
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:02,769
What is it? We can't talk here?

148
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:06,023
-Not here.
-Is it a confession of love?

149
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,441
No, it isn't!

150
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,110
-Senpai.
-I know what this is.

151
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,945
She's challenging me to a duel.

152
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,655
Just come already!

153
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,703
What?

154
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,581
You ate a kaiju and became one yourself?

155
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,375
I can't believe it! You were that hungry?

156
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:28,587
-I didn't eat it on purpose!
-Both of you, keep your voices down.

157
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,133
Maybe I should just tell
the Defense Force.

158
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,052
Maybe they could cure me.

159
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,095
-That's impossible.
-What?

160
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,514
Even if they don't kill you,

161
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,267
they'd do tests and experiments
on you nonstop.

162
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:44,895
You'll never have a future
as a Defense Officer.

163
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,521
Really?

164
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,734
Also, kaiju that are strong enough
to be assigned a number

165
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:54,529
are used as parts for a special weapon
after they're taken down.

166
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,240
Worst case scenario,
that'll happen to you.

167
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,784
Please, Kikoru!

168
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,620
Please keep this a secret between us!

169
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,997
Please save this old man's life!

170
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:06,083
-You're too close!
-Please, please!

171
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:10,587
Fine. You did save me.

172
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:12,547
I'll keep it quiet for now.

173
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,757
However,

174
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:18,512
if I ever find out
that you're a danger to humans,

175
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:21,056
I'll kill you.

176
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:26,770
Yeah.

177
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,898
I'm counting on you if that time comes.

00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:18,530
<i>Growing this much in such</i>
<i>a short amount of time is incredible.</i>

189
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,367
<i>That Reno, he improved his score again!</i>

190
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,287
Bring it on!

191
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,792

All right!

195
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,725
I won, Reno! Don't underestimate me!

196
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,685
I never did.

Get along, you two. Even adding
both of your scores doesn't reach mine.

200
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,784
Jesus.

201
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:08,705
The more she improves,
the more I realize how mediocre I am.

202
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,790
Don't get distracted
by her too much, Haruichi.

203
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,627
I've caught up to you in combat power.

All right!

210
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:42,572
You see that, Kikoru?
I finally turned my zero into a one!

211
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,032
-Don't come near me!
-Look!

212
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:44,950
Praise me!

213
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,662
Why are you bragging about your 1%?
I'm at 55!

214
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,081
-Kafka!
-Yes, Vice Captain Hoshino!

215
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,167
Keep this up and you'd never
get promoted as an officer.

216
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:56,795
-You'll be fired in three months!
-What?

217
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,255
Old man.

218
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,759
All right, run ten laps,
and then we're done for the day!

219
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,927
What?

220
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,429
You complained, so now, it's 15 laps.

221
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,682
-Go on!
-Roger!

222
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,269
Looks like the newbies
are pretty competitive.

223
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:15,188
Apparently, they're competing
and trying to improve,

224
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:17,732
even when I'm not around.

225
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:22,863
I'm so tired!

226
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,658
Making us run laps in the end?

227
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,577
That Vice Captain is a demon.

228
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,496
Your muscles
are still underdeveloped, Reno!

229
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,000
Yours are about the same as mine.

230
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,043
Our physical tests are similar, too.

231
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:41,172
What? You're blind!
Look closer at my biceps!

232
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,174
They're just swollen for no reason.

233
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,927
Seems like Reno is competitive.
I didn't expect that.

234
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,098
Don't be fighting
over such stupid nonsense!

235
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,852
Maybe these adult muscles
with real labor experience

236
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,103
will shut you up!

237
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,565
Wow! You're looking better, old man.

238
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,817
SIGH, BOING!

239
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,320
Oh no, so close!

240
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,655
That belly is unacceptable
in the Defense Force!

241
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,074
Don't be rude, Iharu-kun.

242
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:12,120
You assholes! Be prepared
for when you're over 28!

243
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,830
It's getting better, okay?

244
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:17,167
Don't look at my belly. Let's arm wrestle!

245
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,836
-Bring it on, old man!
-Challenge accepted.

246
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,339
Lay down a towel here, and…

247
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,799
What's going on?
It's louder than usual in here.

248
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,266
What's wrong?

249
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,394
We're just a bunch of scrawny boys.

250
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,563
As expected
of a former Self-Defense officer.

251
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,613
Muscles aren't important, right, Reno?

252
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,325
<i>This atmosphere brings me back.</i>

253
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,078
-Let's compete at tomorrow's training.
-I won't lose!

254
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,081
FRUITS MILK

255
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,126
-Just as expected.
-Right.

256
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,587
Excuse us, ma'am!

257
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,966
It's all right. I'm almost done here.

258
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,051
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you, ma'am.

259
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:11,096
-Wow, I talked to her!
-She's so cool.

260
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,431
Is your recovery going well?

261
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,518
Yes, thanks to everyone's help.

262
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,357
<i>Just as I thought.</i>
<i>She has well-balanced, trimmed muscles.</i>

263
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,194
<i>But that alone won't explain</i>
<i>her overwhelming combat powers.</i>

264
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,489
-What is it?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

265
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,449
I was wondering how you get those muscles.

266
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:35,328
I was wondering
what your training routine was.

267
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,247
Come next to me.

268
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,708
I'll teach you the basics.

269
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,960
Here?

270
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:47,924
Yes, please, ma'am!

271
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,352
Hey, why did everyone
join the Defense Force, anyways?

272
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,898
If you want to know,
you should tell us first.

273
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:07,944
My answer is simple.
Because of Captain Ashiro.

274
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,323
<i>Ever since she saved me in middle school,</i>

275
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,868
<i>she's always been my idol!</i>

276
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,665
And you guys?

277
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,294
My family definitely influenced
my decision, but I'm the same.

278
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:27,589
-I want to be like Captain Ashiro.
-Same here.

279
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,092
Captain Ashiro's poster was so cool.

280
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:33,595
That recent documentary was amazing, too.

281
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,973
Mina is really influential, huh?

282
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:39,559
She's the super hero of our generation.

283
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:42,479
-And you, old man?
-Huh?

284
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,607
Well, as for me…

285
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,609
What?

286
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:51,196
-Captain Ashiro is…
-Your childhood friend?

287
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,572
Well, yeah.

288
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,950
And you promised to be officers together?

289
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,078
A moving childhood memory?

290
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,540
-I'll see you guys later.
-Wait.

291
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,714
Tell us everything, all right?

292
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,843
Well, the day Mina was born
was a bright and sunny day.

293
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,346
-Okay.
-She always loved dried squid.

294
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,808
-That's surprising.
-She raised the class pets in school.

295
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,811
-Give us more!
-Well, and then…

296
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,354
WOMEN

297
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,314
That was a nice bath!

298
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,361
Was there a mass murder here?

299
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,238
Hey, Kikorun.

300
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:35,657
They talked for too long in the bath
and got heatstroke.

301
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,828
They were talking about Captain Ashiro.

302
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,497
Boys are so stupid!

303
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,520
<i>I don't have much time.</i>
<i>I have to work twice as hard.</i>

304
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:33,358
-You're hard at work, I see.
-Huh?

305
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,861
-Vice Captain Hoshino!
-Sleeping's part of the job.

306
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,951
I can't get fired from here.

307
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,495
For Captain Ashiro?

308
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,704
How did you know that?

309
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,915
You said so yourself, in the bath.

310
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,628
No conversation
held in this dormitory is kept a secret.

311
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,921
So scary!

312
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:58,049
I promised

313
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,551
to fight alongside her one day.

314
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:06,182
I see. That sounds like you want to rob
my position of Vice Captain from me.

315
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:08,309
That's not what I meant.

316
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:10,979
No.

317
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,482
I'll work hard with that goal in mind.

318
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,860
Bring it on.

319
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,654
Two hours. That's the max.

320
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,783
When leaving the room,
turn off the lights and lock the door.

321
00:21:26,995 --> 00:21:29,747
I won't give up my position
next to Captain Ashiro.

322
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,127
-Thank you.
-Also.

323
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,298
Be careful about being too friendly
with the other officers.

324
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:43,928
In this job, you don't know
what will happen to who.

325
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,184
Kaiju?

326
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:53,938
This isn't a drill, right?

327
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,694
Speak of the devil.

328
00:22:01,738 --> 00:22:04,407
Let's go. It's your first mission.

329
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:39,919
