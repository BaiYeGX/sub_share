1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:01,961
Kaiju No. 8.

2
00:00:02,712 --> 00:00:06,716
To think that a kaiju had snuck
into the Defense Force!

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,093
And a Daikaiju class at that.

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,429
We must deal with this right away.

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,723
Will we be releasing this to the press?

6
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:17,226
We should avoid it, as we did with No. 9.

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:22,273
Some countries have begun transplanting
kaiju tissues on human bodies.

8
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,774
They would cause a big fuss.

9
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:28,529
We must exterminate it quietly
and use the materials for weapons.

10
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:29,739
Before that,

11
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:32,825
should we not consider using it
as a living weapon?

12
00:00:32,908 --> 00:00:35,119
There's no use debating hypotheticals.

13
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:37,830
First, we must contain the kaiju.

14
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,374
I order the Third Division

15
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,961
to hand over Kaiju No. 8 straight away.

16
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:52,136
ORIGINAL WORK BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

17
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:26,647
Kaiju No. 8's vitals have stabilized.
No signs of transformation.

18
00:02:27,565 --> 00:02:29,191
It's really him?

19
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,033
<i>It's been about 24 hours.</i>

20
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,038
<i>What's going to happen to me now?</i>

21
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:45,958
Kaiju that are strong enough
to be assigned a number

22
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,920
are used as parts for a special weapon
after they're taken down.

23
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:52,882
Worst case scenario,
that'll happen to you.

24
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,848
<i>After getting one step closer</i>
<i>to fighting by her side!</i>

25
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,894
Mina must be pissed at me.

26
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:10,274
It's time.

27
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:13,277
We will be transferring you
to headquarters now.

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,486
Mi…

29
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,035
-Vice-Captain! I'm sorry, I--
-Don't talk.

30
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,621
Stand up.

31
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,969
<i>Of course, they're pissed.</i>

32
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,556
<i>I kept this big secret from them.</i>

33
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:09,166
The security troops accompanying you
are all ready.

34
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,885
<i>Shit. I can't look him in the face.</i>

35
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,180
<i>He was always worried about me.</i>

36
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,015
<i>I'm certain he can't forgive me.</i>

37
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,601
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

38
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:38,529
-<i>Now, it's really over.</i>
-Senpai!

39
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,992
I know you'll be back. I believe it.

40
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,372
Ichikawa.

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,004
That Ichikawa. He'll be getting 50 pushups
for talking without permission.

42
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,338
Mina?

43
00:04:56,422 --> 00:04:58,882
We're not under any surveillance here.

44
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:03,429
When you ran over to save everyone
without hesitation,

45
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:07,308
your kaiju form surprised me,
but I also thought,

46
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,935
"This is the Kafka-kun I know."

47
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:16,108
We're collecting witness accounts
and footage to help you right now.

48
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,319
If we can prove that you're human,

49
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:20,696
we might be able to avoid extermination.

50
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:24,783
Your performance as an officer
will be included in the report.

51
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:29,288
There's no one in the Third Division
who thinks

52
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,332
that you're an enemy.

53
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,460
It's time.

54
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,170
Sit down.

55
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:42,718
Kafka Hibino. According to Regulation 13
of the Defense Force,

56
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:46,221
you will be transferred
to the Ariake Rinkai Base.

57
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,557
-If civilians are put at risk--
-Mina.

58
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,061
Can I still

59
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:56,690
keep working towards fighting
by your side?

60
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:12,122
Yeah. I'll wait for you.

61
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:36,563
That idiot.

62
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,817
Third Division, salute!

63
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,703
What is this, Vice-Captain Hoshina?

64
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:55,082
We are saluting our superior,
Captain Ashiro.

65
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,462
Of course, you are.
You must never salute a kaiju.

66
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:03,340
Yes, sir.

67
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,845
{\an8}DEFENSE FORCE RINKAI BASE

68
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,561
<i>Barrier Number 31, this is Number 23.</i>

69
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,020
<i>Lock is functioning properly.</i>

70
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,898
<i>Kaiju No. 8 has been restrained.</i>

71
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,654
{\an8}FEW DAYS LATER

72
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,592
I still can't believe it.

73
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:49,887
I never thought Old Man was Kaiju No. 8!

74
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,098
That squishy-bellied old man!

75
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,142
Right, Reno?

76
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:04,109
Hibino-san

77
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,362
saved me from a kaiju.

78
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,324
He would always find kaiju's weak spots

79
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,868
and was always cheerful
during training, too.

80
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:16,455
Yeah, I know. Old Man helped me too.

81
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,457
It's not for us to decide.

82
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,459
It's the Neutralization Bureau.

83
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,796
As expected from a former SDF officer.
It's a system of hierarchy, huh?

84
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,715
But that's how it is.

85
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,802
It's a serious thing for a human
to turn into a kaiju.

86
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,764
If this gets out to the public,

87
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,724
the whole world will go into a panic.

88
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:40,354
We'll live our lives constantly afraid
that the person next to us

89
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,232
could be a kaiju.

90
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,234
No.

91
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,693
The issue is bigger

92
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:50,489
than anything we ever have influence over.

93
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,033
<i>Senpai.</i>

94
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,411
Come in.

95
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,497
Excuse me.

96
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,000
Did you call for me?

97
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:05,712
Can you put those reports together?
I'm in a bit of a rush.

98
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,507
Yes, ma'am. This is…

99
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,636
-Can I count on you?
-Yes, ma'am.

100
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,476
Vice-Captain!

101
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,105
We've finished removing
all of the scrapped cars.

102
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:25,482
Thanks. Good work.

103
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:32,447
What do you think will happen to Hibino?

104
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,373
He's got to come back.

105
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,795
You know, when he fought me,
he went easy on me.

106
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,171
Treating me like I'm weak or something.

107
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:50,382
I agree, sir.

108
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,885
Next time, he's fighting me
with all he's got.

109
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:58,390
DIRECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE

110
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:04,771
Come in.

111
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:11,612
What is it?

112
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,580
Director General Shinomiya.

113
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,541
I'm here to request Kafka Hibino's
extermination to be canceled.

114
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:28,378
He's saved my life as well.

115
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,132
-Please have mercy on him….
-You fool.

116
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,927
You've come to talk
about this stupid failure?

117
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,638
But…

118
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,766
{\an8}Look at this.

119
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,559
Yes, sir.

120
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:49,024
This is an X-ray scan of his chest.

121
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,276
The thing on his left chest.

122
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,821
It looks very similar to a heart,
but it's a core.

123
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,158
No.

124
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,661
He's not human.

125
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,663
He's a kaiju.

126
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:07,668
Just like the kaiju
that killed your mother.

127
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,128
You heard me. Now get out.

128
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:30,524
Dad.

129
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:35,278
Even so, I want to believe in him.

130
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:44,913
Another physical exam?
How long are we going to do this?

131
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,332
I'd love to sleep in a real bed soon.

132
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,425
I know you'll be back. I believe it.

133
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,511
<i>I have</i>

134
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:03,223
<i>a lot of things I need to say</i>
<i>to everybody.</i>

135
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,392
<i>I'll never give up.</i>

136
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,436
<i>I need to go back to that place</i>

137
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,021
<i>one more time.</i>

138
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:11,857
CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

139
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,400
We're being transferred?

140
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,527
It's just a temporary measure.

141
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,405
Due to the recent kaiju attacks,

142
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:22,075
the Tachikawa Base
has lost 75% of its function.

143
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:27,622
<i>It was decided that it cannot function</i>
<i>as a facility to train new officers.</i>

144
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:33,170
<i>We've had No. 9 and No. 10 appear</i>
<i>one after another.</i>

145
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:37,007
Higher ups are worried about
what this might mean.

146
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,469
They think it could be a series
of Swarm Disasters.

147
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,263
So, we're going to keep getting
more of these attacks?

148
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:47,517
Not only that. Multiple attacks
could happen simultaneously.

149
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,063
We have to be prepared.

150
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,524
The key is you all.

151
00:12:56,818 --> 00:13:00,071
We'll be training the exceptionally
talented new officers

152
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,365
across Division borders.

153
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,702
-That's why we're being transferred?
-You hear that? We're exceptional!

154
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,412
Is it because of No. 8?

155
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:09,372
What do you mean?

156
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,417
Could our superiors be planning
to split up the officers

157
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,504
who were the closest to Kafka Hibino
to monitor us?

158
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,006
Captain Ashiro.

159
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,009
-If that's the case, then I won't follow.
-Wait.

160
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,930
It's beautiful that you care
about your fellow officer this way.

161
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:28,642
But this plan had been in the works
for a long time.

162
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,644
It has nothing to do with Kafka Hibino.

163
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,021
I understand.

164
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,566
But to be transferred to another
division so suddenly…

165
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,653
That's right. I joined because I looked up
to the Third Division.

166
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,404
To you!

167
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:42,948
I'll do it.

168
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,701
Did you hear what she said?
We're getting split up!

169
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,205
-You should think before answering.
-I'll do it.

170
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,006
DAD

171
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,593
Yes.

172
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,305
It's about inside the Defense Force,
so I can't speak on the details.

173
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:10,600
But there's a man I really want to save.

174
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,979
Yes. I know it's near impossible.

175
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,439
Thank you, sir.

176
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,946
Sorry. I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

177
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,116
I came up here on my own.
Don't worry about it.

178
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,203
Aoi.

179
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,758
I was talking to my former superior
in the SDF.

180
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:49,264
I asked him to connect me to someone
who could influence Kafka's punishment.

181
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,057
I didn't expect you

182
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,102
to go around making personal requests
like that.

183
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:58,857
I told you, didn't I?
I don't want to lose anyone.

184
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:03,778
Kafka Hibino is a member
of the Third Division,

185
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,280
isn't he?

186
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,283
I…

187
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:17,834
<i>If we can prove that you're human,</i>
<i>we might be able to avoid extermination.</i>

188
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,837
<i>Just like Mina said.</i>

189
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,425
<i>I'll prove that I'm human,</i>
<i>and I'll go back to the Third Division.</i>

190
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,011
<i>First, I have to make them listen to me.</i>

191
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,567
Director General Shinomiya?

192
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,616
I didn't think the Director General
would go himself.

193
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,787
The more important something is,
the more he wants to deal with it himself.

194
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,372
That's the kind of man he is.

195
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:57,916
Director General!

196
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,752
I'm not a kaiju!

197
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,631
Release his restraints.

198
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:11,721
But that man is Kaiju No. 8.
It's too risky!

199
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,556
Who do you think you're talking to?

200
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,353
If he's really Daikaiju class,

201
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,855
he'd be able to break these easily.

202
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,859
If he's sitting there without resisting,
he's doing so at his will.

203
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:30,782
<i>Maybe this man would listen to me.</i>

204
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,578
Director General Shinomiya. I'm a human.

205
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,000
Kafka Hibino!

206
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,629
<i>What was that?</i>

207
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,971
Let me tell you something.

208
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,933
If a creature can block a bullet
with his bare skin,

209
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:01,312
in this world, we don't call those humans,

210
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:03,106
Kaiju No. 8.

211
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,649
Dad.

212
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,574
I'm not Kaiju No. 8.

213
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,327
I'm Kafka Hibino.

214
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,705
I see.

215
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:20,874
That's the sign.

216
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:25,211
FS-1002 has been unlocked.
Permission to use has been granted.

217
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:35,472
What is that?

218
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,477
Nerve link is clear.

219
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,898
The driver and syncing
with Kaiju No. 2 cells, all clear.

220
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,400
FS-1002 start-up is complete.

221
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:57,202
In that case, die in that form.

222
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,914
We'll begin with the extermination
of Kaiju No. 8.

223
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:05,835
<i>I won't transform all the way.</i>
<i>I'll prove that I'm human.</i>

224
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,644
Kafka!

225
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,437
He hasn't changed.

226
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,439
The man

227
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:30,693
who was once called the strongest
in Defense Force history.

228
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,075
You're looking more like a kaiju now.

229
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:53,299
<i>I can't take that attack directly.</i>
<i>I have to keep dodging him</i>

230
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:55,009
<i>until he's at his drive limit!</i>

231
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:30,170
<i>Why is my body reacting this way?</i>

232
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,381
<i>It's the same feeling I felt</i>
<i>when I faced a Daikaiju.</i>

233
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,842
<i>But who I'm facing right now is…</i>

234
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:40,054
<i>Could it be, I'm sensing a Daikaiju</i>
<i>from the Director General?</i>

235
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,184
Kaiju No. 2.

236
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:49,314
A kaiju that almost drove Sapporo
to total annihilation back in 1972.

237
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:52,692
<i>It's the second kaiju</i>
<i>to be assigned a designated number.</i>

238
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,944
<i>He was a Daikaiju</i>
<i>with an immense destructive force</i>

239
00:19:55,028 --> 00:20:00,575
<i>and so much pride that he did not</i>
<i>give up until his very last breath.</i>

240
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:06,706
We made a suit and arm based on No. 2.

241
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:10,460
And the only man who could wear that
was your father,

242
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,545
Isao Shinomiya.

243
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:18,301
<i>So, this is what Kikoru was talking about!</i>

244
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,388
<i>The Identified Kaiju Weapons, Numbers!</i>

245
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:28,102
<i>No. I can't take these attacks any more.</i>

246
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,395
<i>Dodge them!</i>

247
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,857
<i>What? I can't move!</i>

248
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,569
<i>When did that happen?</i>

249
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,782
<i>Shit.</i>

250
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,828
Kafka Hibino!

251
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,336
Thank God.

252
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,091
I finally meet you in your true form,
kaiju.

253
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,137
<i>Huh? Something's wrong.</i>

254
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,526
<i>I knew it. Something weird is happening.</i>

255
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:24,367
What's going on?
My body's not listening to me.

256
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:37,547
<i>Shit. I'm trying to prove to them</i>
<i>that I'm human,</i>

257
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,966
<i>but I'm becoming more and more</i>
<i>like a kaiju.</i>

258
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,470
<i>Kill…</i>

259
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:49,225
<i>Kill all kaiju. Kill…</i>

260
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:06,492
Stop it! You're human, Kafka Hibino!

261
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,961
