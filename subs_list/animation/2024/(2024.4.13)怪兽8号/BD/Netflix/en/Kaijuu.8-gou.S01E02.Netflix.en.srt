1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,423
When the kaiju appeared
and you told me to run,

2
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:09,135
if you didn't save me then,

3
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,721
I would've died today.

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,976
I really think you should be
a Defense Force officer.

5
00:00:22,648 --> 00:00:24,817
Thanks, Ichikawa.

6
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:27,945
I knew it. You're a really good guy.

7
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,365
I'm going to try joining
the Defense Force again--

8
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,038
<i>I found you.</i>

9
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:38,831
Kai… Kai…

10
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,208
Senpai!

ORIGINAL SERIES BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

"It'll be okay.

13
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,893
Anytime that happens,
I'll be right next to you!"

14
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,773
Wow, Kafka-kun! You read too much manga!

15
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,275
That was so corny!

16
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:31,110
You bastard!

17
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:34,196
Don't say a word about this
to our moms, all right?

18
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,907
Those two are always oversharing
with the other moms.

19
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,664
Thanks.

20
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,502
It's not so scary when it's the two of us.

21
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:00,890
The kaiju was discovered in the hospital.

22
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,642
We must prevent any human casualties.

23
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,188
We'll defeat this kaiju at all costs.

24
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:13,611
{\an8}<i>A small kaiju has appeared in Yokohama.</i>

25
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,195
{\an8}<i>I repeat.</i>

26
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:16,989
<i>A small kaiju has appeared in Yokohama.</i>

27
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,617
This alert is so annoying!

28
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,620
-Why can't the government change it?
-Hurry, Sho-chan!

29
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,081
<i>All civilians should immediately evacuate</i>
<i>to a shelter…</i>

30
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,750
-Shut off the lights.
-<i>…lock all doors…</i>

31
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,754
<i>…and take all life-saving measures…</i>

32
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,470
It's all a misunderstanding!

33
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,264
-Senpai, smile!
-Smile?

34
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,682
Right. Got it. Smile.

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,895
<i>Oh, shit. This won't work.</i>

36
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,022
I knew it!

37
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,442
You all right, gramps?

38
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:08,624
I did this to him? I'm seriously a kaiju!

39
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,835
-What is it?
-An explosion? Are you okay?

40
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,463
Is that a kaiju?

41
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,715
Officers are on their way.

42
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:17,633
Let's run!

43
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,971
Right. We don't want to cause more trouble
for the hospital.

44
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,973
Let's leave through this window!

45
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,562
I knew it!

46
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,649
What's going on with this body?

47
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:37,528
-Call the doctor, now!
-Let's run, senpai!

48
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,612
What?

49
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:41,156
Hey! Wait!

50
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,712
The kaiju escaped from
South Yokohama General Hospital.

51
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,880
It's heading towards an Evacuated Area.

52
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,843
<i>What the hell's going on?</i>

53
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,053
<i>Senpai turned into a kaiju?</i>

54
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,597
<i>Since when? Why?</i>

55
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,350
<i>Anyways, is that even a kaiju?</i>

56
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,645
I want to confirm this just in case.

57
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,689
You really are senpai, right?

58
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:17,067
I'm not so sure myself!

59
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,780
What the hell is that? You transformed!

60
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:24,116
I want to know myself!

61
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:34,251
Look, Ichikawa! I'm eating a live bird!

62
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,546
So gross! You're really gross, senpai!

63
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,550
-Oh, I turned back.
-Your transformations are gross!

64
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:45,179
-Oh no, Ichikawa!
-What is it this time?

65
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,476
-I really need to pee.
-Right now? Hold it in!

66
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,936
This body's going to pee no matter what!

67
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,898
I can't do anything to stop it!

68
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:57,399
I don't want to.

69
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:00,569
I'm a human, an adult.
I don't want to pee in public!

70
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:04,156
Where is it going to come out of?
I can't find any holes.

71
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,587
-Senpai!
-No one will marry me anymore.

72
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,881
I'll die right here!

73
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,383
There are other things
to worry about right now!

74
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,637
Come on. Let's go!

75
00:06:27,221 --> 00:06:29,014
Hey, Ichikawa.

76
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,893
What's going to happen to me now?
Could I join the Defense Force?

77
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,895
There's no way!

78
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,232
You're on the side of being neutralized.
You'll be killed on the spot!

79
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,235
Right? I knew it!

80
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,238
<i>Huh? In that case…</i>

81
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:52,121
<i>There's no way I'll ever become</i>
<i>a Defense Force officer.</i>

82
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,252
<i>Shit! After I swore to myself</i>
<i>that I'll catch up to her!</i>

83
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:01,755
<i>How could I, with this body?</i>

84
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,384
Senpai!

85
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,178
{\an8}ROAD CLOSED

86
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:13,100
This is a restriction line. There won't
be any civilians beyond this point.

87
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,271
-Senpai?
-Quiet. Someone's coming.

88
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,272
An officer?

89
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,066
No, it's from underground.

90
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,610
This is…

91
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,327
Another kaiju?

92
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,205
Cart 2, continue forward.

93
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,624
We'll head to a new point.

94
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,547
This is the same species that attacked us.

95
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,424
You can tell?

96
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:48,969
But this will split the number of officers
assigned to attack you.

97
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:50,429
Now's our chance to hide!

98
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:54,224
Luckily, all civilians have been evacuated
from your report.

99
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,643
Let's hope there are no victims!

100
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,203
Mom!

101
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,371
Run…

102
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:18,457
quickly…

103
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,293
Give me a second. I'll save you!

104
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:38,060
-Run!
-I won't go without you!

105
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:47,528
Run… please…

106
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,697
Please. Please!

107
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,700
Please!

108
00:08:55,994 --> 00:09:00,374
-No! Mom!
-Please!

109
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:21,520
So powerful!

110
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,566
You okay?

111
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,611
Right, sorry about that. Well…

112
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:32,990
-Smile!
-No!

113
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,283
I'm sorry!

114
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,827
I'll go away! Don't cry!

115
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,538
-Senpai!
-Yeah.

116
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,796
Mom!

117
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,215
She's just unconscious. She'll be fine.

118
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,467
-Really?
-Yeah.

119
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,476
Ichikawa, look after those two.

120
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,728
What are you doing?

121
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:10,319
I'm going to punch him for real.

122
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,321
Step back!

123
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,574
One, two…

124
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,747
Three!

125
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,781
That was…

126
00:10:57,032 --> 00:11:00,452
Something you should never do to humans.

127
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,876
Senpai?

128
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,003
It'll be all right.

129
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,506
Take her to the hospital.

130
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,230
Listen. The Defense Force
will be here any minute.

131
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,108
I'll go away. You'll feel better then.

132
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,913
Kaiju-san?

133
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,042
Thank you.

134
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:52,754
Thanks.

135
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,259
It's not so scary when it's the two of us.

136
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,179
Yeah! We'll be stronger together!

137
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,264
Let's go!

138
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,622
Right.

139
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,334
I have to go.

140
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,337
Senpai! I just called
the emergency services.

141
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,381
Let's go before they arrive.

142
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,676
Senpai?

143
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:43,430
Ichikawa. I decided not to give up.

144
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,562
I have to be by her side.

145
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,539
What happened here?

146
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,334
What the hell is this?

147
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,560
Tell me about the kaiju you saw.

148
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:32,354
Kaiju.

149
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,027
It'll be okay.

150
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,240
I'm going to defeat all the kaiju.

151
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,616
Really?

152
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:56,169
Please don't defeat
that nice kaiju-san, though.

153
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,715
He saved my mom.

154
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,266
{\an8}A SKETCH BASED ON WITNESS ACCOUNTS

155
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,600
{\an8}<i>Kaiju No. 8.</i>

156
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,354
{\an8}<i>This became the eighth kaiju</i>
<i>with a code name</i>

157
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,439
<i>provided by the Defense Force.</i>

158
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,860
<i>No. 8 remains on the run,</i>

159
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:23,488
-<i>and the Defense Force is on high alert…</i>
-They haven't found him yet?

160
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,115
Right?

161
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,033
Maybe it's dead already.

162
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,787
<i>This became a bigger deal</i>
<i>than we expected.</i>

163
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,330
WITNESS - AGED 103

164
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:36,042
<i>Three months have passed. Senpai</i>
<i>became the first unneutralized kaiju</i>

165
00:14:36,126 --> 00:14:38,378
<i>since the founding of the Defense Force.</i>

166
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,298
<i>He's now pursued by Defense Force officers</i>
<i>around Japan.</i>

167
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,800
Right, Ichikawa.

168
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,012
This was delivered to you and Kafka.

169
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,514
He had the morning shift, so he's on-site.

170
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:51,766
-Take this to him.
-Yes, sir.

171
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,978
It's already that time of year, huh?

172
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:59,149
Kafka used to apply every year.

173
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,483
It's an annual event.

174
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,903
Along with the "sorry-you-didn't-pass"
party afterward.

175
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,322
YOU HAVE PASSED THE PRELIMINARY ROUND…

176
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,617
-Nice. Great job!
-As expected of you!

177
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,576
Thanks.

178
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,579
Should I take this to Kafka?

179
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,582
No, it's all right. I'll bring it to him.

180
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,644
-Looks like he passed, too.
-But this year is his last chance.

181
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:39,272
God, I really hope he makes it.

182
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,692
He's been working hard for so many years.

183
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,662
Senpai!

184
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,831
We passed the preliminary round!

185
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,834
Seriously?

186
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,629
Why are you all exposed?

187
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,674
Isn't it too early to be this violent?

188
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,468
Your face!
Do you even know what's going on?

189
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:12,681
Shit. It still comes out
without me realizing.

190
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,059
-All good now!
-Not good at all!

191
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,436
You were on the news just now,
in the office!

192
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,230
You have to be more careful!

193
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,816
Got it, got it. I'm sorry!

194
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,403
<i>As for senpai and me…</i>

195
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,408
-You're the patients!
-Are you all right?

196
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,702
Yes, we're fine.

197
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:37,038
<i>We told them we evacuated</i>
<i>after being shocked by the kaiju.</i>

198
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,042
<i>Looks like no one knows yet, but…</i>

199
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,673
This is yours, senpai.

200
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,341
SELECTION RESULTS

201
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,176
YOU HAVE PASSED THE PRELIMINARY ROUND…

202
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,179
Oh, good. I'm glad.

203
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,932
I thought you would be happier.

204
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:58,685
I always get rejected in the second round!

205
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,395
Why do you look so proud?

206
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,189
So, what's your plan?

207
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:06,568
You really intend on going
to the second round with that body?

208
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:09,362
It'll be okay! I'll hide it really well!

209
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,156
That's not reassuring!

210
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,992
Preliminaries are just documents
and written exams.

211
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,578
There'll be a bunch of officers
at the second round!

212
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,163
You could get killed on the spot--

213
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,831
Even so, I'm going.

214
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:26,838
I did a bunch of research
in the three months we had,

215
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,008
but I couldn't find any way
to turn back my body.

216
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:33,094
I'm 32 now.
This year's round of applications

217
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,014
is truly my last shot.

218
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,265
JAPAN DEFENSE FORCE
RECRUITING OFFICERS

219
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,018
I understand.

220
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,106
But no matter what happens to you,
I'm going to keep pushing forward.

221
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,817
You're my rival, after all.

222
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,409
This cap is so tight!

223
00:17:57,952 --> 00:17:59,996
I take it all back! Don't take the exams!

224
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,791
Wait, I'll be okay!

225
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,335
-I'll hide it better during the exams!
-Let me go!

226
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,878
Don't abandon me!

227
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,672
I won't help you, no matter what!

228
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,676
Everyone's arriving soon.
Pull yourself together!

229
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:24,104
I'm so glad! If he passed and I didn't,

230
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:27,315
I would've failed as a senpai!

231
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,363
All right. Time for a rematch.

232
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,992
{\an8}TEN DAYS LATER

233
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,127
{\an8}UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT

234
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:52,340
{\an8}DEFENSE FORCE SCREENING EXAM SECOND ROUND
WEST TOKYO HALL

235
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:02,142
MONSTER SWEEPER INC.

236
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,358
Wow.

237
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,486
So, this is the Defense Force's
Tachikawa Base.

238
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:19,033
It's much bigger than the Kumagaya Base
that I visited on a field trip.

239
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:22,203
This is attached to the Japan
Ground Self-Defense Force base.

240
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:24,664
During emergencies,

241
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,417
they work together to dispatch officers
all around West Tokyo.

242
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:31,671
If you transformed right here,
you'd never survive.

243
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:51,566
Freaking out won't help us. Let's go!

244
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,694
-Hey, old man.
-We're a bit early,

245
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,196
but let's go sign in.

246
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,907
-Listen, old man!
-Senpai.

247
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,912
Yes, I'm talking to you.

248
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,456
Took you long enough, old man.

249
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,792
OLD MAN?

250
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,628
Huh? Me?

251
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,963
<i>She's an applicant, too?</i>

252
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,263
I'm not old! I'm still 32!

253
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,724
-So, you are old.
-I am?

254
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,977
She's not wrong.

255
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:31,856
That piece of junk is yours, right?
It's in the way.

256
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,859
I can't park my car there. Move it over.

257
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,698
-This lot is super empty!
-I want to park there.

258
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,409
My lucky number of the day is five.

259
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:49,290
Lucky number of the day, you say?

260
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:53,044
You spoiled little girl…

261
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,671
Come with me!

262
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,007
This young man will teach you a thing
or two about manners.

263
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,219
Fine. I'll move it myself.

264
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,809
Geez, what are you doing?

265
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,692
<i>That suit…</i>

266
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,385
That's company property!

267
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,555
Who are you?

268
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,099
I'm applicant number 2016.

269
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,979
Kikoru Shinomiya.
My hobby is killing kaiju.

270
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,148
Remember my name, all right?

271
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,526
<i>Shinomiya! That means her family is…</i>

272
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,528
Forget that. Hey, old man.

273
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:08,786
You smell like kaiju.

274
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,961
