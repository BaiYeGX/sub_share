00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:08,092
ORIGINAL WORK BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

2
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:39,266
You're working too hard.

3
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,314
{\an8}What do you think you're doing?

4
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,401
Aren't you worried about Old Man?

5
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,571
You even agreed to get transferred
to another division.

6
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,492
I want to be stronger.

7
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:00,287
You can become stronger here.

8
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,581
That's how we've done it until now, right?

9
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:06,919
You're right.
I think we can get stronger if we stay.

10
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:11,841
But I want to get stronger
as quickly as possible.

11
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:17,471
I don't want to be protected.

12
00:02:17,555 --> 00:02:19,223
Next time, I want to be the one
to protect Senpai.

13
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:22,810
Next time? You think Old Man
can come back?

14
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:23,894
I believe it.

15
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,275
When that time comes, I don't want to have
any regrets because of my weakness.

16
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,277
Sure, me too, but…

17
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,865
Shit, I'll do it too, then!
I can't be losing to you!

18
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,284
It's rowdy in here.

19
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,369
Senpai…

20
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,038
Today is when they decide
Hibino's punishment.

21
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:48,419
-So, we were all a bit restless.
-You guys too, right?

22
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,045
It'll be okay!

23
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:52,673
We wrote the petition
with everyone's help.

24
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,759
Captain Ashiro got summoned
to Headquarters, too.

25
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,512
-Captain did?
-Yes.

26
00:02:58,596 --> 00:03:01,765
I'm sure she was summoned
to receive good news.

27
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,650
This is Mina Ashiro.
I am here by order of my superiors.

28
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,573
<i>Director General Shinomiya is assessing</i>
<i>Kaiju No. 8 right now.</i>

29
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,409
<i>-Please wait there until it is complete.</i>
-Roger.

30
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:27,082
<i>You are an observer.</i>
<i>You have not been provided a seat.</i>

31
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:44,391
Stop it! You're a human, Kafka Hibino!

32
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:53,067
<i>He's fast! But these are just thoughtless</i>
<i>attacks of an animal. He's defenseless.</i>

33
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,289
<i>A self-destructive attack, based</i>
<i>on the premise that he'll regenerate.</i>

34
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:12,544
<i>If I think in human terms,</i>
<i>he'd get the better of me.</i>

35
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:14,880
<i>Stop it!</i>

36
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,849
<i>Without No. 2's armor,</i>
<i>I would've died right there.</i>

37
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,144
<i>Squadron-Style Combat Technique Number 2…</i>

38
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,897
Force Blast!

39
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,403
Expanding the field of damage
using a sonic boom.

40
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,531
This is an attack method
that No. 2 used often.

41
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,368
<i>His core is gone?</i>

42
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,583
<i>He used his flesh as bait</i>
<i>to regenerate from his core?</i>

43
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,586
<i>This guy's fighting method is crazy!</i>

44
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,046
<i>My body won't last this way!</i>

45
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:03,387
No way!
That's the hardest shelter we have!

46
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:05,723
He only broke through the second layer.

47
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,267
Theoretically, it can withstand
a Fortitude 10 attack!

48
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,769
Some damage is to be expected.

49
00:05:14,148 --> 00:05:15,357
After all, this is a fight

50
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:20,279
between two Identified Kaiju
reaching across time.

51
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,324
<i>Amazing.</i>

52
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:27,161
<i>He's fighting at an Identified Kaiju level</i>
<i>all on his own!</i>

53
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,163
But this is strange.

54
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,750
If he meant to kill No. 8,
he should have finished him off

55
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,378
in the first attack,
when he was in his human form.

56
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:38,922
But Isao looks like

57
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:43,385
he's trying to push No. 8 past his limit.

58
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,180
What is he planning?

59
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,185
<i>Could it be…</i>

60
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:54,396
<i>Dad's trying to give Kafka Hibino</i>
<i>the chance to live?</i>

61
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,444
I joined

62
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,614
the Defense Force to save people.

63
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,911
But it was me that got saved
by Kafka Hibino.

64
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,788
But he's…

65
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,918
You shouldn't judge anyone based
on their background or what they say.

66
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:21,548
You should judge them
based on what they do.

67
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,633
That's what I think.

68
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,221
Yeah. You're exactly right.

69
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,142
DAD

70
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:37,689
The only truth is action, huh?

71
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,579
No!

72
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:59,837
No. 8's strength is starting to surpass
Isao's predictions.

73
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,175
<i>This is bad. I have to stop this guy.</i>

74
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,511
Shit! Stop it!

75
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,820
<i>I have to do something</i>
<i>or Deputy General will…</i>

76
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,080
Don't mess with me!

77
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:21,585
<i>Like I'd let you kill Kikoru's father</i>
<i>while she's watching!</i>

78
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,763
If I ever find out that you're
a danger to humans,

79
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,057
<i>I'll kill you myself.</i>

80
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,644
<i>Even then…</i>

81
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,982
<i>Even then, I want to…</i>

82
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,821
<i>I want to believe in him!</i>

83
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:54,826
Don't be losing to some kaiju,
stupid Kafka!

84
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,082
<i>I… I…</i>

85
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:10,634
<i>I'm…</i>

86
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,677
APPLICATION RESULTS

87
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,554
<i>I'm always like this.</i>

88
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,933
<i>I'm always losing</i>
<i>where it's most important.</i>

89
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,405
<i>Damn it.</i>

90
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,291
<i>I expected more from him,</i>
<i>but this is where it ends.</i>

91
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,453
I'll always…

92
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,289
I'll always wait for you.

93
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:53,945
I'm…

94
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,824
I'm not Kaiju No. 8.

95
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,536
I'm Kafka Hibino.

96
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,314
Drop the weapon,

97
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,358
Narumi.

98
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,538
You never sent the signal for backup.

99
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,455
DEFENSE FORCE DIVISION ONE CAPTAIN:
NARUMI GEN

100
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,833
I thought you planned on dying.

101
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,835
Don't be dumb.

102
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,171
Though I do admit, things didn't go
according to my predictions.

103
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:56,967
Medical team, contain No. 8 right away.

104
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:00,595
His core may be damaged.

105
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,224
So, what do you plan

106
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:06,351
on doing with him?

107
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,360
The assessment by General Deputy Shinomiya
is now complete.

108
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:20,615
Finally, we want to ask you
your impressions of him on the field,

109
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,577
-Captain Mina Ashiro.
-Yes, sir.

110
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:28,373
You've been watching Kafka Hibino
since he tested to join the force.

111
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:33,128
According to these documents,
you knew him before then.

112
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,337
Yes.

113
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:38,467
However, my personal relationship has not
influenced my decision on his admission.

114
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:43,096
According to records, she rejected
Kafka Hibino's application.

115
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:47,934
He got accepted as a cadet due
to the support of Vice-Captain Hoshina.

116
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:54,774
Let me say this before we start.
Our decision is already made.

117
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:58,737
Your report is just a formality
for the records.

118
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,031
Therefore, your statements
will not influence

119
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:04,242
our decision about Kaiju No. 8.

120
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,079
We don't want you to feel responsible

121
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,832
for our final decision.

122
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes, sir.

123
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,502
Go on.

124
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,005
I do not know whether Kafka Hibino
is a man or kaiju.

125
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,258
That is up to the experts to judge.

126
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:25,388
So, today, I will discuss Kafka Hibino's
actions as an officer.

127
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:30,519
At the Sagamihara Neutralization Plan,
Officer Kafka Hibino

128
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:34,898
<i>discovered the reproduction organs</i>
<i>of the yoju and contributed greatly.</i>

129
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:40,362
<i>He continued to work diligently after that</i>
<i>and saved his colleagues many times.</i>

130
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:46,952
<i>His greatest accomplishment against</i>
<i>No. 10. He destroyed the yoju explosives</i>

131
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:50,163
and saved Division Three
from possible complete destruction.

132
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,165
How is this relevant?

133
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,544
That accomplishment was possible
because he used his kaiju powers.

134
00:13:55,627 --> 00:13:59,130
His immense success despite being
a mere rookie officer further proves

135
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:01,091
he is a kaiiju.

136
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,343
Yes. You're exactly right.

137
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,682
His Unleashed Combat Power
when he joined was at 0%.

138
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,351
When he joined the Force,
he squeezed in as a cadet.

139
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,856
He's been rejected from the Defense Force
12 times in a row.

140
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,902
His age, too. He's the oldest
amongst the rookies.

141
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:25,657
So, he committed fraud to join the Force
using his kaiju powers!

142
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,535
Even so, he didn't give up.

143
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:34,040
No matter how many times he got rejected
or if his Combat Power was zero

144
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:37,085
or if his body turned into a kaiju,

145
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:40,422
he never stopped saving people.

146
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,551
As far as I know, Kafka Hibino

147
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:48,513
is the most persistent, dedicated,

148
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,765
and…

149
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,897
Meeko!

150
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:36,061
…the most humanistic person I know.

151
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,399
How do we judge whether Kafka Hibino
is an officer that can be trusted?

152
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,987
We judge him by his heart.
That's what I believe.

153
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,534
We are not asking for your opinion here!

154
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,119
Don't cover for your subordinates.

155
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,706
His heart, you say? We can't rely
on such an unreliable thing!

156
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:01,002
Good work, Captain Ashiro.

157
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,046
Go back to your post.

158
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,395
We've now listened to input
from the field.

159
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:22,065
Now, no one will consider
our decision too hasty.

160
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,442
We're prepared to deliver
any kind of punishment.

161
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,444
Deputy General, your decision?

162
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,657
No. 8 will be…

163
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,875
<i>I was so frustrated</i>

164
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,336
<i>at how little I could do.</i>

165
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,173
<i>I thought I'd never forgive kaiju</i>

166
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,384
<i>for making Mina cry this much.</i>

167
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:55,932
<i>So if I turned into a kaiju,</i>
<i>both body and mind,</i>

168
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,394
<i>I wanted to die as a human.</i>

169
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:09,362
I'm…

170
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,364
alive?

171
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,533
So, you're awake.

172
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,453
Deputy General Shinomiya!

173
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,874
Don't look so guarded.
I don't mean to do you any harm.

174
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,417
I'm so glad.

175
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:25,962
If anything

176
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,423
happened to you, sir,

177
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,176
I couldn't look Kikoru in the eyes.

178
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,060
If I'm alive, does this mean
I've been accepted as a human

179
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,146
and as a Defense Force officer?

180
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,233
If the thing inside your chest

181
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,987
was the weak heart of a human,

182
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,157
you would most likely be dead.

183
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:58,036
I'll tell you what our decision is.

184
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,705
You are a kaiju.

185
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,587
But it's yet undecided
whether you are our enemy or not.

186
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,842
Right now, most are against
keeping you alive.

187
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:16,096
Kaiju No. 8

188
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,849
will not be turned into a weapon.
Instead, he will fight for us.

189
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:24,145
I object! To keep a kaiju alive
and use him as a soldier?

190
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,439
-It's dangerous.
-No one has done it before!

191
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:28,942
I'm not Kaiju No. 8.

192
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,695
I'm Kafka Hibino.

193
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,534
My assessment was that he can be managed.

194
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:43,081
He has been working on missions
with Third Division for a few months now.

195
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,002
We do not know whether his immense power
could be transferred into a weapon.

196
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,047
With daikaiju appearing in swarms,

197
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:54,008
we must take full advantage
of our fighting capacity.

198
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:57,512
-But there is no precedent for this.
-Precedent?

199
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:02,517
Things like that are minuscule compared
to the defense of our nation.

200
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,604
Have you forgotten

201
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,483
the swarm disaster ten years ago,
with No. 6 at the center?

202
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:15,822
We lost over 200 officers
and three captains in that fight.

203
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:17,824
Your wife, too.

204
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:22,579
When the number of kaiju that appears
surpasses our predicted number,

205
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,831
countries can perish easily.

206
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,626
If we use No. 8's unprecedented power
to our advantage,

207
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,837
he could be our hope.

208
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:37,552
-Even so, we…
-They're against it.

209
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,389
Kafka Hibino.

210
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,391
<i>He called my name!</i>

211
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:48,146
To survive, you must show us
how useful you can be to us.

212
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,150
<i>They're barely</i>

213
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,403
<i>letting me live so that I can</i>
<i>be their weapon.</i>

214
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,447
Even so,

215
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,116
I think of myself
as a Defense Force officer.

216
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,913
I'll make them accept me
as a Defense Force officer.

217
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,900
MINA ASHIRO
KAFKA HIBINO'S PUNISHMENT IS PUT ON HOLD

218
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:42,659
<i>Even so,</i>

219
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,453
<i>we can't just be celebrating.</i>

220
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,291
<i>Next time, I have to be stronger, too.</i>

221
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:53,670
<i>Otherwise, I can't stop him</i>
<i>when the time comes.</i>

222
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,672
Hey.

223
00:20:56,506 --> 00:20:58,383
Did the SDF have anything to do with this?

224
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,010
No, they didn't.

225
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,930
That means

226
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,604
{\an8}Kafka Hibino won this himself.

227
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:20,697
-Yes.
-Yeah, he did it!

228
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:25,910
Old Man did it! I knew it.
It was fated to be this way!

229
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:26,995
Hell, yeah!

230
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,247
I'm so glad Hibino-san will be okay!

231
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,416
It'll get chaotic in here again.

232
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,627
{\an8}Hey, Reno. Old Man will be safe!

233
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,337
{\an8}I knew it already.

234
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:40,008
{\an8}I told you that Senpai
will be back for sure.

235
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,677
<i>I'll become</i>

236
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,763
<i>stronger than ever before</i>
<i>and wait for you, Senpai.</i>

237
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,100
I'm glad Hibino-san will be okay.

238
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,185
But now is where
the real challenge begins.

239
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:56,190
{\an8}If it gets out that there is a kaiju
inside the Defense Force…

240
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,319
{\an8}That will be kept confidential.

241
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,571
{\an8}Things like this get out eventually.

242
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,823
{\an8}I'm sure the higher-ups know that.

243
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:05,199
{\an8}In that case…

244
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:10,747
{\an8}Kafka Hibino has to prove his worth
in a way that everyone would accept him.

245
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,834
{\an8}I told you, the real challenge
is just beginning.

246
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,845
{\an8}Hey. We're not done here. Wake up!

247
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,307
{\an8}Wait for me,

248
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,059
{\an8}Mina.

249
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,696
What? You lost?

250
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,282
You only played for seven minutes?
That's so fast!

251
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,326
It's not my fault!

252
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:53,289
This Number 9 guy appeared out of nowhere
last week and immediately beat everyone!

253
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,543
{\an8}TOTAL RANKING
1. NUMBER 9

254
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:59,087
{\an8}It's that easy, huh?

255
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,508
I understand the basic intellect level
of humans now.

256
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,928
For each individual, it's not that high.

257
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:12,517
The accumulation of knowledge across
generations, that's their real strength.

258
00:23:13,976 --> 00:23:15,353
How's it going over there?

259
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,023
I've learned the general structure
of the base now.

260
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:24,112
Now, we can move onto
the next step of our plan.

261
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,615
I see. In that case…

262
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:35,206
Let's return the kaiju power
that has fallen into human hands

263
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:38,960
{\an8}back to the hands of a kaiju,
where it belongs.

264
