ORIGINAL WORK BY NAOYA MATSUMOTO

2
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:42,478
I'll take care of No. 8.

3
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:49,902
<i>What should I do?</i>

4
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:54,573
<i>I can't use this attack</i>
<i>on Vice-Captain Hoshina!</i>

5
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:04,250
The blade went through.

6
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,753
<i>He's not someone I can fight off</i>
<i>while holding back.</i>

7
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:20,724
<i>He's too fast.</i>
<i>I can't heal myself quickly enough!</i>

8
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:26,856
<i>He's much faster</i>
<i>than the humanoid kaiju from before!</i>

9
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,609
<i>When I saw Kikoru's moves</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

10
00:02:30,693 --> 00:02:32,486
<i>it was unbelievable to me.</i>

11
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,073
<i>But he's in a completely</i>
<i>different world from hers.</i>

12
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,703
<i>These aren't the movements of a human!</i>

13
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,959
<i>I dodged that move! What is this?</i>

14
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,335
<i>An imperceptible sword attack?</i>

15
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,837
Core, confirmed.

16
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,765
<i>Looks like I'm also not human, huh?</i>

17
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,268
<i>Now that I've tried it,</i>

18
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,770
<i>I know reconstruction</i>
<i>takes up a lot of stamina.</i>

19
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,689
<i>I can't keep taking these attacks!</i>

20
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,237
<i>Hey, seriously?</i>
<i>I'm giving him the best I've got.</i>

21
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,281
<i>This guy is probably…</i>

22
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,117
<i>well over Fortitude 8.0.</i>

23
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,453
<i>He'd be classified as a Daikaiju.</i>

24
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,957
<i>But what is this strangeness</i>
<i>I've been feeling?</i>

25
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,170
<i>That's not my problem.</i>

26
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,689
<i>A double-combo attack</i>
<i>of the invisible blade!</i>

27
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:56,070
<i>That's not it. The double-combo</i>
<i>was just a decoy.</i>

28
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,447
Mist Slasher!

29
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,449
<i>A triple-combo attack?</i>

30
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,951
<i>I got him.</i>

31
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:06,455
<i>The blade… The blade won't move.</i>

32
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,459
<i>That was close.</i>
<i>He was more powerful than I thought.</i>

33
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:13,963
<i>But now that he's seen my core,</i>

34
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,215
<i>I knew that would be his target!</i>

35
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,216
Shit!

36
00:04:38,404 --> 00:04:39,738
I let him get away.

37
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:46,453
<i>Reporting back.</i>

38
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,331
Kaiju No. 8

39
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,625
has escaped.

40
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,848
<i>Kaiju No. 8. Kafka Hibino…</i>

41
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,184
I'll take it from here.

42
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,910
<i>Can I continue to believe in him?</i>

43
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,418
I'm back.

44
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,922
Sorry for making you worry.

45
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,925
What? I wasn't worried at all.

46
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,928
I have more important things
to say to you right now.

47
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:46,930
Hey!

48
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:51,810
Sorry.

49
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,937
I let him get away.

50
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:57,191
The one that hurt you.

51
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,693
I don't care about that.

52
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,653
I'll kill him myself.

53
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:08,202
Where are you going in that state?

54
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,122
Ichikawa and Iharu are really hurt.

55
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,582
I have to go to them.

56
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:17,586
Like you're going to be of any help.

57
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,672
I'm sure they're fine.

58
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,510
The Defense Force is already incorporating

59
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,845
kaiju reconstruction
into their own technology.

60
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,431
Worry about yourself right now, Kafka!

61
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:33,227
Officers found you, and you interacted
with Vice-Captain Hoshina!

62
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,230
They may have figured something out
at this point!

63
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,165
You look depressed. That's new.

64
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,796
Damn. You found me at my lowest state.

65
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,299
-I'll keep a record of it to commemorate.
-Stop it!

66
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,304
So, was he strong, this Kaiju No. 8?

67
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,392
He's probably a Daikaiju.

68
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:19,773
In that case, it's our first one
since the one in Fukuoka five years ago.

69
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,153
Luckily, there haven't been any victims
of Kaiju No. 8 in the past few months.

70
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,157
He doesn't seem the type
to attack humans for no reason.

71
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,868
<i>That's right. This strange feeling.</i>

72
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:35,456
<i>Why did No. 8 break my weapon</i>
<i>without targeting me?</i>

73
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,458
<i>His fighting style was very strange.</i>

74
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,751
<i>His movements, his reactions.</i>

75
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:43,881
<i>It didn't feel like I was fighting</i>
<i>a kaiju. He was more like a human.</i>

76
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,009
You should rest for now.

77
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:49,761
I'll take over from here.

78
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,556
No matter what type he is,

79
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,058
if he's a kaiju, he must be neutralized.

80
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,895
<i>She's exactly right.</i>

81
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,146
Roger!

82
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,108
<i>Captain! Vice-Captain!</i>

83
00:08:04,902 --> 00:08:07,571
You're too loud, Ikaruga. What's wrong?

84
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,116
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>
<i>We have some interesting information.</i>

85
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,869
The kaiju that attacked
Furuhashi and Ichikawa

86
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:18,248
is the same humanoid
that appeared during examinations.

87
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,292
But when they discovered that kaiju…

88
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,128
they're saying he was in a human form.

89
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,522
Hey!

90
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,151
Hey, did you hear me? Move out of the way?

91
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,332
What the hell?!

92
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,377
Hey, say something!

93
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,599
<i>Breaking news.</i>

94
00:09:17,683 --> 00:09:21,728
<i>Upon today's incident, the Defense Force</i>
<i>has deemed the humanoid kaiju</i>

95
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:26,275
<i>that appeared in the examination arena</i>
<i>and Sagamihara as a long-term target</i>

96
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,236
<i>and has assigned the codename</i>
<i>as Kaiju No. 9.</i>

97
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,906
So, how should I kill this

98
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,158
Kaiju No. 8?

99
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,578
Oh, this isn't good.

100
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:42,291
I have to incubate
until this form fits better.

101
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:54,469
He's awake.

102
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,808
You awake, partner?

103
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,732
Senpai… I'm glad you're safe.

104
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,280
That's my line, idiot!

105
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,242
Also, thank you.

106
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,494
Thank you for saving Iharu-kun and me.

107
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,333
Why are you thanking Old Man?

108
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,752
What? You were here too, Iharu-kun?

109
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,713
Kaiju No. 8 was the one that saved us.

110
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,089
It's not that.

111
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,384
He noticed the reproductive organs
on the yoju. That's huge!

112
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,220
I guess so.

113
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:40,265
-Thanks, Old Man.
-Yeah, no problem.

114
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:44,144
But why did that kaiju save us, anyways?

115
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:47,189
He was super strong.

116
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,067
He took out No. 9's head so easily.

117
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,861
He's a kaiju, but he was super cool.

118
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,530
I wish you guys could've seen it.

119
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,910
Why are you blushing, Old Man?

120
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:02,663
Blushing?

121
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,332
He always has this stupid face on!

122
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,585
-That's true.
-<i>I'm glad we're dealing with Iharu-kun.</i>

123
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,295
No need to punch me that hard.

124
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,176
FURUHASHI, ICHIKAWA
CONGRATS ON YOUR RECOVERY!

125
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,554
Congrats on your recovery!

126
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,516
What is this?

127
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,810
It's the party to celebrate
our first mission.

128
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,938
We were waiting until you guys
were discharged.

129
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,607
Let's start!

130
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:42,619
Here's your full course of A6-ranked
kuroge wagyu beef with marbled fat!

131
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,747
A6? I didn't know that existed!

132
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:46,998
*IT DOES NOT

133
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,751
We cannot offer anything less at a party

134
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,212
with Haruichi-sama as the host!

135
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,757
I asked for the most affordable course.

136
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,427
They're only asking
for the standard price.

137
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,970
Really? Score!

138
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,931
Why does Haruichi have all this power?

139
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:06,393
You asked him to host
without knowing who he is?

140
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,440
He's the heir to a major anti-kaiju
weapons manufacturer.

141
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:13,900
The biggest in the country,
Izumo Technology.

142
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:17,237
The company that makes
the Defense Force suits?

143
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,824
Yeah. They're richer than our family
could ever imagine.

144
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,035
That's why you asked me
to find a good restaurant?

145
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,121
Exactly.

146
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,374
Because you said you wanted everyone
to eat really good food.

147
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,669
-The best man for the job, right?
-Yeah!

148
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,090
All right, everyone.
Great job on your first mission.

149
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,678
Being off-duty with your fellow officers
all together is a rare opportunity.

150
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,265
Enjoy your time. Cheers!

151
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,143
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

152
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:54,649
So good!

153
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,652
His head just flew off! It was so cool!

154
00:12:58,737 --> 00:13:01,907
I've never seen everyone
have this much fun.

155
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:05,160
Thank you for setting this up,
Vice-Captain.

156
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:09,164
You're too soft, Ichikawa.
The real party's just beginning.

157
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,374
Huh? What do you mean?

158
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,709
What the hell?!

159
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,629
You focus too much
on the grandstand plays!

160
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,506
You let your emotions get out too much!

161
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,800
What? You're one to talk!

162
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:25,180
If you're super technically skilled
like me, you can do those kinds of things.

163
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,389
Hey, guys, don't fight.

164
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:31,144
You improvise too much.
You don't respect the basics.

165
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:35,398
You stick too faithfully to the basics.
You're one step behind everyone.

166
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,983
I'm adjusting my tempo for you.

167
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,027
Here, too?

168
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,656
Enough about that. Hey, Izumo-san!

169
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,158
Aren't your suits a little too weak?

170
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,619
I couldn't defeat a single one today!

171
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,120
It's your lack of power.

172
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,039
Oh no, Senpai's joined in!

173
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:55,835
Hey, Communications Team! The network
kept getting cut off during strategizing!

174
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,089
It's because you kept running
into obstacles without permission!

175
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,216
I told you to tell us when that happened.

176
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:04,386
-That way, we can support you!
-What?

177
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,763
Oh no, it's happening everywhere!

178
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,766
But this is…

179
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,351
So, you've realized, huh?

180
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,186
<i>Before we know it,</i>

181
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,022
<i>everyone's talking about the mission.</i>

182
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,194
<i>They're all seeing what they're lacking</i>
<i>after the first mission.</i>

183
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:24,239
<i>That's right.</i>

184
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:25,949
<i>It's not just me.</i>

185
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,035
<i>Everyone here wants to get stronger!</i>

186
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,248
What did you say?

187
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,209
You should respect your elders, you know!

188
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,670
I only respect those stronger than me.

189
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,090
Bring it on! Fight me!

190
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,800
I'll show you who's boss!

191
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,137
-Don't get carried away, bastard!
-The hell?

192
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,222
That's my line, idiot!

193
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,850
You're one stubborn bitch, aren't you?

194
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,768
I should be saying that to you!

195
00:14:58,356 --> 00:15:00,317
This happens every summer.

196
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,658
I was so happy that you reached out
to me, Young Master.

197
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,953
I thought I'd never see you again.

198
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,997
Stop it, Doujima-san.

199
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,667
I just wanted the team
to enjoy a good meal.

200
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:20,795
And, well, you and your father?

201
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,260
I haven't talked to him after that.

202
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,307
-I see.
-Sorry for making you worry.

203
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,811
Doujima-san, your cooking
was phenomenal as usual.

204
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,612
<i>Did he hear us?</i>

205
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,447
I'm taking a piss.

206
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:57,624
<i>I guess he's not the type to butt in.</i>

207
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,211
All right, quiet down!

208
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,382
It's time to move onto the announcements.

209
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,801
The announcements?

210
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,761
Kafka Hibino.

211
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:16,017
Your discovery contributed greatly
to our strategy and limiting the damages.

212
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,603
You've been promoted to General Officer.

213
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,487
Welcome to the Defense Force,
Third Division!

214
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,161
Hell yeah!

215
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,795
-Senpai!
-You did it, Old Man!

216
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,547
Don't call me old!

217
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,508
-Let's toss him in the air!
-Good idea!

218
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,722
It's a good night, huh?

219
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,977
I really hope we don't lose
any one of us here.

220
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,272
<i>Wasshoi, wasshoi!</i>

221
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:09,195
<i>Wasshoi, wasshoi!</i>

222
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,990
Yeah. I hope so, too.

223
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,006
Kafka Hibino.

224
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,885
Starting today, at this hour,

225
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,012
you will no longer be a cadet.

226
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,723
You're officially appointed
as a Defense Force Officer.

227
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:43,063
I swear to fight
with all of my body and soul.

228
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:48,818
Excuse me, ma'am!

229
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:52,864
Don't get carried away.

230
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,245
You've still got a ways to go
before fighting by my side.

231
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:05,210
<i>So, Mina remembers the promise, too!</i>

232
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:09,506
Yeah. Just watch me, Mina!

233
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,929
You addressed a superior by first name.
Fifty push-ups.

234
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:18,223
I did it again!

235
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:22,644
Kaiju No. 8 and Kaiju No.9 business

236
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,771
have summoned me to headquarters.

237
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,147
<i>That scared me.</i>

238
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:29,150
I left everything else
to Vice-Captain Hoshina.

239
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:32,153
-Ask him about the rest of the paperwork.
-Roger!

240
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,905
Also…

241
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:36,866
Hoshina was the one that recommended you.

242
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,411
Because of your accomplishments
in the previous fight, of course.

243
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,622
<i>Vice-Captain did?</i>

244
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,707
Don't let him down.

245
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,793
Roger!

246
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,633
STUDY ROOM

247
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,349
I should finish up here for today.

248
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,645
Vice-Captain would yell at me again.

249
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,114
The training room?

250
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,199
At this hour?

251
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,786
Who's the one that forgot
to turn off the lights?

252
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:37,635
<i>Vice-Captain? What's he doing?</i>

253
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,101
<i>Image training?</i>

254
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,523
<i>These movements…</i>

255
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,570
<i>It's not just any image training.</i>

256
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,990
<i>He's recreating the fight he had with me!</i>

257
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,587
Oh, it's you, Kafka.

258
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,089
You were studying this late again?

259
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,261
You too, Vice-Captain.
What were you doing this late?

260
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,473
Oh… Just strategizing for No. 8.

261
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:28,061
Next time, I'll slay him in little bits
in one slice.

262
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,899
I messed up from the first encounter.

263
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,277
If I gave my 100% from the start,
I could've beheaded him.

264
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,322
Also,

265
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:44,244
if I used Technique Number Six and not
Five, I could've shattered his core, too.

266
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,122
Why are you so scared?

267
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,209
A regular officer couldn't fight him.

268
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,295
No. 9 is probably at the same level, too.

269
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,005
That's why

270
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,675
I have to kill him.

271
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,931
<i>I knew it. He's so cool.</i>

272
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,225
<i>He's not just protecting the citizens,</i>

273
00:21:07,308 --> 00:21:09,519
<i>he's trying to protect us, too.</i>

274
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,813
Vice-Captain.

275
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:16,526
I'm going to work hard
so I can contribute, sir.

276
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,406
Don't get carried away, idiot!

277
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,325
I don't expect anything
from a one-percenter like you!

278
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,080
Excuse me, sir.

279
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:30,999
But you know…

280
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:35,169
I'll keep my expectations at 1%.

281
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:42,260
-I'm going back to the office. Go to bed.
-Roger!

282
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,828
Beginning descent.

283
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,877
