1
00:00:01,419 --> 00:00:05,423
When that Kaiju showed up
and you told me to run away...

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:09,135
If you hadn't saved my life then,

3
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:11,721
I would've died today.

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:16,976
You really should think
about joining the Defense Force.

5
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,817
Thanks, Ichikawa.

6
00:00:25,443 --> 00:00:27,486
You really are a nice guy.

7
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:31,240
I'm going to give
the Defense Force another go——

8
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:37,038
Found you.

9
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:38,664
A Kai... A Kai——

10
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,208
Senpai?

11
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,431
"Don't worry!"

12
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,267
"Whenever you get scared,

13
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,893
I'll always be right by your side!"

14
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:27,815
Hah! You read too much manga, Kafka-kun.

15
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,191
That's so corny!

16
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:34,071
Don't you dare tell my mom,
or your mom, that I said that!

17
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,782
They'll tell the whole neighborhood...

18
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:43,581
Thanks...

19
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,711
Yeah. If we're together,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

20
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,390
The Kaiju was sighted inside a hospital.

21
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:03,642
Before it can harm anyone...

22
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,230
we need to defeat it.

23
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,609
EPISODE 2: KAIJU BEATS KAIJU

24
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,611
A Miniature Kaiju
has appeared within Yokohama.

25
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,947
I repeat. A Miniature Kaiju
has appeared within Yokohama.

26
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:19,617
This alert sound is so annoying...

27
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,243
Fix it, government.

28
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:22,620
Sho-chan, hurry!

29
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:25,915
Citizens are asked to evacuate
to shelters, or lock their doors...

30
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:27,124
Turn off the lights.

31
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,212
Take necessary precaution
to keep yourself safe.

32
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,511
Oh! We can show him
it's a misunderstanding!

33
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,888
Senpai, give him a smile!

34
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:42,348
A-A smile?

35
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:43,682
Got it! A smile!

36
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,895
Yeah, that's definitely not gonna work.

37
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:50,439
I knew it!

38
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,442
Hey, gramps, you okay?

39
00:03:54,777 --> 00:03:55,694
Huh?

40
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,413
D-Did I do that?

41
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,624
I'm, like, totally a Kaiju!

42
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,835
Wh-What was that? An explosion?
Is everything okay?

43
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,963
Huh? A Kaiju?

44
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,840
The Defense Force
is probably on their way!

45
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:18,634
-Let's scram!
-Yeah!

46
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:21,303
I'll cause trouble
for the hospital if I stay here!

47
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,722
Let's escape out the window!

48
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:30,562
Should've seen that coming!

49
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,732
What's going on with my body?

50
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,901
Call the doctors!

51
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,528
Let's get going, Senpai!

52
00:04:39,321 --> 00:04:41,156
H-Hey! Wait!

53
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,712
The Kaiju is fleeing from
Yokohama South General Hospital.

54
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:56,880
It's heading for an evacuated area.

55
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,843
What's going on?

56
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,761
Senpai's a Kaiju?

57
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,597
Since when? How?

58
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,350
And wait... is he even really a Kaiju?

59
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:11,645
Um, let me just confirm real quick...

60
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,689
It's really you, right, Senpai?

61
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,942
I'm not even sure anymore!

62
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,905
What is that? Some kind of special mode?

63
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,116
That's what I want to know!

64
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:34,501
Look, Ichikawa! I'm eating a bird alive!

65
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,546
Ew! That's really disgusting, Senpai!

66
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:40,257
Oh! I'm back!

67
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,550
You even revert creepily!

68
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,427
Ichikawa, trouble!

69
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,179
Now what?!

70
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:48,390
I gotta pee!

71
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,476
Now? Hold it in!

72
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,853
No, I think
my body's gonna piss on its own!

73
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,647
I can't hold it in!

74
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,399
This isn't good!

75
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:00,569
I'm a grown man! I don't want to
piss on a public street!

76
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,321
Where would you piss from, anyway?

77
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,781
I don't see the right parts...

78
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,584
Senpai!

79
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,670
Now nobody will ever take me as a bride!

80
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,881
I'll just die here!

81
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,384
No, you've got other stuff
to worry about, right?

82
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:26,637
Now let's get going!

83
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,098
But you know, Ichikawa...

84
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,683
What happens to me now?

85
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:32,893
Think I can join the Defense Force?

86
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,895
No way! No way! No way!

87
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,855
You're what they're defending people from!

88
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:38,232
They'll kill you on sight!

89
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,235
Yeah, I figured!

90
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,361
Huh?

91
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,238
Which means...

92
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:52,204
I'll never be able to
join the Defense Force?

93
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,541
Damn it...

94
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,252
Just when I'd decided to try
and catch up to her...

95
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:01,755
How can I do that with this body?

96
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,217
Senpai!

97
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,178
NO ENTRY

98
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,556
That's a cordon.

99
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,933
Once we're inside,
there'll be nobody around.

100
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,602
Senpai?

101
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:18,272
-Shh! Something's coming.
-The Defense Force?

102
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:21,108
No, it's coming from underground...

103
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,485
What's this?

104
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,327
Another Kaiju?

105
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,205
Car 2, maintain course.

106
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,208
We'll head to the new location.

107
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,464
It's the same type
as the one that attacked us.

108
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:45,424
You can tell?

109
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:49,178
That means they'll have fewer men
to send after you, though.

110
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:50,429
This is our chance to hide.

111
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:54,224
Luckily, they already started evacuating
when the alert was sent out about you.

112
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,560
Let's just pray there'll be no casualties.

113
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,203
Mommy! Mommy!

114
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:18,457
Run... quickly!

115
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,418
Just wait! I'll get you out!

116
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,015
Run!

117
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:38,644
No! You're coming with me!

118
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:47,528
Run... please...

119
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,738
Please!

120
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,406
Please!

121
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,075
Please!

122
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,493
Please!

123
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:55,786
No!

124
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,870
Mommy!

125
00:08:56,954 --> 00:09:00,374
-Mommy!
-Please! Please! Please!

126
00:09:17,516 --> 00:09:18,850
W...

127
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:21,687
Wow. I'm really strong.

128
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,440
You okay?

129
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,734
Yeah, of course. Sorry. Sorry.

130
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:29,194
Um...

131
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,446
Smile!

132
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,990
No!

133
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,827
G-Got it! I'll be gone
in a moment! So don't cry!

134
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,538
-Senpai!
-H-Hey...

135
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:47,838
Mommy! Mommy!

136
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,507
She's just unconscious. She'll be fine.

137
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,467
-Really?
-Yeah.

138
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,435
Ichikawa, get them out of here.

139
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,728
What are you going to do?

140
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,025
I'm gonna try

141
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,319
punching it as hard as I can.

142
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,321
Let's get out of here!

143
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:16,074
One, two...

144
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:21,747
Three!

145
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,947
You, uh...

146
00:10:56,531 --> 00:11:00,452
definitely can't do that to a person.

147
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,793
Senpai...

148
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,003
It's safe now.

149
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,381
Get your mom to a hospital...

150
00:11:24,768 --> 00:11:28,230
Listen.
The Defense Force will be here soon.

151
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,149
I'll be gone in a second, so don't worry.

152
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,413
M-Mr. Kaiju...

153
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,084
Thank you.

154
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:52,879
Thank you.

155
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:57,259
Yeah. If we're together,
there's nothing to be afraid of!

156
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,179
Yeah, as long as we're together!

157
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,806
Let's go!

158
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:27,664
That's right...

159
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:30,917
I have to go.

160
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,337
Senpai, I've called for an ambulance.

161
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,548
Let's get out of here
before someone arrives.

162
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,676
Senpai?

163
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:43,305
Ichikawa, I'm not giving up after all.

164
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,729
I have to go and stand by her side!

165
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:09,498
What happened here?

166
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:12,667
What the hell?

167
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:30,560
Tell me about the Kaiju you saw.

168
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,354
The Kaiju?

169
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,110
Don't worry.

170
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:43,198
I'll wipe out all the Kaiju.

171
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,741
Really?

172
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,169
Um, do you promise not to
hurt the good Kaiju?

173
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,715
The one who saved my mom.

174
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,349
EYEWITNESS DESCRIPTION

175
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,559
Kaiju No. 8.

176
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:16,356
This is the eighth Kaiju that
the Defense Force has given a codename.

177
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:21,278
No. 8 remains at large,
the Defense Force actively hunting it...

178
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,655
They still haven't found this guy?

179
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,156
Right?

180
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,033
He's probably dead already.

181
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,787
This has gotten way out of hand...

182
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,874
It's been three months.

183
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:38,295
Senpai became the first Kaiju in history
to escape the Defense Force,

184
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,298
and every Defense Force officer
in the country is looking for him now.

185
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:43,800
Oh, right. Ichikawa.

186
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,012
You and Kafka got something in the mail.

187
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:50,640
He went to the job site early,
so take this to him.

188
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,766
Okay...

189
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,769
It's that time already, huh?

190
00:14:55,437 --> 00:14:59,065
Kafka-san used to
take the exam every year.

191
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,567
Every single year.

192
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,903
And every year, we'd have to cheer him up.

193
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:03,904
RENO ISHIKAWA

194
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,238
WE ARE PLEASED TO INFORM YOU...

195
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:06,948
Oh, you did it!

196
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,576
-Nice!
-Thanks.

197
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:12,579
Want me to take Kafka his?

198
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,039
No, it's fine.

199
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,582
I'll take it.

200
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:33,141
Looks like he passed, huh?

201
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,477
But this'll be
his last chance ever, right?

202
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,272
I want him to have his
one last shot, you know?

203
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,692
He's worked so hard for so long...

204
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:53,662
Senpai!

205
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,831
You passed the first round of exams!

206
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,834
Seriously?

207
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:02,629
Why are you exposing yourself?!

208
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,674
Wow, it's a little early
to play rough, right?

209
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,883
Your face! Your face!

210
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:08,468
Do you know what you look like?

211
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:09,886
Crap!

212
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,681
I still slip up once in a while...

213
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:14,933
All back to normal!

214
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,059
You're not back to normal!

215
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,436
You were on the news
when I was at the office!

216
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,188
You have to be more careful!

217
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:21,564
Fine! Fine!

218
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:22,816
I'm sorry!

219
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,403
Senpai and I...

220
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,198
You're the patients from the room!

221
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,408
You okay?

222
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,535
Yeah, we just barely survived...

223
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:37,038
We told everyone we ran away
when the Kaiju showed up.

224
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,042
I think we fooled everybody, but...

225
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,673
Here. This is yours.

226
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,176
WE ARE PLEASED TO INFORM YOU THAT
YOU HAVE PASSED THE FIRST ROUND OF TESTS.

227
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,637
Good. Good stuff.

228
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,890
I thought you'd be happier.

229
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,601
It's always the second round where I fail!

230
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,395
Why do you seem proud of that?

231
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:03,064
So, what will you do?

232
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,359
Are you really going to take
the second round of exams with that body?

233
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,444
It'll be fine!

234
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,487
Nobody'll know!

235
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,156
You're not gonna fool anyone!

236
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,117
The first round is just
a written test and some paperwork,

237
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,536
but there'll be officers
everywhere at the second.

238
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,163
They'll kill you on sight.

239
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,873
Even so, I'm taking it.

240
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:26,796
I've spent the past three months
trying as hard as I can,

241
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,966
and I can't find a way to turn back.

242
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:35,930
I'm 32 years old. This is my last chance.

243
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,265
JAPAN DEFENSE FORCE
RECRUITING NOW

244
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,018
All right.

245
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:45,106
But even if something happens to you,
I'm not going to drop out.

246
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:48,318
If we're gonna do this,
we're doing it as rivals.

247
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,409
I can't get the cap off...

248
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,912
I take it back!

249
00:17:58,995 --> 00:17:59,996
Skip the exam!

250
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,916
I'll be fine! I'll be fine!

251
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,376
-I'll be good when it's time for the exam!
-Transform back!

252
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,003
Don't abandon me.

253
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,672
Seriously, no matter what
happens, I'm not helping you!

254
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,676
Everybody will be here soon,
so get it together!

255
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,018
Whew... Thank goodness.

256
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,978
If he'd passed and I hadn't,

257
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:27,440
I wouldn't be able to call
myself his senpai anymore...

258
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,655
Okay. Time for my revenge match.

259
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,243
10 DAYS LATER

260
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:52,549
DEFENSE FORCE SCREENING EXAM ROUND TWO
WEST TOKYO VENUE

261
00:18:56,219 --> 00:19:02,142
MONSTER SWEEPER INC.

262
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,358
Wow...

263
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,611
So this is the Defense Force's
Tachikawa Base...

264
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,908
I went to Kumagaya Base on a field trip
once, but this one's way bigger.

265
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:22,203
They share this area
with a Self-Defense Force garrison.

266
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,290
When something happens,
both sides work together

267
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,417
to dispatch troops all over western Tokyo.

268
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,671
If you transformed here,
you'd be dead within seconds.

269
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,481
No point in getting scared.

270
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,858
Let's go!

271
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:53,693
Hey, old man.

272
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:56,196
We're a little early,
but let's get checked in.

273
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,947
I said, old man.

274
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,073
Senpai?

275
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:03,912
Yes, you.

276
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,456
Pay attention, old man.

277
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,627
OLD MAN?

278
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,628
Me?

279
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,963
Is she taking the exam too?

280
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,263
I'm not an old man! I'm still just 32!

281
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,389
That makes you old.

282
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,724
It does?

283
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,268
Well, it does.

284
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,772
That rust bucket is yours, right?

285
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:31,856
It's in the way.

286
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,859
I can't park my car, so move it.

287
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,030
There's tons of open spots!

288
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,698
I want to park it there.

289
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,409
My lucky number today is five.

290
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:49,290
Your lucky number?

291
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:53,044
What's the deal with this little brat?

292
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,587
Come with me.

293
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,799
This young man is going to
teach you a lesson in manners.

294
00:20:58,633 --> 00:20:59,884
Whatever.

295
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,261
I'll move it myself.

296
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,225
What are you going to do?

297
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,692
That suit...

298
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,385
No! The company car!

299
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,513
Wh-Who are you?

300
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:48,099
Examinee number 2016.

301
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,893
Kikoru Shinomiya.

302
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,979
My hobby is murdering Kaiju.

303
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,148
Remember that.

304
00:21:55,231 --> 00:21:58,526
Shinomiya? That last name...

305
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,528
Anyway, old man...

306
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:08,703
Did you know you smell like a Kaiju?
