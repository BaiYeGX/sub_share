1
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,766
Sure you're not pushing yourself too hard?

2
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,395
EPISODE 12: KAFKA HIBINO

3
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:45,189
What are you thinking, anyway?

4
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:49,485
You're not worried about the old dude?

5
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:52,446
You went and agreed to go to another unit.

6
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,492
I want to get stronger.

7
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:00,121
You can do that here, right?

8
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,581
That's how we've done it so far!

9
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:03,999
Yeah.

10
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,877
I'm sure I could get stronger
if I stayed, too.

11
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:08,963
But...

12
00:02:09,672 --> 00:02:11,715
I want to get stronger
as quickly as possible.

13
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:19,098
So that next time I can protect him,
instead of him having to protect me.

14
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:22,810
Next time? You really think
the old dude's coming back?

15
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:23,894
I've decided to believe.

16
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:29,191
And when he comes back,
I don't want to rue my own weakness.

17
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,277
Well, me too...!

18
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,821
Fine, damn it! I'll train too!

19
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,739
You're the one guy I refuse to lose to!

20
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,284
What are you two arguing about?

21
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,202
Platoon leaders...

22
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:43,038
Today's the day they decide
what they're doing with Hibino.

23
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,833
It's hard to stay focused,
thinking about that.

24
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,960
Same for you guys, right?

25
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,879
It'll be fine!

26
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,673
We all wrote that letter asking
for clemency together!

27
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,759
And Captain Ashiro
was summoned to HQ, too.

28
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,178
The captain was?

29
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:58,596
Yes.

30
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,599
I'm sure they called her
because they have good news.

31
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,567
Mina Ashiro, reporting as ordered.

32
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:17,364
Director General Shinomiya
is currently examining Kaiju No. 8.

33
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,617
Please remain there until he's finished.

34
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,534
Roger.

35
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:25,039
You are only here as an observer.

36
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:26,916
A seat has not been prepared for you.

37
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,056
No! You're human, right?

38
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:44,850
Kafka Hibino!

39
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,437
He's fast.

40
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,480
But he's just an animal.

41
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:53,067
He's not thinking about the opening
he leaves after his attack.

42
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,289
An attack that destroys his own body,
knowing he can regenerate?

43
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:12,544
If I try to use human common sense
in this fight, I'm going to regret it.

44
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:14,880
Stop it!

45
00:04:19,218 --> 00:04:20,135
Daddy!

46
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,849
Without No. 2's shield,
that would've killed me instantly.

47
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,144
Squadron-Style Combat Technique
Number Two:

48
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:31,897
Force Blast!

49
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:37,486
That attack expands its striking range
by using a sonic boom.

50
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:40,531
A method No. 2 put to good use.

51
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,201
The core's gone?

52
00:04:48,414 --> 00:04:51,292
He used his body as a decoy
and regenerated from his core?

53
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,420
Fighting like this is too much!

54
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,046
I'm not gonna survive this!

55
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:03,387
Impossible! That shelter's as strong
as we could make it!

56
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,514
We just lost the second layer!

57
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,267
In theory, it should survive
an attack from a Fortitude 10.0!

58
00:05:08,851 --> 00:05:10,769
We can expect to take some damage.

59
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,359
After all, we have two identified Kaiju,

60
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:20,279
No. 2 and No. 8, battling each other
across time.

61
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,157
Incredible...

62
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,161
He's facing an identified Kaiju
all on his own!

63
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,954
It's strange, though.

64
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:33,125
If he was going to kill him,
he should've done so

65
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,378
with his first attack
while he was still in human form.

66
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,922
Instead, it looks like Isao

67
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:43,385
is deliberately pushing No. 8 to test him.

68
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:46,180
I can't imagine why.

69
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:53,979
Is Daddy giving Kafka Hibino
a chance to survive?!

70
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,614
I came to the Defense Force to save lives.

71
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,786
Instead, Kafka Hibino saved mine.

72
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,579
But he...

73
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,916
Your standard for judging someone

74
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,126
shouldn't be their background,
or what they say.

75
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,633
The way I see it, people ought
to be judged by their actions.

76
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,137
Yeah, you're right.

77
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,142
FATHER

78
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,648
The only fact that matters
is what you do, huh?

79
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,829
No!

80
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:59,461
No. 8's fortitude is starting
to surpass Isao's estimations.

81
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:05,175
Crap! I have to stop this thing!

82
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,511
Damn it all! Stop!

83
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,320
I'm going to end up killing him!

84
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,080
Hell no!

85
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:21,585
I'm not killing Kikoru's dad
right in front of her!

86
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:32,679
...if I find out that you're
a Kaiju that's going to harm mankind,

87
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,015
I'll kill you.

88
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,644
I'll...

89
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,982
I'll... have to...

90
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,821
But I still want to believe in him!

91
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:55,953
Don't give in to some Kaiju,
Kafka, you idiot!

92
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,082
I... I...!

93
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:10,634
I...

94
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,593
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT...

95
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,428
This is how it always goes for me.

96
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:17,683
I always screw up at
the most important moment.

97
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:31,280
Damn it...

98
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:42,291
I had hope, but I suppose all is lost.

99
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,244
I'll always...

100
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,080
I'll always be waiting.

101
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:53,945
I...

102
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,824
I... I'm not Kaiju No. 8.

103
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,411
I'm Kafka Hibino.

104
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:29,314
Put your weapon away,

105
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,108
Narumi.

106
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,121
You kept refusing to signal for backup.

107
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,833
I thought you were
trying to kill yourself.

108
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,710
Don't be stupid.

109
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,213
I'll admit he was more than
I expected, though.

110
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,967
Medics, take No. 8 in immediately.

111
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,512
Its core may be damaged.

112
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:06,226
So, what will you do with him?

113
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:15,360
Director General Shinomiya
has finished his examination.

114
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:20,615
Lastly, we want to hear what you think
as his commanding officer,

115
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,367
Captain Mina Ashiro.

116
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:23,702
Of course.

117
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:28,373
You've seen Kafka Hibino up close
since the day he joined.

118
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:33,128
Our reports say you know him
from before that, as well.

119
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:34,296
Yes.

120
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:38,467
But from the trials to now,
I haven't given him any special treatment.

121
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:43,096
Our records show that she failed
Kafka Hibino during the exam.

122
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,851
It was Vice-Captain Hoshina's suggestion
that he be selected as a backup.

123
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,191
To be clear, we've almost
entirely reached our conclusion.

124
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,236
We simply need your report
for the paperwork.

125
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:04,242
Which means your testimony will have
no influence on Kaiju No. 8's fate.

126
00:13:04,326 --> 00:13:10,707
We don't want you to feel responsible
for what happens here.

127
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,000
Understood.

128
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,502
Speak.

129
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,880
I'll leave it to the specialists to decide

130
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,800
whether Kafka Hibino
is a human or a Kaiju.

131
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:25,263
Instead, I'll tell you what I know of him
as a Defense Force officer.

132
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:30,519
During the Sagamihara
Neutralization Operation,

133
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:34,731
Kafka Hibino contributed to his unit
by discovering Yoju reproductive organs.

134
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:40,111
He has continued to be a hard worker who
saved his comrades' lives many times.

135
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,908
Especially notable
was the battle with No. 10,

136
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:49,704
where he saved the Third Division from
being wiped out by destroying a Yoju bomb.

137
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:52,165
And so what?

138
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,544
That was only possible
because he used his Kaiju power.

139
00:13:55,627 --> 00:14:01,091
The fact that a rookie officer was
capable of all that is proof he's a Kaiju!

140
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,343
Yes, that's correct.

141
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:08,598
His unleashed combat power
at the time he joined was 0%.

142
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,351
He only passed the exam as a backup.

143
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:16,857
He'd failed the Defense Force exam
twelve times straight prior to that.

144
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,902
Age-wise, he's also
the oldest of any of our recruits.

145
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:25,657
So he must've used
his Kaiju power to cheat!

146
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,535
But he didn't give up.

147
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,122
No matter how many times he failed,

148
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,332
even though his combat power was zero...

149
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,043
Even though his body had
turned into a Kaiju...

150
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,380
He never stopped trying to save people.

151
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,551
Out of all the people I know, Kafka Hibino

152
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,513
hates giving up,
cares for others more than anyone,

153
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,181
and...

154
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,730
Miiko!

155
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,518
And he has more humanity than anyone.

156
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,064
What is the deciding factor as to whether

157
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,483
Kafka Hibino should be trusted
as an officer?

158
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,987
I believe it's his heart.

159
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,451
We're not asking your personal opinion!

160
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,119
Stop trying to cover for your subordinate.

161
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,539
We can't trust something as vague
and ill-defined as his "heart"!

162
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,919
Thank you, Captain Ashiro.

163
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,046
Return to your post.

164
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,395
We've heard what
his commanding officer felt.

165
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:22,065
Nobody will accuse us
of a hasty decision now.

166
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,234
We're ready to dispose of him now.

167
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,486
Your decision, Director General.

168
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,281
No. 8 will...

169
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:43,336
I hated myself for not
being able to do anything.

170
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:49,426
I told myself I'd make the Kaiju pay
for making her cry like that.

171
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:55,932
So I'd decided that if I was gonna
become a Kaiju in both body and mind,

172
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,310
I'd rather die as a human.

173
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,031
I'm... alive?

174
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:13,158
You're awake?

175
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,453
D-Director General Shinomiya!

176
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,371
Calm down.

177
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,665
I'm not here to hurt you.

178
00:17:20,749 --> 00:17:22,125
I'm so glad...

179
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:28,173
If anything happened to you,

180
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,176
I could never face Kikoru.

181
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,018
If I'm still alive, does that
mean you accept that I'm human?

182
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,146
That I'm a member of the Defense Force?

183
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:50,987
If what was inside your chest
was the frail heart of a human,

184
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:53,990
you would've died back there.

185
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,994
I'll tell you what the council decided.

186
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,955
You're a Kaiju.

187
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,587
But we'll decide later if you're a threat.

188
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:12,842
At the moment, most people
are opposed to letting you live.

189
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:19,849
Kaiju No. 8 will fight for us.
He will not be converted into weaponry.

190
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:21,810
I object!

191
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,937
We can't use a living Kaiju in combat!

192
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,896
It's dangerous!

193
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,439
There's no precedent!

194
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:28,942
I'm not Kaiju No. 8.

195
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:32,695
I'm Kafka Hibino.

196
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,534
I've decided that he can be controlled.

197
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:43,456
It's a fact that he's been doing missions
with the Third Division for months.

198
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,002
It's not clear if a weapon made from him
would be able to produce that much power.

199
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:50,922
With as many Daikaiju as we're seeing,

200
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:54,008
we need to use our forces
in the most optimal way possible.

201
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,427
But there's no precedent for this.

202
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,512
Precedent?

203
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:02,517
Precedents are meaningless
in the face of this country's defense.

204
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,896
Surely none of you have forgotten

205
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,483
the series of disasters involving No. 6
ten years ago.

206
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:15,822
Over two hundred officers
and three captains lost their lives.

207
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,824
Including your wife.

208
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:22,453
If a swarm of Kaiju emerges with numbers
that far exceed our estimates,

209
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,831
this nation could easily be destroyed.

210
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:28,459
But if we can utilize
his incredible power,

211
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,837
we might stand a sliver of a chance.

212
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:35,633
Even so,

213
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,385
we stand opposed.

214
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,389
Kafka Hibino.

215
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,266
He used my name?

216
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:48,146
Prove your worth if you want to survive.

217
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:54,819
So they're just leaving me alive
so I can be used as a weapon?

218
00:19:56,237 --> 00:20:00,116
I still think of myself
as a Defense Force officer.

219
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:04,913
I'll make you accept me as one too!

220
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,900
KAFKA HIBINO: DISPOSAL DEFERRED

221
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,245
But... I can't be entirely happy.

222
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:49,666
Now I need to get stronger...

223
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,670
Or I won't be able to stop him
if I need to.

224
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:55,672
Is this...

225
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:58,174
Did the JGSDF do this?

226
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:01,010
No, they didn't.

227
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:04,055
Then this is...

228
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,521
A victory Kafka Hibino won for himself!

229
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:20,697
-H——
-Hooray!

230
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:22,490
You did it, Old Dude!

231
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,952
God was watching out for you, I guess!

232
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,247
I'm so glad, Hibino-san!

233
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,416
It's gonna get noisy around here again.

234
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:34,335
Hey, Reno, it says the old dude's saved!

235
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,170
I knew.

236
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,966
I told you, right?
I was sure he was coming back.

237
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,680
When you get back, I'll be way
stronger than I am now, Senpai!

238
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:48,850
I'm glad it worked out for Hibino-san.

239
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,019
The hard part's just beginning, though.

240
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:56,190
If people outside the Force
knew we had a Kaiju...

241
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,319
Well, it's a secret, right?

242
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,529
They'll find out someday.

243
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,698
I'm sure the brass knows that too.

244
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,033
Then...

245
00:22:05,116 --> 00:22:10,580
Kafka Hibino needs to prove he's useful
enough that nobody can refuse his help.

246
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,917
Things are gonna get
even harder from now on.

247
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:24,927
Hey, we're not done talking.

248
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:25,928
Wake up.

249
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,892
Wait for me, Mina...

250
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,775
MONSTER SWEEPER INC.

251
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:43,571
Huh? You lost?

252
00:22:43,654 --> 00:22:46,282
Game duration of seven minutes?
That's fast!

253
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,117
Nothing I could do!

254
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:51,245
This "Number 9" guy
started playing last week,

255
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:53,289
and all of a sudden he's top of the pile!

256
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,502
OVERALL RANKING
NUMBER 9

257
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,087
That should do it.

258
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,508
I've figured out mankind's
intellectual level.

259
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,928
On an individual basis,
it's nothing special.

260
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:10,056
So their weapon is
the ability to accumulate knowledge

261
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:12,392
across generations, then.

262
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,353
What about on your end?

263
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,940
I've more or less figured out
the layout of the base.

264
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:24,112
Now we can move our plan
to the next phase.

265
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,031
Yes, goodbye.

266
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:35,081
Time to bring the Kaiju power
that fell into human hands

267
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,418
back to our side.
