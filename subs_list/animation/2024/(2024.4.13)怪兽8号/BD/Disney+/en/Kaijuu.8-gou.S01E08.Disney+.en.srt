00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:34,553
EPISODE 8: WELCOME TO THE DEFENSE FORCE

2
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:42,603
I'll be the one to neutralize No. 8.

3
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:49,902
What do I do?

4
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:54,573
I can't use my fists against
Vice-Captain Hoshina!

5
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,250
That seemed to work.

6
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,753
No, I won't survive this
if I try to hold back!

7
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:20,432
He's so quick, I can't harden my body
to protect myself fast enough!

8
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:26,856
He may not be stronger, but he's a hell
of a lot faster than the humanoid Kaiju!

9
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:32,111
The first time I saw Kikoru move,
I thought she was incredible.

10
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:33,612
But...

11
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:36,073
He's on a whole other level!

12
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,870
He's not even moving like a human!

13
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,833
But I dodged that!

14
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,335
What is this? Some kind of
slashing attack I can't see?

15
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:49,837
Core located.

16
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:01,765
Not that I'm human, either.

17
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:06,770
Now that I've done it, I can tell that
regenerating uses a lot of my stamina!

18
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,689
I can't take too many hits like that!

19
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,359
Wait, seriously?

20
00:03:12,985 --> 00:03:15,237
I'm not exactly joking around here.

21
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:19,992
He's probably at least Fortitude 8.0.

22
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,453
That'd make him a Daikaiju.

23
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:26,957
But what's this weird feeling
I'm getting from this fight?

24
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,170
Well, it doesn't matter.

25
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,520
Those invisible slashes...

26
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:50,689
And a double attack!

27
00:03:53,484 --> 00:03:54,777
No.

28
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,820
The double attack was a decoy!

29
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:58,447
Mist Slasher.

30
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,449
A triple attack?!

31
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:01,784
Gotcha.

32
00:04:03,619 --> 00:04:04,453
The blade...

33
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,455
The blade's stuck!

34
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:08,958
That was close.

35
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,460
That was stronger than I expected, but...

36
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:16,215
After he saw my core,
I knew he'd aim for me there!

37
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,216
No!

38
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,989
Yikes. I let it get away.

39
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,036
Reporting.

40
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,792
Kaiju No. 8 has escaped.

41
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,346
Kaiju No. 8.

42
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,848
Kafka Hibino.

43
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:09,184
Now leave the rest to me!

44
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:27,202
Is it really okay for me
to believe in him?

45
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,418
I'm back...

46
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,006
Sorry, I must've worried you.

47
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:41,925
I wasn't worried!

48
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,928
And I have more than
a thing or two to say to you...

49
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:46,930
Hey!

50
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,937
Sorry... I let it get away.

51
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,399
The one who hurt you...

52
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:59,693
I-I don't care.

53
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,904
I'll kill it myself.

54
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,202
Hey, where are you going?
You're in terrible shape.

55
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:13,582
Ichikawa and Iharu were
horribly injured... I have to go.

56
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,586
And even if you went, what could you do?

57
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:20,798
They'll be fine.

58
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:26,845
The Defense Force is starting to
use Kaiju regeneration in its tech, too.

59
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,473
You should worry about yourself instead!

60
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,141
Not only did the other officers see you,

61
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,227
you made contact
with Vice-Captain Hoshina!

62
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,355
They could easily find some clue
that leads straight to you!

63
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,457
It's rare to see you this down.

64
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,796
Cripes. You've caught me in
a really embarrassing spot.

65
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,006
I'll take a photo to remember it by.

66
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,299
Please don't!

67
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:09,221
So, was Kaiju No. 8 strong?

68
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,392
I'm assuming it's a Daikaiju.

69
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:19,773
That would make it the first one
since Fukuoka five years ago.

70
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:24,153
Fortunately, there've been no casualties
due to No. 8 these past few months.

71
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,157
It doesn't seem to be the type
to attack people indiscriminately.

72
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,868
Yeah, that's the strange feeling I had...

73
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:35,456
Why did No. 8 attack
my weapon instead of me?

74
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,458
Nothing about that battle made sense.

75
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,918
The way it moved and reacted...

76
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:43,922
It was more like fighting a human
than fighting a Kaiju.

77
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,800
For now, get some rest.

78
00:07:48,469 --> 00:07:49,887
I'll take care of this.

79
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,556
No matter what type of Kaiju it is,

80
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,058
it's our job to neutralize it.

81
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,061
Well, she's right there.

82
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,021
Roger.

83
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,108
Captain! Vice-Captain!

84
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,528
You're too loud, Ikaruga.

85
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:07,988
What's wrong?

86
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,116
Sorry. I learned something
I thought you should hear.

87
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,827
The Kaiju that attacked
Furuhashi and Ichikawa

88
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:18,248
appears to have been the same humanoid
type that appeared at the exam site.

89
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,876
When they found it,

90
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,128
it had a human form.

91
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:41,563
Hey!

92
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,733
Hey, are you deaf?

93
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,984
Out of the way!

94
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,616
What?

95
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,374
What?

96
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,002
Hey, say something!

97
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,474
Breaking news.

98
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,935
After the latest incident,
the Defense Force

99
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:24,064
has designated the humanoid-type that
appeared at the exam site and Sagamihara

100
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,358
as a long-term neutralization target,

101
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:29,236
giving it the codename Kaiju No. 9.

102
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:35,158
Now, how do I kill Kaiju No. 8?

103
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:37,536
Oh dear, oh dear.

104
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:42,833
I'll need to remain hidden
until I get used to this body again.

105
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,469
He's awake.

106
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:57,806
Hey.

107
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,808
You awake, partner?

108
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:06,690
Senpai, I'm glad you're okay.

109
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,280
That's my line, dummy.

110
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:17,200
Also... thank you.

111
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,494
For saving me and Iharu-kun.

112
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:24,249
Why are you thanking the old dude?

113
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:26,752
Iharu-kun's in the same room?!

114
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,671
It was Kaiju No. 8 that saved us, right?

115
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,507
Well, he found
the Yoju reproductive organs,

116
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,384
and that was a huge help, right?

117
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,179
Oh, good point.

118
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,097
Thanks, old dude!

119
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,265
S-Sure thing!

120
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,852
Why'd the Kaiju save us, though?

121
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:50,108
He was so strong.
He knocked No. 9's head clean off!

122
00:10:50,192 --> 00:10:52,861
For a Kaiju, he was pretty damn cool!

123
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,405
I wish you could've seen him!

124
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,910
Hey, why are you blushing, old dude?

125
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:02,704
Blushing?

126
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,290
He's got the same dumb look
on his face he always does!

127
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:06,541
Very true!

128
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,710
We're so lucky it was Iharu-kun...

129
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,337
You don't need to hit me so hard.

130
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,176
FURUHASHI & ICHIKAWA
CONGRATULATIONS ON LEAVING THE HOSPITAL

131
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,554
Congratulations on leaving the hospital!

132
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,516
W-What's this?

133
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,810
A celebration for our
first successful mission!

134
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:27,938
We were waiting for you
to get out of the hospital.

135
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,607
Okay, let's get started.

136
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:42,619
Your course of A6-grade marbled
Japanese Black Wagyu beef!

137
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:44,454
A6?!

138
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,580
Is there an A6?!

139
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:46,998
*THERE IS NOT

140
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:52,212
We could never serve less than the finest
at a party organized by Haruichi-sama.

141
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,841
I remember asking for the cheapest course.

142
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,427
You can pay the standard prices.

143
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,970
Really? Lucky us!

144
00:12:00,554 --> 00:12:03,056
Just who is Haruichi?

145
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,974
What?

146
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,476
You didn't know when you asked him
to put this together?

147
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,894
That's right.

148
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,523
He's the heir to Izumo Technologies,

149
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:13,900
the largest anti-Kaiju arms
manufacturer in the country.

150
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:17,320
The place that makes
the Defense Force suits?

151
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,824
Yeah. He's got way more wealth
than even my family.

152
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,035
So that's why you
asked me to find a place?

153
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,079
That's right.

154
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:29,958
You said you wanted everybody
to get a good meal, right?

155
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,710
And he's perfect for the job, huh?

156
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:32,669
Yeah.

157
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,090
So yeah, excellent job
on your first mission.

158
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,843
You don't get many days
when all your batchmates

159
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,678
are off at the same time.

160
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,431
So have a lot of fun!

161
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,682
Cheers!

162
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,143
Cheers!

163
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,649
Yeah, this is so good!

164
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,652
...blew his head right off!
It was amazing!

165
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:02,449
I've never seen
everybody looking so happy.

166
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,160
Thank you for putting this together.

167
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,621
Don't speak too soon, Ichikawa.

168
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,164
The show's about to start.

169
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:11,541
What do you mean?

170
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:15,754
And you're too busy trying
to show off to help your team!

171
00:13:15,837 --> 00:13:17,506
And you make everything personal!

172
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,884
You're the one person on this team
who has zero right to say that to me!

173
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,222
I don't count,
'cause I'm just that damn good!

174
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,389
Guys, don't fight...

175
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:31,144
You always do things your way
and neglect the basics.

176
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:35,482
And you do things so by the book,
you can't keep up when we work together!

177
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,983
I have to slow myself down, you know.

178
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,485
These guys too?

179
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,614
So anyway, Izumo-san...

180
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,158
You sure you guys' suits ain't defective?

181
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:47,619
I couldn't even defeat
a single one of those jerks!

182
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,120
Draw out more of its power, then.

183
00:13:49,204 --> 00:13:51,039
Not you too, Senpai!

184
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,874
Hey, you're with the comms team, right?

185
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,710
We kept losing communications
during the mission!

186
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:59,130
You're the ones who kept going inside
interference areas without telling us!

187
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:03,677
We've told you that if you give us
advance notice, we can work it out!

188
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,763
Oh no! It's everywhere I look...

189
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:09,766
But isn't this...

190
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,351
You've noticed, huh?

191
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,231
They're all talking about the mission now.

192
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:21,486
After their first mission,
they've all seen what they're lacking.

193
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:25,949
That's right. It's not just me.

194
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,160
Everybody wants to be stronger.

195
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,248
What did you say, asshole?

196
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,167
Show some respect for your elders!

197
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,670
I only respect people stronger than me.

198
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,630
All right, it's on!

199
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,800
I'll show you who's boss!

200
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:47,429
I'm tired of listening
to your whining, you know.

201
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,222
That's my line, jerk!

202
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:51,808
You don't listen, do you, girl?

203
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:53,768
You've got no right to say that to me!

204
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,233
It's a yearly tradition.

205
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,658
We were so happy you reached out
to us, young master.

206
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,912
I thought I'd never see you again.

207
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,039
Don't say that, Dojima-san.

208
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,667
I just wanted to make sure
everybody had a nice meal.

209
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,795
So, about your father...

210
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,469
I haven't talked to him since then.

211
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,388
I see.

212
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,307
I'm sorry for worrying you.

213
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,811
Dojima-san, today's meal was incredible.

214
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,612
Did he hear that?

215
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,405
Bathroom.

216
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:57,082
I guess he's not the nosy type.

217
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,294
Okay, calm down, everybody.

218
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,382
Time to make an announcement.

219
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,801
Announcement?

220
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,177
Kafka Hibino.

221
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,599
You saved a lot of lives
during the mission,

222
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,017
and that got you noticed.

223
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,645
So you're getting promoted
to full officer.

224
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,487
Welcome to the Defense Force's
Third Division.

225
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:35,161
Yes!

226
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:42,627
Senpai!

227
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:43,962
You did it, old dude!

228
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,505
Don't call me that!

229
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,382
Time to give him a victory toss!

230
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,633
Great idea!

231
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,051
Grab him, guys!

232
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,386
You help out, too!

233
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,470
Don't drop him!

234
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:53,805
It's a good night.

235
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,019
If I can stop us from losing
a single person, I want to.

236
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:05,942
Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

237
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,990
Yeah, I agree.

238
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,548
Kafka Hibino.

239
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:34,012
As of today, as of this moment,
you are no longer a cadet,

240
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,639
but a full-fledged Defense Force officer.

241
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:43,146
I swear to give everything
I have to the fight.

242
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,651
A-Anyway, I'll be going...

243
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:52,822
Don't get too excited.

244
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,245
You're a long way from being
able to fight by my side.

245
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,335
So Mina does remember!

246
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,506
Yeah, just you wait, Mina!

247
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,929
Give me fifty push-ups for failing
to address a superior by their title.

248
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,223
I did it again!

249
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,934
Kaiju No. 8

250
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:24,813
and No. 9 need to be discussed at HQ,
which requires my presence.

251
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,147
Whew...

252
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:31,528
I've put Vice-Captain Hoshina in charge,
so ask him about the paperwork.

253
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,612
Roger!

254
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,866
And... it was Hoshina who
recommended you for full officer.

255
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:40,870
Of course, it only happened because
of your success in the last battle.

256
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,622
The vice-captain...

257
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:44,874
Live up to his expectations.

258
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:46,918
Roger!

259
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,640
I guess that's enough for today.

260
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:06,062
I don't want another lecture
from the vice-captain.

261
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,197
The training room?

262
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:18,032
At this hour?

263
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,786
Who forgot to turn the lights off?

264
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:37,635
The vice-captain? What's he doing?

265
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,101
Mental imagery training?

266
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,523
But the way he's moving...

267
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,570
He's not just doing ordinary training.

268
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:59,240
He's recreating his battle with me!

269
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,545
Oh, Kafka?

270
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:15,131
You're here way too late again.

271
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:20,220
What about you? Why are you here so late?

272
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,473
Working out a strategy for No. 8.

273
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:28,061
So I can slice him in half with
a single strike next time I see him.

274
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,941
I screwed up at the start, you know.

275
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:36,277
If I'd gone all in right off the bat,
I could've chopped his head off.

276
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,322
And...

277
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,367
If I'd used technique six
instead of technique five,

278
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,244
I could've sliced him
and his core into ribbons.

279
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,122
You're getting way too scared.

280
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,209
No normal officer could handle that thing.

281
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,963
And No. 9's probably close to as strong.

282
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,005
So...

283
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,841
I've gotta handle 'em myself.

284
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,431
He really is amazing.

285
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:09,519
He's not just trying to keep
civilians safe, but us, too!

286
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,813
Vice-Captain!

287
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,651
I'll do my best to be
able to help in the fight.

288
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:21,364
Don't get so cocky, fool!

289
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,450
I don't expect a guy
with 1% power to be helpful!

290
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,080
B-Bye...

291
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:30,999
But, well...

292
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,712
You can have 1% of my expectations.

293
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,049
I'm heading back to the office.

294
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,592
You get to sleep.

295
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:42,510
Roger!

296
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,037
Initiate descent.
