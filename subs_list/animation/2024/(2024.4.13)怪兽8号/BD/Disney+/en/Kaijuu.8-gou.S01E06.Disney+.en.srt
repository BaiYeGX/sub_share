The epicenter is located in Sagamihara.

8
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:24,692
Citizens in the surrounding area are asked
to follow JGSDF orders and evacuate.

00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,818
I repeat...

10
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,653
Why Sagamihara?

11
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:29,488
Is the Defense Force here yet?

12
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,574
Mommy, I gotta go to the bathroom!

13
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,117
Stay calm, everyone!

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,579

Are we working with the JGSDF?

18
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,127
A JGSDF artillery regiment command post

19
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,172
is being constructed at the Leon Mall
parking lot.

23
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:52,636
And the Honju?

24
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,805
It first appeared at Kannawa Fault

25
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,974
and moved underground
while growing larger.

26
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:01,228
It's believed to have surfaced
because it's entered its breeding phase.

27
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:03,314
The appearance of the Honju
has been followed by

28
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,399
the appearance of a large number of Yoju.

29
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,611
Come on, how many of
these things are there?

30
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,363
Fortunately, the neutralization area
isn't that far away.

31
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,908
If we want to minimize damage
to the surrounding area,

32
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:19,080
our best option is to defeat the Honju
in the central Sector Bravo.

33
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,582
I'll handle the Honju.

34
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,877
Sector Echo will serve
as the sniper point.

35
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,631
We'll be able to target the enemies
from alongside Highway 16.

36
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,883
This operation will be designated as

37
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,344
the Sagamihara Neutralization Operation.

38
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:35,513

But don't disappoint me, Kafka Hibino.

Vice-Captain, Senpai's about to throw up!

47
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,147
Sorry! I was so nervous,
I ate too much food!

48
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,107
Normally, you get too nervous to eat!

49
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,483
Open a window! Now!

50
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,901
If you throw up, I'll kill you!

51
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,570
What's wrong with you, old dude?

52
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:33,946

EPISODE 6: SAGAMIHARA NEUTRALIZATION
OPERATION AT DAYBREAK

62
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,040
I'll brief you on the operation.

63
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,919
Captain Ashiro's unit
will handle the Honju.

64
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:57,464
The problem is that
it's creating a ton of Yoju.

65
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,843
This neutralization area
is kept deliberately clear

66
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,637
of important infrastructure
and critical transportation routes.

67
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:09,018
Your job will be to make sure
no Yoju escape from this area.

68
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:13,105
It's an important job that determines
how much damage is dealt,

69
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,442
how much it costs to rebuild from
that damage, and how long it'll take.

70
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,696
Of course, any platoon with new recruits
will be placed at the very rear.

71
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,156
But that also means...

72
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:26,452
you're our last line of defense.

73
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,248
Anybody got questions?

74
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,090
Good.

75
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,803
No matter how good your scores
are during training,

76
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,930
that won't save a single life.

77
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:52,186
It's time, recruits. Show me
what you can do on the battlefield.

78
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:57,733
All right, let's go!

79
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,035

00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:10,954

00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,722
Yeah.

87
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,266
During this mission,
I have to prove I can do the job.

88
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,061
You're never gonna be
a full officer at this rate.

89
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,814
You'll be fired in three months.

90
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,816
I won't get another shot.

91
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,985

92
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,072
I'm feeling all kinds of pressure.

93
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,492
But for some reason...

94
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:52,287
I'm also incredibly excited!

95
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,749
Yeah, that's right.

96
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,460
This is the job you've always wanted.

98
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:05,551
Let's make sure our first mission
is a big success!

99
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:07,845
Right!

100
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,514

101
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,015
They're here.

102
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,229
Time to go, Kikoru.

103
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,483
Why are you telling me what to do?

104
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:23,527
Don't die out there, Ichikawa!

105
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,154
You too, Senpai!

106
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,158
Okay!

107
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,411
Time to make my first
mission a big success!

108
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,975
Captain Ashiro has
reached the sniper point.

109
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,688
Please lure the Honju to Sector Bravo
and provide fire support.

110
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:00,606
Roger that.

111
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,358
JGSDF Artillery Regiment Command Post,

112
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,111
now initiating fire support
for the Defense Force.

113
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,182
Time for your big debut.

114
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:39,811
Start by showing your superiors
just how damn good you really are.

115
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:44,566
It's begun.

116
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,694
But it's not like the exam.

117
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,948
I feel strangely calm...

118
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:56,203
I can tell the suit is helping me.

119
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,751
Unleashing combat power!

120
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,799
You're too far out in front!

121
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,468
Your combat power is 1%,
so stay in the rear!

122
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,262
Sheesh.

123
00:09:13,345 --> 00:09:16,181
Why do we have to babysit the new kids?

124
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,143
Can't you guys just go someplace
you won't get in our way and watch?

125
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,437
Listen up!

126
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:24,815
We don't know
the enemy's vulnerable points.

127
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,776
Play it safe until we get info
from the guys on the front line.

128
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:31,154
Roger that.

129
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:34,950
I'll play it safe and blast anything
that could be a weak point.

130
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,380
What the hell?

131
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:51,008
That's not the kind of firepower
you see from a rookie!

132
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,596
So that's the power of Kikoru Shinomiya.

133
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,180
Kikoru...

134
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,683
Nice!

135
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,770
What else would you expect from me?

136
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:05,897
Abnormal vital signs detected.

137
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,317
Rapid increase in heart rate.

138
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,694
You don't need to tell me that!

139
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:14,573

140
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:19,703
There we go!

141
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,163
Two legs down. Finish it!

142
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:33,508
Well done, Furuhashi!

143
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,760
There we go!

144
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,011
You see that, Reno?

145
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:46,063
Did you do that by yourself?

146
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:48,774
Yes.

147
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:54,029
I swapped out the burst rounds
in my gun for freeze rounds.

148
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,781
I think it's a better fit for my style.

149
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,700
I can slow down the enemy while I fight.

150
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:02,788
I think, once I get the hang of this,
I'll be even better at hunting Kaiju.

151
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,501
I'm not there yet.

152
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,503
I need to get stronger.

153
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,130
So Senpai won't have to transform!

154
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,216
SECTOR J

155
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,731
They're so damn speedy!

156
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:39,991
Wh-What's the deal
with this year's recruits?

157
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,868
Platoon Leader Nakanoshima!

158
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:45,455
What's going on with those guys?
I'm losing my self-confidence here!

159
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:49,292
Hm, I knew it was a good batch this year,

160
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,752
but not this good.

161
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,046
I've taken down six already.

162
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,549
You're going a little slow,
aren't you, Haruichi?

163
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,925
Right, right.

164
00:11:57,008 --> 00:12:01,054
Don't forget that you only got four
of those six 'cause I backed you up.

165
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,308

One's the clean-cut type.

You're talking about their looks?

169
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:14,776
Vice-Captain Hoshina told me
there are a few really good ones.

170
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,570
But that's not all.

171
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:21,158
The average unleashed combat power of the
new recruits is higher than in most years.

172
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:25,537
The guys at the top are motivating
the others to do better.

173

Number eight!

174
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,039
That was totally my kill!

175
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,710
Our observation teams have verified
that Sector Juliet is clear of Yoju.

176
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:32,961
All Yoju have been defeated.

177
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:36,173
The kill reports keep coming.

178
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,466
They're all amazing!

179
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,970
Ikaruga Platoon will advance, with
Ichikawa and Furuhashi at the forefront.

180
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,181
Ichikawa and Iharu, too?

181
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,266
This is no good.

182
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,478
Everyone's working so hard,
and I'm just slowing them down.

183
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,063
Isn't there anything I can do?

184
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:54,900
Wait, didn't he just say...

185
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,401
Listen up!

186
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,737
We don't know the
enemy's vulnerable points.

187
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,574
Play it safe until we get info
from the guys on the front line.

188
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,208
I'll fight with my own weapons!

189
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:13,794
Senpai, look!

190
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,547
What the hell's he doing?

191
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,842
Wow, even with just 1%,

192
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,970
the suit makes it easy
to dismantle their bodies.

193
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,973
If they could mass-produce these things,

194
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:30,352
it'd be nice if they gave some
to the cleanup industry.

195
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,358
This is a pretty standard structure
for fungal-type Kaiju,

196
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,861
but the core's not where it usually is.

197
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:41,446
Where is it?

198
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,490
If it's not here, then maybe over there?

199
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,619
Wait a second...

200
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,957
Vice-Captain Hoshina,
I've located the Yoju core.

201
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,874
What?

202
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,001
It's at the base of the neck,

203
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:59,256
but there are hard, fibrous muscles
on top of it that serve as its backbone.

204
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,718
Officers with weaker attack power
might need to hit them from the sides.

205
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:08,181
And there's one more thing.
This one's important.

206
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,226
The Yoju have reproductive organs too.

207
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,897
The white, bumpy organs near their rears.

208
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:21,528
If we don't destroy those organs,
their corpses might spawn new Yoju.

209
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,737
Kafka.

210
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,573
That's some damn fine work.

211
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:29,911
Okonogi-chan, share that news
with the rest of the team.

212
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:30,829
Roger that.

213
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,416
Sharing information on Yoju core
and reproductive organs with all officers.

214
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,627
I'm sure you picked up some
of that at your last job,

215
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,630
but I guess your studying really paid off.

216
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:41,965
Well done.

217
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,678
I helped the Defense Force!

218
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,434
I'll go neutralize all the corpses
of the defeated Yoju!

219
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,103
I'll do everything I can,
no matter what it is,

220
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:59,900
until I reach Mina's side!

221
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:04,946
What?

222
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,823
Looks like they've started
for the day too.

223
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:10,327
Honju has reached the designated
combat initiation point.

224
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,246
JGSDF ground and air forces
are requested to withdraw.

225
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,417
The Defense Force will initiate
an attack on the Honju's legs.

226
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:21,671
Please keep it pinned
down as long as you can.

227
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,514
Target sighted.

228
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,559
Compensation for Coriolis force,
gravitational force complete.

229
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,354
No additional targets in area.

230
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,439
One round loaded and ready to fire.

231
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,523
Roger.

232
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,943
All conditions met for firing to commence.

233
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,653
You are cleared to fire.

234
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:48,156
Let's see who can be
a cooler Defense Force officer!

235
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,242
Kafka-kun...

236
00:15:51,952 --> 00:15:55,205
This is who I am right now.

237
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,889
Unleashed combat power, 96%.

238
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:16,393
Watch this one closely, Kafka.

239
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,936
Fire.

240
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:36,496
That's the power of the person
you're trying to stand beside.

241
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,251
Second round loaded and ready to fire.

242
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,253
Roger. You are cleared to fire.

243
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,347
Honju vital signs have disappeared.

244
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:55,598
It's collapsing!

245
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,944
Third round loaded and ready to fire.

246
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,237
R-Roger.

247
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,572
You are cleared to fire.

248
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,874
The Honju has taken critical damage
and has stopped moving entirely.

249
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,335
That's the captain for you.

250
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,672
Fourth round loaded and ready to fire.

251
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,135
B-But the Honju is already down...

252
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,595
Give the order.

253
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:35,013
R-Roger.

254
00:17:37,348 --> 00:17:38,933
Damn it!

255
00:17:39,017 --> 00:17:42,520
It's totally different from when you look
at it on TV or through binoculars!

256
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,273
She's incredible!

257
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:47,358
Feel like giving up?

258
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:57,035
Standing by her side means matching
that kind of strength.

259
00:17:57,118 --> 00:18:01,289
And can you do that, Vice-Captain Hoshina?

260
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,335
-Not a chance!
-Not a chance?!

261
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,047
My unleashed combat power isn't as good
when it comes to the long-range guns,

262
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,092
so I'm not as capable of
taking down the big boys as she is.

263
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,553
But when it comes to the smaller
and mid-sized enemies...

264
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:18,389
Vice-Captain! Behind you!

265
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,272
I think I'm a bit better than she is.

266
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,859
A katana?

267
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,612
It was so fast I couldn't see it at all!

268
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,826
My family's been a clan of Kaiju-hunters
since the days of the Muromachi period.

269
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,869
I'm much better at this stuff.

270
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:46,376
A captain and vice-captain are
the force's most powerful members.

271
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,213
We each get special equipment
tailored to our fighting styles.

272
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,177
Hoshina, the Honju's down.

273
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,345
Roger.

274
00:18:57,428 --> 00:19:00,765
That's enough chatting.
The real show's about to start.

275
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,893
But she just said she
took down the Honju...

276
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:05,562
I told you during the briefing.

277
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,940
The problem is
the countless Yoju it creates.

278
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,695
We killed the Honju, but the Yoju
are still alive inside its corpse...

279
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,906
Just like I thought.

280
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,575
Here they come.

281
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,413
And are going to come swarming out.

282
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:38,219
All right, guys! We're wrapping up here.

283
00:19:38,887 --> 00:19:40,638
Once we're done cleaning up the riff-raff,

284
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,807
we can all go home
and have a yummy breakfast.

285
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:46,728
Cleaning up the riff-raff?
He makes it sound so easy.

286
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,273
Wimpin' out already, recruits?

287
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,483
Looks like you need to
work on your stamina!

288
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,360
All right, guys!

289
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:58,531
Let's show them that there's more to
fighting than your unleashed combat power!

290
00:19:58,615 --> 00:19:59,574
Right!

291
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,618
Hey, you two.

292
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,453
Platoon Leader Nakanoshima.

293
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:07,874
You're free to rest and let
the veterans do the work, you know.

294
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,209
What'll it be?

295
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,796
We'll fight, obviously!

296
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:17,508
DEPLOYED OFFICERS STATUS

297
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,428
The new recruits are tired.

298
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,514
Their unleashed combat power
and endurance are both falling.

299
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:27,393
It's a big neutralization to have
for their first mission.

300
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:31,898
But if they can make it through this,
it'll take them to the next level.

301
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,068
Most officers end their careers with

302
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:40,949
unleashed combat power
topping out at around 20% to 30%,

303
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:46,704
but a very small number of them will
overcome that wall and become captains.

304
00:20:47,372 --> 00:20:49,499
Right now, the only one
of the new recruits

305
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,209
to reach that level is Kikoru Shinomiya.

306
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:53,211
But there might be one more...

307
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,677
I think Reno Ichikawa
might be up for it as well.

308
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,264
Damn it.

309
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:08,226
I spent five years in technical
college training every day!

310
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:11,771
Why can't I keep up with him?

311
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,065
Iharu-kun.

312
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,693
I don't think
there are any more Yoju here.

313
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,028
Yeah, looks like you're right.

314
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,532
New Yoju entering Sector Foxtrot.

315
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,201
They're here. Let's return
to the front lines.

316
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,286
Right.

317
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,258
Monster Sweeper Inc.?

318
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,844
What's one of the cleaners doing out here?

319
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:46,014
Hey, you didn't hear the alarm?

320
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,266
The cleanup crew
won't be needed until later.

321
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:52,437
Aw, this one's no good either.

322
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,773
The reproductive organs I loaded them with
have been destroyed.

323
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,735
How did they find out?

324
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,406
Maybe there's somebody on the force
who knows all about Kaiju?

325
00:22:06,868 --> 00:22:08,745
You guys know anything?
