1
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:09,719
CP, this is Alpha 2.

2
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,847
Nothing unusual to report at Point 1.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,807
Alpha 2, this is CP.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,018
Continue your observation mission.

5
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:32,825
An emergency Kaiju alert
has just been issued. I repeat...

6
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:36,829
Stay calm and head for the shelter!

7
00:00:36,912 --> 00:00:41,333
...and Isogo wards in Yokohama City,
Kanagawa Prefecture.

8
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:46,213
Citizens in the designated areas are
to seek refuge in a shelter immediately.

9
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:51,052
The epicenter's projected route is...

10
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:59,226
Target is currently en route
from Yatobashi to Yamashita-cho.

11
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:03,898
Its estimated body length is 60 meters.
Fortitude 3.5. Over.

12
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:17,411
No one on thermals
within a 3 kilometer radius.

13
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,746
Roger.

14
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,664
All units, open fire.

15
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:23,000
I repeat. Open fire.

16
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:25,878
Roger. Luring target to the TO.

17
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:27,671
Fire.

18
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:35,596
Will we succeed in getting its attention?

19
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,848
Which division will come, you think?

20
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,226
Since this is Yokohama,
it'll be the Third Division.

21
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:01,974
Man, they got its guts over everything!

22
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:06,854
Looks like it'll be overtime
for me for a while.

23
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,316
Okay, time to get to work.

24
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:12,318
Yes, sir!

25
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,698
The members of the Third Division
have successfully defeated the Kaiju,

26
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,659
and they return to
raucous cheers from the citizens.

27
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,622
They have once again taken down
a Kaiju with no casualties.

28
00:03:25,206 --> 00:03:26,624
I heard Captain Ashiro is here!

29
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,125
She's so awesome!

30
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:32,630
These cheers are a sign
of the people's gratitude!

31
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,466
Hey, get some footage of the victims, too.

32
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,842
Oh, sorry.

33
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:39,094
Come give me a report when you're done!

34
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:40,304
Sure.

35
00:03:55,778 --> 00:04:00,741
After all the other battles
are over, our battle begins.

36
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,536
Nobody's here to cheer us on.

37
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,498
Nobody's particularly grateful, anyway.

38
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,418
But this is our...

39
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,968
unsung battle against the Kaiju.

40
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:19,885
KAFKA HIBINO

41
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:23,722
Kafka, Izumo Tech says they want a sample.

42
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:26,392
Thanks.

43
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,895
I can't cut through this!
The fat's jamming the saw!

44
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,438
Bring me the heat chainsaw!

45
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,982
Sure.

46
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,651
Hey, don't start lifting that yet!

47
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,158
Ow...

48
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,661
Over here! Bring a stretcher!

49
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,497
Don't worry. It only got on your skin.

50
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,833
I've had it happen to me a bunch of times.

51
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,584
Make sure you file for workers' comp!

52
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:53,752
Will do!

53
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:58,132
Things always get messy
when the Third Division's involved.

54
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,883
Hard to tell what's organs and what's not.

55
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:06,265
Anyway... do they really expect us
to finish this by the end of the week?

56
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,603
Kafka, got a new job for you.

57
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:13,397
We have an opening elsewhere on-site.

58
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,356
Where?

59
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,317
The intestines.

60
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,115
I've already got permission
from management.

61
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,200
Have fun!

62
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:29,204
I've heard people talking about it,
but is intestine work that bad?

63
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:32,916
Think about what's in those
intestines, and then you tell me.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,959
HOW THE BODY WORKS

65
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,545
Every time you get stuck
on intestine duty...

66
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,799
it takes a while before
you're ready to eat again.

67
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,436
I'm so tired!

68
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,190
That baby panda was so cute!

69
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,858
I can't wait to see it grown up!

70
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,694
I can still smell it...

71
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,905
And now, tonight's feature story.

72
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,867
Today, the Kaiju that appeared
in Yokohama was defeated

73
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,789
thanks to the heroic efforts of
the Defense Force's Third Division.

74
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:17,086
And the division's leader is none
other than the famous Captain Mina Ashiro.

75
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:21,673
Not only is she a captain
at the young age of 27,

76
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:25,969
she's also defeated several hundred Kaiju.

77
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,556
Let's wipe out all the Kaiju together!

78
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:33,602
Yeah.

79
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:42,403
Her cool, elegant demeanor makes her
the most popular of all the captains!

80
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,322
They say she's in the running
to be corps commander, too.

81
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:47,783
She's definitely one to keep an eye on.

82
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,712
How'd I wind up on this side of things?

83
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,924
Just don't think about it!

84
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:08,220
Cleaning up is an important job!
I'm helping society!

85
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:13,183
I get to live in a nice apartment
and eat whatever I want!

86
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,812
Isn't that good enough?

87
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:26,488
God, my head hurts...

88
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,907
It's because of that damn news story.

89
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,624
Morning...

90
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,835
Oh, good, you're here! Kafka!

91
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,919
Come here for a second!

92
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,089
-I'll go get things ready.
-Thanks.

93
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:45,924
Morning, Kafka.

94
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:50,220
We've got a new part-timer starting today.
This is Ichikawa-kun.

95
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,014
He says he's aiming
to join the Defense Force!

96
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:52,931
RENO ICHIKAWA

97
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,311
This guy was once like you!

98
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,856
He gave up, though, and now
he's part of the furniture here!

99
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,858
Well, this sucks...

100
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,903
Toku-san...
You're freaking the new kid out.

101
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,112
Why?

102
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,116
Why'd you give up?

103
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,082
I did do my best, you know, but...

104
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,627
No matter how good you are,
there's always somebody better.

105
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,631
I guess you could say I reached
the limit of how far I could go?

106
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,841
You'll understand when you're older.

107
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:28,759
I won't.

108
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,054
'Cause I'll never give up.

109
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,014
So I won't know until the day I die.

110
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,225
Not that I'd even want to.

111
00:08:37,935 --> 00:08:39,102
I'll go change.

112
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:44,816
Huh... I thought you
and him would get along.

113
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,944
That's not fair!

114
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:51,156
There's nothing I could've said
that wouldn't make me sound like a loser!

115
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,786
Is giving up that bad?

116
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,458
-Hey!
-Okay, let's get started.

117
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,379
Miike's team can stay
on bone cleaning duty.

118
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,548
Get the important ones ready
for Izumo Tech.

119
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:08,465
On it!

120
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,926
Yoshimura's team can start
taking apart the legs.

121
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:11,969
Dump all of it.

122
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,011
Okay.

123
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:14,555
New kid, you're on intestines.

124
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:15,931
-Follow me.
-Yes, sir.

125
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,141
Hah! That's what you get!

126
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,810
You too, Kafka. Follow me.

127
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,061
Me too?!

128
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,397
Two days in a row!

129
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,315
You're good with intestine work, though.

130
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,319
Damn it! Fine, I'll do it!

131
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:34,032
He complains, but he never says no.

132
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,412
He would've done a great job
in the Defense Force if he'd passed.

133
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,001
You serious?

134
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,131
Yeah, he's definitely feeling it.

135
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,802
And so am I.

136
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,804
You...

137
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,558
Is that lunch box
all the food you brought?

138
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,019
I don't feel up to eating it.

139
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,146
Yeah, I bet.

140
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,939
Here.

141
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,024
What?

142
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:11,278
You can have it.

143
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,155
You need to get something in your stomach,

144
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,948
or you won't last the afternoon.

145
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,533
I'm fine...

146
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:17,951
And these. You can have these, too.

147
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,786
These help a lot.

148
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,042
I can't understand what you're saying,
but I really don't need those.

149
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:28,503
Quit playing coy
and put them in your nose!

150
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,256
Stop it! Senpai, really...

151
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,008
Yeah, everybody's like
that their first time.

152
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,278
You're all responsible
for carrying your own stuff.

153
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,280
Good work today!

154
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:56,406
Good work today.

155
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,116
See you tomorrow.

156
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,369
Sure, goodnight.

157
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:07,084
Well, at least the smelliest
part of the job is over.

158
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,009
Senpai.

159
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,513
Oh, Ichikawa.

160
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:23,558
What, did you come to get back
at me for what I did at lunch?

161
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,018
Thanks to you...

162
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,355
Thanks to you, I made
it through my first day.

163
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,067
Thank you.

164
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:35,987
S-Sure...

165
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:38,949
That's all.

166
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,201
Goodnight.

167
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,414
Oh, and...

168
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:49,084
They're raising the age limit to 32.

169
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,378
For applicants to the Defense Force.

170
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,133
Not enough young people anymore,
apparently.

171
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,594
I can't tell you what to do
with your life, of course...

172
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:06,101
But when you talked about giving up,
you looked so sad.

173
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:10,021
Of course, I really don't care at all.

174
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:14,192
So if I'm wrong, you can just give up
and I won't care.

175
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,152
Goodnight!

176
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:17,696
Ichikawa!

177
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,533
Thanks.

178
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,287
You're a lot nicer
than I thought you were.

179
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:28,373
I told you, I really don't——

180
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,425
Senpa——

181
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,267
A Yoju?

182
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:52,522
Ichikawa, run!

183
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,524
Get as far away from here as you can!

184
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,861
Once you're sure you're safe, call it in!

185
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:59,446
You can't fight this thing alone!

186
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,781
Another body won't make any difference!

187
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,200
You want to join the Defense Force, right?

188
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:06,453
So why would you let
yourself get killed here?!

189
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:19,758
Over here! I'm the one you want!

190
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,454
There!

191
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,421
Whew!

192
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,257
Now it can't follow me...

193
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,930
Damn it all!

194
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,865
It's all gone...

195
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,325
Your place, my place, our school...

196
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:28,869
Yeah...

197
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:31,079
I'll get you for this, Kaiju!

198
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,790
I was so close to beating Guramon!

199
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,167
That's what you're sad about?

200
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:47,554
I'm sad that Miiko died.

201
00:14:49,306 --> 00:14:52,225
Miiko, your calico cat?

202
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,369
I'm going to join the Defense Force!

203
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:15,749
That's dumb. You're just a little kid!

204
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,959
You're in elementary school too, Kafka!

205
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:18,877
FOR MIIKO
KAFKA, MINA

206
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:24,883
All right...

207
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,387
Let's see who can be
a cooler Defense Force officer!

208
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,641
Let's wipe out all the Kaiju together!

209
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,728
Damn it all!

210
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,271
It wasn't supposed to be like this!

211
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:44,486
Damn it...

212
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,575
I ain't afraid of you, Kaiju!

213
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,538
Aim for the leg...

214
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,248
Aim...

215
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,881
How did it come to this?

216
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,301
Let's see who can be
a cooler Defense Force officer!

217
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,207
Ichikawa...

218
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:42,669
You idiot!

219
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:43,712
Why?

220
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,046
I called it in!

221
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,340
That's not what I meant!

222
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,721
If I left you to die here...

223
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:57,183
I'd never make it in the Defense Force!

224
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,561
WE REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT...

225
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,231
Damn it...

226
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,483
JAPAN DEFENSE FORCE
RECRUITING NOW

227
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,652
Damn it...

228
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,780
Damn it.

229
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,492
I'm so powerless...

230
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,703
Nothing's changed at all!

231
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,498
I can't protect anything.
Not my game console, or my friend's cat...

232
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,751
Or even the new kid at my job!

233
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:28,381
Damn it!

234
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,355
Target down.

235
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:45,982
We have wounded.

236
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,069
Initiating rescue operations.

237
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,031
Igarashi. Takaragi.
Take care of the wounded.

238
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,032
ANTI-KAIJU DEFENSE FORCE THIRD DIVISION

239
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,117
Everyone else, follow me.

240
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,286
We'll check the area for any other Yoju.

241
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,918
You okay?

242
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,045
Don't move. Just stay there.

243
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,201
Mina's incredible...

244
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,830
She took down that scary
thing in less than a second...

245
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:48,378
She's left me in the dust.

246
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,255
Senpai!

247
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,925
Y-Yeah?

248
00:18:55,677 --> 00:19:00,390
When that Kaiju showed up
and you told me to run away...

249
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,977
If you hadn't saved my life then,

250
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,230
I would've died today.

251
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:10,817
You were so cool.

252
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:16,614
Let's see who can be
a cooler Defense Force officer!

253
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,953
You really should think
about joining the Defense Force.

254
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:27,876
I mean, it's your call. Not my problem.

255
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:31,838
Yeah...

256
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:36,801
I can't just keep running forever!

257
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,848
Thanks, Ichikawa.

258
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:45,685
You really are a nice guy.

259
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:50,106
I don't think there's anything
wrong with giving up...

260
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,068
But it's not good to lie to yourself.

261
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,572
I'm going to give
the Defense Force another go——

262
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,877
Found you.

263
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,503
A Kai... A Kai——

264
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,382
Senpai?

265
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,472
Are your wounds bothering you?

266
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,226
Senpai!

267
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,369
What?!

268
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,205
Ichikawa! It's me! It's me!

269
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:49,791
Don't freak out like that, please!

270
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,964
AH.

271
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,590
He's calling you in.

272
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,425
Let's get out of here, Senpai!

273
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:06,849
EPISODE 1: THE MAN WHO BECAME A KAIJU

274
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:44,447
If you encounter a Kaiju,
the first thing you do is target the legs.

275
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,117
You bind it so it can't move...

276
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,120
I get a little scared.

277
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:52,747
Of what?

278
00:22:53,373 --> 00:22:57,627
When I imagine fighting a Kaiju
that's so much bigger than I am.

279
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,424
Don't worry!

280
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:07,136
Whenever you get scared...

281
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:11,474
I'll always be right by your side!

282
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:16,938
Liar.

283
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,653
Yes?

284
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:27,782
A Kaiju has appeared at
Yokohama South General Hospital?

285
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:29,742
Yes.

286
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:32,495
No.

287
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,080
It's fine.

288
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,749
I'll get my team ready,

289
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:38,876
and we'll eliminate it.
