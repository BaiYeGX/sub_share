1
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:33,344
This time, I'm not giving up,
no matter what!

2
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,972
EPISODE 4: FORTITUDE 9.8

3
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:38,182
Ow...

4
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:39,975
Senpai, are you okay?

5
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:46,065
See? I can still stand!

6
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:49,235
He just stood up on his broken leg, right?

7
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,779
Well, if that's your choice.

8
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:54,865
If I think it looks bad, I'm turning
the remote shield on, okay?

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,910
Fine by me!

10
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:05,167
Ichikawa, don't worry about me. Go on.

11
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,460
We had a deal, right?

12
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,462
If something happens to me, you can...

13
00:02:09,547 --> 00:02:11,340
I'll back you up.

14
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:12,967
Let's do the best we can.

15
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,558
Ichikawa...

16
00:02:21,934 --> 00:02:25,563
That's just who you are, isn't it?

17
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,857
All right, if you insist!

18
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,486
Are these guys for real?

19
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,366
Let's go, Ichikawa!

20
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:40,661
By our powers combined!

21
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:43,205
Everyone's staring at me,
and I'm really embarrassed!

22
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,374
You can be our legs!

23
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,419
Use the suit's power to help you!

24
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,297
The broken bone hurts like hell, but...

25
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,217
Use all your knowledge
to handle attacking!

26
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:56,468
Right!

27
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,347
C-Can we just pass these guys?

28
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:01,599
They'll be comic relief!

29
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,641
Take your job seriously!

30
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,477
Follow Kikoru and don't worry about me!

31
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,687
Hurry!

32
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,272
Got it!

33
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,274
Hang on tight!

34
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,111
He's so damn fast!

35
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,993
I'm gonna get there first!

36
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:21,952
Eat my dust.

37
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,293
Get ready so you can support
her once we catch up!

38
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,128
Right! Leave it to me!

39
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:49,021
She's not even letting us help her, huh?

40
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:08,791
Number 2016 has taken down
the last Yoju in Area Delta,

41
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,001
and is now engaging the Honju!

42
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,565
Last one.

43
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,840
T-The Honju has been destroyed.

44
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:01,218
The final stage of the exam is complete!

45
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,470
Recovering drones.

46
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,014
Good work, everyone.

47
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:12,021
That girl is just too goddamn fast!

48
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,111
COMBINATION UNDONE

49
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:23,240
While we bring back the drones,

50
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:25,159
we also need to send medics
for the injured.

51
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:27,661
Right, Vice-Captain Hoshina?

52
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,372
Huh? Oh.

53
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,791
That was even faster than I thought.

54
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,586
It was so much work
to set this all up, too.

55
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:39,757
Kikoru Shinomiya's even more
powerful than the rumors say.

56
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,301
So she's enough
to catch even your eye, huh?

57
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,512
I'd imagined we'd see
about thirty people drop out.

58
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:46,472
But nobody did.

59
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,182
And with only minimal injuries.

60
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:53,062
And it's clearly all thanks to her.

61
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,857
That's what you'd expect to see
from Director Shinomiya's daughter.

62
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,818
She'll be a big shot in the Defense Force
someday, that's for sure.

63
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,488
And a ray of hope for this country.

64
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:17,628
I was perfect, wasn't I, Daddy?

65
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:26,136
Now, time to go back and laugh
at Kafka Hibino a fourth time...

66
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:43,237
Kikoru Shinomiya was every bit
the monster everybody said she was, right?

67
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,363
Yeah.

68
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:48,283
She sure showed me up,
just like she said she would.

69
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:52,413
But thanks to her, we made it to the end.

70
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:53,997
Now we just wait for the results.

71
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,666
Yes...

72
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,792
What?

73
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,422
What's going on?

74
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,298
Senpai, let's get out of here!

75
00:07:11,974 --> 00:07:13,809
I was barely able to protect my heart

76
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,103
by focusing my entire shield
on a single point.

77
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,605
I can still fight!

78
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,779
What the hell are you?

79
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:28,782
You're still moving?

80
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,535
It can talk?!

81
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:39,126
What's going on with that skin of yours?

82
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,588
There, there. I'll let you handle this.

83
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,465
It's a Kaiju, but it's intelligent!

84
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,883
What's going on?

85
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:46,967
Die!

86
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,220
Make sure you chew before you swallow.

87
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:57,478
Something's wrong!

88
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,772
Abnormalities detected in 2016's vitals!

89
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:03,150
What's going on?
What's happening out there?

90
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,651
I don't know!

91
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:09,948
But we're picking up live signals
from the Kaiju they already killed!

92
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:12,534
What?

93
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:15,245
Those Kaiju shouldn't be able to
come back to life like that...

94
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,664
We have an estimated fortitude
for the revived Honju!

95
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:18,832
It's 6.4!

96
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,418
It's more powerful now?

97
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,004
You'd need a whole company to handle that.

98
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,132
The only ones here capable of taking
that thing down fast would be...

99
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,760
Activate remote shields for all examinees.

100
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,677
Yes, ma'am!

101
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:33,138
Send back some of the drones
and get me a camera feed.

102
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,890
Hoshina, we're heading out there.

103
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,392
...me or her.

104
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,061
Roger.

105
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,190
Emergency. Emergency.

106
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:46,318
Examinees are to immediately
evacuate to the nearest shelter.

107
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:50,989
I say again: examinees are to immediately
evacuate to the nearest shelter.

108
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:55,410
Evacuate?

109
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:58,539
I can't evacuate...

110
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,042
If somebody doesn't stop this thing,

111
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,045
lots of people will die!

112
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:08,215
Stop the bleeding
with Kaiju muscle fibers.

113
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,177
I can still move. I can still fight!

114
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,888
When I'm on the battlefield,

115
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,057
nobody dies!

116
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,978
Be perfect, for the sake
of this nation's future!

117
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,940
I need to be perfect!

118
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,164
I won't lose...

119
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,667
Kikoru-chan, you're amazing!

120
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,129
Your name's at the very top!

121
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,922
That means you're number one, right?

122
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:52,593
Yes! I was the top scorer!

123
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,469
Wow!

124
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,429
Risa.

125
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:56,930
Daddy!

126
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:59,099
Congratulations on passing, Risa.

127
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,561
Don't pat me on the head like that,
Daddy! It's embarrassing!

128
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,397
I'll buy you that present,
just like I promised.

129
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,190
Really? Hooray!

130
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,525
Bye, Kikoru-chan!

131
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,737
Let's go get yakiniku
to celebrate your hard work!

132
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,864
I told you
there was nothing to worry about.

133
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,116
I always had faith in you, son!

134
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,494
Kikoru-sama.

135
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,582
The master will be home today.

136
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:27,502
I'm sure he'll be quite pleased.

137
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,421
Yeah!

138
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,426
You got the top score?

139
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,304
Of course you did. Who cares?

140
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,975
Rejoicing over a single success
will only lead to failure next time.

141
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,520
Get ready for your next goal immediately.

142
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,398
Kikoru.

143
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:55,322
Always be perfect,
for the sake of this nation's future!

144
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,367
And for your late mother's sake, as well.

145
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:02,287
Yes, sir...

146
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:06,500
I won't lose!

147
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,086
Never stop moving forward!

148
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,712
I can still fight!

149
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,673
Never let anyone be better than you!

150
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,553
Even with one arm,
as long as it can move, I can...

151
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,057
Be more powerful than anyone
else on the battlefield!

152
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,893
I can still fight!

153
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,815
No...

154
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:41,702
Honju sighted!

155
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:44,079
Kikoru Shinomiya is nearby, and injured!

156
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,792
The Honju's severed
offensive uniorgan has regenerated!

157
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,294
It's condensing energy for an attack!

158
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,754
Crap...

159
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:53,964
Will we make it in time?

160
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,471
I'm done for...

161
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,607
I'm sorry, Daddy.

162
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:19,698
I couldn't be perfect.

163
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:22,617
I'm sorry.

164
00:12:27,539 --> 00:12:30,000
You did a great job, Kikoru!

165
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:34,045
What are you doing here?

166
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:51,855
Because you worked so hard,
everybody was able to evacuate!

167
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,860
Now leave the rest to me!

168
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,453
What the hell was that explosion?

169
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,370
Damn it!

170
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,539
Get a move on!

171
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,416
Get your asses into the shelter!

172
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,504
A signal flare?

173
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,881
-You can run there, right?
-Y-Yeah.

174
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,761
He's guiding our evacuation, huh?

175
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:25,555
That's why he's the JGSDF's rising star!

176
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,558
Kafka-senpai...

177
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,939
Senpai, let's get out of here!

178
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,649
The Honju came back to life!

179
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,025
Don't head that way!

180
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,652
Shinomiya is fighting it right now!

181
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,195
I told HQ!

182
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,905
Everyone get out of here! That's an order!

183
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,324
Senpai, you heard that, right?

184
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,619
He's already gone!

185
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:51,873
He's not going to transform, right?

186
00:13:51,957 --> 00:13:53,625
He's not, right?

187
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,255
If he turns into a Kaiju right now,
he'll be killed for sure.

188
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:01,341
No, he'll do it!

189
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:03,718
At times like this,
he doesn't hesitate at all...

190
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:07,639
What?

191
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,225
What's going on?

192
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,354
You're a Kaiju?

193
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:16,898
Kikoru.

194
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:19,609
Please! Please!

195
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,820
Please don't tell
the Defense Force about this!

196
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,656
Please!

197
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,667
I'll tell you more in a bit.

198
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,128
I only need a sec
to kick this thing's ass.

199
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,838
So just relax and get some rest.

200
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:45,427
I'm detecting a mysterious ultra-powerful
energy source near the Honju!

201
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,345
It might be a new Kaiju!

202
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,555
Another one?

203
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,723
Do we have visual?

204
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,975
The explosion knocked out
our comms network.

205
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,226
We do not have visual.

206
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,521
Wait, is this number right?

207
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,649
Fortitude 9.8?

208
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,942
Impossible.

209
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:03,528
The blast must've scrambled
the measurement system.

210
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,614
R-Right?

211
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:10,368
Otherwise it'd be one of
the most powerful Daikaiju in history!

212
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,714
Sorry. I'm running out of time here.

213
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,549
So I'm cleaning you up...

214
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,722
with one punch!

215
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,134
Let's see you
come back to life after that!

216
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,015
N-No! Just kidding!

217
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,726
Please don't come back to life!

218
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:23,024
Don't scare me like that!

219
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,610
Who is this guy?

220
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:32,575
A Yoju?

221
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,454
Looks like you'll be okay.

222
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,668
I'm glad you're safe!

223
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,008
But let me say one thing.

224
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,428
You can't put yourself
in danger like that!

225
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:53,763
You too!

226
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,433
Ichikawa! What are you doing here?

227
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,101
You ran off while my back was turned,

228
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,478
and sure enough,
I find you here, transformed!

229
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:04,441
I was thinking maybe I could
just transform a part of my body.

230
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,693
But when I saw the Honju
I was like, "No way!"

231
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,945
You need to be more careful!

232
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,365
Shinomiya!

233
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,372
Ashiro and Hoshina have
arrived at the scene.

234
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,542
What is this?

235
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,128
What would you have to do to cause this?

236
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,842
I've seen this before somewhere...

237
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:34,846
Captain Ashiro, I can't
find any of the examinees.

238
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,931
This is the operation room.

239
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,894
An additional three examinees
have arrived at Shelter 6.

240
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:45,732
It's Kikoru Shinomiya,
Reno Ichikawa, and Kafka Hibino.

241
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,901
They're safe, huh?

242
00:17:48,443 --> 00:17:51,571
All examinees are now accounted for.

243
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:52,614
Roger.

244
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,368
I'll admit that
Kikoru Shinomiya is strong,

245
00:17:57,452 --> 00:17:59,537
but she can't have done this...

246
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:04,667
The Kaiju coming back to life,
and then this blast zone...

247
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,086
There's a lot we don't understand.

248
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,881
Bring in an investigation unit
and a disposal unit.

249
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,675
Hoshina and I will wipe out
the remaining Yoju.

250
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:13,635
Roger.

251
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:19,849
It's like what we saw three months ago...

252
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,727
Are they linked in some way?

253
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:27,899
I'm glad to see you're not
as badly hurt as I thought.

254
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,609
I'm back in the hospital...

255
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,821
Shinomiya's condition
is looking good, too.

256
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:36,116
They're using the Defense Force's
best tech to treat her, supposedly.

257
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:39,410
Why does she get better treatment?
Let me in on that!

258
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,370
Ow!

259
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,123
'Cause you only have a few fractures.

260
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,251
It was all over so fast.

261
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,213
It's been ages since I went up
against people so incredible,

262
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,673
and it reminded me...

263
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:57,428
Chasing your dreams means
there's always someone out there

264
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:01,891
who's beating you
at the thing you care about most.

265
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,685
Senpai...

266
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:09,190
But it's also so exciting
that you don't really care!

267
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,359
It helped me remember that!

268
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:13,987
And I have you to thank
for encouraging me.

269
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,780
Thanks, Ichikawa.

270
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,494
Captain Ashiro?

271
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:24,122
What are you doing here?

272
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,417
I'm told you carried
Shinomiya to the shelter.

273
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,212
Thank you for your help in rescuing her.

274
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,756
Goodbye.

275
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:35,884
Mi...

276
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,469
No, not yet.

277
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,516
I'll talk to her
after I become an officer!

278
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,440
Just watch me, Mina!

279
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,785
Daddy, I couldn't be perfect...

280
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,123
I...

281
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,044
Daddy?

282
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,465
Oh, just stay there.

283
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,843
Vice-Captain Hoshina.

284
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,180
We dealt with all the Kaiju that revived.

285
00:20:22,764 --> 00:20:25,058
Fortunately, nobody was killed

286
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,685
thanks to you taking down the Honju.

287
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,024
Is that not what happened?

288
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,822
I'm glad you're safe!

289
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:47,622
No, I defeated that Kaiju.

290
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:52,502
KOKUBUNJI, TOKYO

291
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,212
During a Defense Force screening exam,

292
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:58,299
an unusual incident took place,
with Kaiju suddenly coming back to life.

293
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:02,011
There were several injuries during
the incident, but zero fatalities.

294
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:06,057
Zero? Zero?

295
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,769
No, no, no. No way there were zero.

296
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,855
Or is one of these
"Captain" people that strong?

297
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,817
Kaiju No. 8 remains at large...

298
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,361
No. 8? What?

299
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:25,034
Um... this is how
you answer a phone, right?

300
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,787
Hey, where've you been?

301
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,831
Breaktime's over, you know.

302
00:21:29,914 --> 00:21:30,957
Uh...

303
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,042
Don't you "uh" me. Get back here.

304
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,127
Right.

305
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,004
I'll be right back.

306
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,802
Sheesh.
Humans are so particular about time.

307
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:46,806
Sorry, sorry.

308
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,017
I had a bad case of diarrhea.

309
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,477
You had us all worried, you know?

310
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:55,523
Tell someone where you're going before
you hole up in the toilets, new kid.

311
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,609
Sorry, Toku-san.

312
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:01,779
Hey, I heard there was
an accident at the exam site.

313
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:02,739
Seriously?

314
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:03,823
Oops.

315
00:22:03,906 --> 00:22:06,617
Are Kafka and Ichikawa okay?

316
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,661
How careless of me.
