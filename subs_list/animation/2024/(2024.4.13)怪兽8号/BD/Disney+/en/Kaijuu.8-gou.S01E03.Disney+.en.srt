1
00:00:00,668 --> 00:00:02,003
Whatever.

2
00:00:02,086 --> 00:00:03,796
I'll move it myself.

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,214
That suit...

4
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:20,730
Wh-Who are you?

5
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,357
Examinee number 2016.

6
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,193
Kikoru Shinomiya.

7
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,112
My hobby is murdering Kaiju.

8
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,614
Remember that.

9
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,950
Shinomiya?

10
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,870
Old man...

11
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:38,914
Did you know you smell like a Kaiju?

12
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,626
W-We work in Kaiju disposal!

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,921
What's a pair of disposal workers
doing here?

14
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,301
Up you go...

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,305
Don't tell me
he's got his own private suit too!

16
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:58,809
Examinee number 2032. Kafka Hibino.

17
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,687
Remember the name, kiddo.

18
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,152
And he took my parking space
while we were talking!

19
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:10,154
Stupid helpful butler!

20
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,034
I was expecting
the exam to be a formality,

21
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:17,411
but this might actually be kind of fun.

22
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:23,250
I'm gonna show you up bad, Kafka Hibino.

23
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,337
Let's go, Sebasu.

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,505
Of course.

25
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:39,683
Didn't take you long to use your powers.

26
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:44,688
But wasn't it cool how I only transformed
the part she couldn't see?

27
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,690
That's not the issue!

28
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,943
Hey, we heard a loud noise.

29
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,069
Everything okay out here?

30
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:54,281
No, nothing! Everything's fine here!

31
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:55,616
Then get going.

32
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,867
Okay!

33
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:04,208
Next time you pull that stunt,
I'm sending you home.

34
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,378
Okay...

35
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:12,133
I gave up on this once...

36
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:16,428
But this is my last chance
to stand beside her!

37
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,604
This time, I ain't giving up!

38
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,409
EPISODE 3: REVENGE MATCH

39
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,912
Huh? What the hell is this?

40
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,540
I can't keep up at all!

41
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,418
I'd been keeping up my training
out of habit!

42
00:04:11,502 --> 00:04:14,588
And I do really hard
physical work every day!

43
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:18,926
The second round has two parts,
a fitness test and an aptitude test.

44
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:19,885
Yeah.

45
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:23,472
The aptitude test is something
you've either got or you don't.

46
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,932
Which means...

47
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:25,975
Yeah.

48
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:30,020
We want to get the best grades
we can in the fitness test.

49
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:37,945
Before, I used to be just below average!

50
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,948
But now...

51
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:51,542
Do you really get this weak
when you turn thirty?

52
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,672
If I used my power,

53
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,175
I wonder if I could
get to the front of the pack.

54
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,802
Damn it...

55
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,387
My body doesn't want to move at all!

56
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,097
KAFKA HIBINO
FITNESS TEST RANK:

57
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,350
219 OUT OF 225

58
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,310
KAFKA HIBINO

59
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,353
KIKORU SHINOMIYA

60
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,483
Well, it didn't take long to show you up.

61
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,570
Kafka Hibino.

62
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,323
Remember the name, kiddo.

63
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,616
Kiddo!

64
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:30,497
Forget it! Forget my name right now!

65
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,381
I feel so much better.

66
00:05:39,465 --> 00:05:43,427
You really didn't use
your Kaiju power, did you?

67
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,891
Everybody's put
in a lot of effort to get here.

68
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:52,686
It wouldn't be fair to use my power.

69
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,482
I thought it would be so cool to say that,
but I should've used it!

70
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,317
It's been ages
since I last tried this test!

71
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,904
I don't think that's the only
reason you got the ranking you did.

72
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,034
Here are the applicants this year.

73
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,328
A lot look pretty interesting.

74
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:14,083
Not that you care about anything
but killing Kaiju, I'm sure.

75
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,044
Continue.

76
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,754
I'll listen while I work.

77
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,756
Oh, that's rare.

78
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:25,844
The first person I've got my eye on is...

79
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,554
Haruichi Izumo.

80
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:28,472
Yeah. That's a good idea.

81
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,100
Graduated top of his class
from Tokyo Neutralization University.

82
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,184
HARUICHI IZUMO
FITNESS TEST RANK: 2ND

83
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,104
The most promising
of this year's group of new graduates.

84
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:37,648
Then there's Iharu Furuhashi,

85
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:42,736
a powerhouse valedictorian at Hachioji
Neutralization Technical College.

86
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,862
IHARU FURUHASHI
FITNESS TEST RANK: 3RD

87
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:45,489
Yes!

88
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,617
Aoi Kaguragi, the rising star of
the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force.

89
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,785
AOI KAGURAGI
FITNESS TEST RANK: 1ST

90
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:55,040
He turned down a sure spot in the JGSDF
elite to come to the Defense Force.

91
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,959
And that's not all.

92
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,794
There're more applicants

93
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,588
from neutralization universities
and colleges than most years.

94
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:05,092
Normally, these people would be trying
to become elite officers,

95
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,593
not field agents.

96
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,013
No wonder they all seemed so damn good...

97
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,434
And the big one
everybody's watching is her.

98
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:17,813
Graduated from California Neutralization
at age 16.

99
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:20,524
She skipped grades and became
the youngest ever to do so.

100
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,527
They call her the greatest talent ever.

101
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:25,988
Kikoru Shinomiya.

102
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,282
I'm gonna kick her ass.

103
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,286
Now, let's see if
I've got any hope against her.

104
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,913
Let's see what you've got.

105
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:37,291
It's a group
of extremely skilled applicants,

106
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,043
none more so than Kikoru Shinomiya.

107
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,379
So you...

108
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:44,047
So she's...

109
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,048
Oh?

110
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:49,094
Did you finally figure out
how awesome I am, Kafka Hibino?

111
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,680
I had no idea you were so amazing!

112
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,475
Don't touch the mistress!

113
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:56,935
Who the hell is that guy?

114
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,229
Some groupie of Shinomiya's?

115
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,152
Second time you got
shown up today, Kafka Hibino.

116
00:08:05,235 --> 00:08:08,405
Let's see how many more times
that'll happen today.

117
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:16,246
Well, I'm gonna show you up too!

118
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:24,087
I'm just about screwed, though.

119
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,006
There's still hope.

120
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,593
For the last two years,
the second part of today's test

121
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,304
has been Kaiju corpse disposal.

122
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:33,889
What?

123
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,724
They want to test knowledge of Kaiju,

124
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,768
as well as your ability
to work in a group.

125
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,229
And also make sure applicants realize that

126
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:42,856
there's more to the job
than just killing Kaiju.

127
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,485
That's why I chose to work in disposal
for my part-time job.

128
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:48,362
Okay!

129
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,322
Let's bet it all on the next part!

130
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,365
Right!

131
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,868
DEFENSE FORCE
TRAINING AREA TWO

132
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,870
It's huge.

133
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:02,084
I'm Third Division Vice-Captain Hoshina.

134
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,586
I'm the head of the exam committee
for round two this year.

135
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,837
THIRD DIVISION VICE-CAPTAIN
SOSHIRO HOSHINA

136
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:09,174
You'll be doing your aptitude test
here in this area.

137
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:19,393
Your task in this area will be
to find Kaiju and...

138
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,894
Dispose of their bodies!

139
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,854
...neutralize them!

140
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,569
Neutralize them?

141
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:08,317
What happened to disposing
of their bodies, Ichikawa-san?

142
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,902
I just said that's what it was
for the past two years!

143
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,070
I'm disappointed too!

144
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:16,950
But we can't send you in empty-handed,

145
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:19,870
so you'll be wearing these.

146
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:25,917
So this is Izumo Tech gear, huh?

147
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,545
The G-X4552, huh?

148
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,799
What is this?

149
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,676
Wow...

150
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,888
It's pressing itself up against my body...

151
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,558
Body measurements
and form assimilation complete.

152
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,770
Kaiju muscle fibers, fully operational.

153
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:50,067
It's becoming one with my body.

154
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,903
I can feel my muscles getting stronger!

155
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,488
It's hot...

156
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,989
So this is...

157
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:59,284
This is a Defense Force Kaiju combat suit.

158
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:02,037
It's made from organic material
taken from Kaiju,

159
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,832
and massively multiplies
the combat power of its wearer.

160
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:11,213
For now, there's no better weapon
you have against the Kaiju.

161
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:15,050
Measuring the unleashed combat power
of the ones who have their suits on.

162
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,677
Understood.

163
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,847
Reno Ichikawa. Unleashed combat power, 8%.

164
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:24,643
Haruichi Izumo, 18%.

165
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,728
Sounds about right, I guess.

166
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:29,189
Aoi Kaguragi, 15%.

167
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,107
Understood.

168
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,901
Iharu Furuhashi, 14%.

169
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:33,985
What?

170
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,404
Unleashed combat power indicates

171
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,782
how much of the suit's power
you've drawn out.

172
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,868
Even after training,
it's usually around 20%.

173
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:46,331
We're lucky to get one
applicant a year above 10%.

174
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:51,128
This year might be a bumper crop
like we've never seen before.

175
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,714
Seriously?

176
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,632
Kikoru Shinomiya...

177
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,300
Unleashed combat power,

178
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,219
46%!

179
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,145
She's already at the level
of a platoon leader.

180
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,814
The greatest talent in history...

181
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,817
This has to be a record for anybody
who hasn't officially joined yet.

182
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,944
Just 8%...

183
00:12:16,695 --> 00:12:19,448
Oh, there's no reason
to get down, Ichikawa-kun.

184
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:22,576
If you get an 8% on your first time,
you did well.

185
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,163
Honestly, if you don't have a zero
at this point, you pass.

186
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:29,791
And I've never even seen a zero!

187
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,168
Kafka Hibino...

188
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:33,170
Unleashed combat power,

189
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,713
0%!

190
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,050
What's wrong with him?

191
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,552
Wow, he's my first zero!

192
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:43,013
Huh? Are the measurements wrong?

193
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,432
Just give me a little more time!

194
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,392
I'm trying to squeeze it out!

195
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,979
You're not trying to take a dump!

196
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,148
You can't squeeze it out!

197
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:56,568
Wow, the old guy is hilarious!

198
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,028
I like him!

199
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,863
He probably won't pass, though.

200
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,865
Take your proctoring job seriously!

201
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,784
Why?

202
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:07,454
Damn it! There's got to be some trick!

203
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,081
I need to figure it out
before the exam ends!

204
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,960
You're pissing me off, Kafka Hibino.

205
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:17,589
Show the power I saw
in the parking lot already!

206
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,466
The exam's almost over!

207
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:26,223
Okay, now that you're all in your suits...

208
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:31,978
Let's start the final test.

209
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:38,276
DEFENSE FORCE SCREENING EXAM FINAL TEST

210
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,737
I'll explain the test.

211
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,406
Your targets are a Honju and 36 Yoju

212
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,203
that have been placed throughout
the urban training area.

213
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,957
These Kaiju caused sixteen fatalities
in Hachioji last year.

214
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,918
We captured them alive
to serve as training aids.

215
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:59,548
You're going to fight them
with anti-Kaiju weapons.

216
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:05,053
You'll all be tracked with a drone
that will monitor your actions.

217
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,640
If we decide your life is in danger,

218
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,852
we'll remotely activate
the shield on your suit,

219
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:15,647
but be aware this will mean you fail.

220
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:21,987
To be honest, I can't guarantee
you'll survive this next part.

221
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,991
Only if you're willing
to accept that, then

222
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,242
go.

223
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,126
What the hell?

224
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,971
Yoju 12 down.

225
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,726
Yoju 03 down.

226
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,729
Wow...

227
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,648
Damn it! Let's get going too!

228
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,901
Don't fall behind, Ichikawa!

229
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:02,694
That's my line!

230
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:06,823
This equipment is incredibly heavy
without the suit helping you!

231
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:09,409
Only I, the zero, can understand this!

232
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,161
Don't make it sound cool!

233
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,163
But what do we do?

234
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,916
We don't have
that kind of offensive power.

235
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,127
Oh, I forgot.

236
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:23,089
Captain Mina Ashiro is here
for the test as well.

237
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,675
Do your best to look good for her.

238
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:30,555
Let's see who can be
a cooler Defense Force officer!

239
00:15:31,181 --> 00:15:32,515
That's right...

240
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,935
Who cares if I'm a zero?

241
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:40,106
Calm down. This is your last chance.

242
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,275
Ichikawa.

243
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:47,989
Why are the examining officers
following us all with drones?

244
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:53,078
True... If all they cared about
was how many Kaiju you killed,

245
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,414
they could just track
that number with sensors.

246
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:57,499
Yup.

247
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,085
They're testing our abilities,

248
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,504
but also how we can adapt
to the situation.

249
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:07,467
Which means since we lack that kind
of offensive capability, we should...

250
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,760
Yup!

251
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,973
Support all the attackers as best we can!

252
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:13,974
Right!

253
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,396
Damn it!

254
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,856
Senpai! Engagement to our right!

255
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,317
Okay! Go around from the side
and provide support!

256
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,831
Those hooves...

257
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,000
I know this guy!

258
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,628
The one we did a joint disposal of
with Iida Cleaners!

259
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:49,384
So that's why they included
these in our equipment...

260
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:53,805
Eat this!

261
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,108
A stun grenade?

262
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:09,362
It's got weak eyesight
but incredibly good hearing!

263
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,866
Once you've deafened them,
they're easy targets!

264
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,701
The stomach!

265
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,829
The skin on its stomach
is weaker than most Kaiju!

266
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,622
Aim for the stomach!

267
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:20,874
What?

268
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,307
Thanks for the support, Shinomiya groupie!

269
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,392
I am not a groupie!

270
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,236
We did it, Senpai!

271
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,699
Yeah, we've taken apart more
Kaiju bodies than we can count!

272
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,453
We know you guys inside and out!

273
00:17:59,037 --> 00:17:59,954
I can do this!

274
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,707
I don't have to use my Kaiju power!

275
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,461
I'll make up for all my screw-ups!

276
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,421
I'll throw the next one!

277
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:09,964
Let's keep it up!

278
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,644
Another one?

279
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:27,982
Senpai!

280
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,319
Area Delta, Number 2032 injured.

281
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:34,572
Irregularities detected in vitals.
He's unable to continue combat.

282
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:37,575
Yoju 23 is continuing to approach.

283
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,577
Prepare the remote shield.

284
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,041
Ow...

285
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,376
Crap.

286
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,586
They're gonna put the shield up...

287
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,215
...but be aware this will mean you fail.

288
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,302
Stand up...

289
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,096
She's...

290
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,849
She's watching!

291
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:06,855
I can't embarrass myself
in front of her anymore!

292
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:08,857
Activating remote shield!

293
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,694
Figured he'd be the first to drop out.

294
00:19:13,278 --> 00:19:16,781
He was a funny guy... Too bad.

295
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,547
That's the third time, Kafka Hibino.

296
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:38,595
When I'm on the battlefield,
nobody gets to quit.

297
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,555
Kikoru! You saved me!

298
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:43,766
I'll go defeat the rest of them,

299
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,895
so you just lie on the ground
like a loser.

300
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,150
She's going after the main target?

301
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,651
I'll take it out first!

302
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,282
Better pay attention!

303
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,285
She's so much more powerful!

304
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,329
Is that really
the same equipment we've got?

305
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:08,124
So your unleashed combat power makes
that much of a difference, huh?

306
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,002
Damn it... I'll go too!

307
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:12,378
Senpai!

308
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,547
It's broken?

309
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,925
I can't stand up!

310
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,761
2032, can you hear me?

311
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,638
This is Hoshina in the operation room.

312
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,642
We're seeing irregularities
in your vitals.

313
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,561
Multiple fractures, probably.

314
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:32,315
Possibly organ damage.

315
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,235
No...

316
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,072
Do I have to give up?

317
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:42,784
No... while there's still a chance, I'll…

318
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:59,133
I'll never be able to stand by her side...

319
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:07,308
It's always the ones with talent who pass.

320
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,775
As the test proctor,
I recommend you drop out.

321
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,903
Even those shields aren't perfect.

322
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:25,076
I'm the one who decides

323
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,911
if I give up or not.

324
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,621
Senpai.

325
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,501
I'm too old for dreams...

326
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:43,011
I know I look like an idiot, but...

327
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:48,308
I've decided to bet
my whole life up to this point

328
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,228
and chase my dreams again!

329
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,108
This time...

330
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:01,988
This time, I'm not giving up,
no matter what!
