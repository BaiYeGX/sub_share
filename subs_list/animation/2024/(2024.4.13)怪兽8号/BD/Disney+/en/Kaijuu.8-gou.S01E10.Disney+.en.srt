1
00:00:01,752 --> 00:00:04,130
Target sighted.

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,636
You are my prey.

3
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:16,559
I-It's strong...

4
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:17,727
But that's not all.

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,439
It's... enjoying the fight.

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:26,652
A head-on battle against an opponent
whose strength rivals your own!

7
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,074
Rivals! Rivals! Rivals! Rivals!

8
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:36,996
Your core's a lot smaller than I thought.

9
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:42,710
Got him!

10
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,962
-That's the vice-captain for you!
-Not yet!

11
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,010
It got bigger?!

12
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:54,472
Its fortitude is rising
alongside the heat...

13
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:55,848
No way!

14
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:58,225
Fortitude...

15
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:01,270
9.0!

16
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:46,917
EPISODE 10: SECRET REVEALED

17
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,546
It's massive...

18
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,384
The vice-captain can't handle
something that size by himself.

19
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,521
The vice-captain?

20
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:09,899
Hibino-san?

21
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,997
Number Three: Return Slasher!

22
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,970
Your speed won't save you!

23
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,900
Incredible. He's still fighting it,
even after it transformed. But...

24
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,985
My blades aren't cutting
all the way through!

25
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,820
This is why I hate Giant Kaiju!

26
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,159
I'll just have to use my speed
to get to the core in its back.

27
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:03,911
It's the only way.

28
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,333
Exceeding operational limits.

29
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,961
-Cancel maximum release immediately.
-I'm overheating?

30
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,630
It's been ten minutes
since your maximum release!

31
00:04:14,713 --> 00:04:16,048
You have to shut it down!

32
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,180
So I'm down to one minute at best, huh?

33
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,524
It self-destructed?

34
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,489
That's just like a Kaiju.
Totally cold-blooded.

35
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:43,534
They're like living missiles! But...

36
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,120
It gave me a nice smoke screen.

37
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,295
Number Six!

38
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,770
Limit exceeded. Canceling maximum release.

39
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,524
Seek medical treatment immediately.

40
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,152
Vice-Captain...

41
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,989
Vice-Captain!

42
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:33,584
Two hundred years ago,
you would've been considered a genius.

43
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,671
But the era of blades has passed.

44
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,425
You understand that, right, Soshiro?

45
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,678
Give up on joining the Defense Force.

46
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:53,854
Vice-Captain! Vice-Captain!

47
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,230
Vice-Captain!

48
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,735
Don't worry... I'm still alive.

49
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,280
Ow...

50
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,533
I had my shields set to max...
That Kaiju hits like a truck.

51
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:18,754
I lost my maximum release.

52
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:20,547
So what now?

53
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,509
What can I do?

54
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:28,472
What's going on outside?

55
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,393
The civilians are almost fully evacuated.

56
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:35,854
We're turning the tide
against the Yoju, too.

57
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,906
Yeah? Good stuff.

58
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:51,161
Guess I'd better keep
fighting till the end, too.

59
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,414
But you can't fight like that!

60
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,586
Hoshina-Style Sword-Slay Technique
Number One: Air Slasher!

61
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,473
I've figured it out now.

62
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,601
You can't defeat me with those weapons.

63
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:19,982
You just figured that out?
I knew it from the start!

64
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:25,904
Give up, Soshiro.

65
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:29,700
Your unleashed combat power
with guns is low.

66
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:33,704
These days, that simply won't do.

67
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,457
Give up, Hoshina-kun.

68
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:41,295
We're seeing more
and more Giant Kaiju every year.

69
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,466
If all you can use is a blade,
you'll get yourself killed out there.

70
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:51,221
People have been telling me
that since I was a kid!

71
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,185
But she told me something else...

72
00:07:56,768 --> 00:08:01,190
Soshiro Hoshina, I'm told
you're a blade specialist.

73
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,358
Yes, that's right.

74
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,403
Here it comes...

75
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,030
"Give up."

76
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,948
I need your help.

77
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,953
Will you join my division, Hoshina?

78
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:20,334
We could easily find ourselves facing
small but powerful foes someday.

79
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:25,130
And I'm the opposite of you.
I can't use a blade at all.

80
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:27,966
I try not to even use kitchen knives.

81
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,726
When it's time for me to shoot my foe,

82
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,729
will you clear a path for me?

83
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:48,654
She left me in charge of the base.

84
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:51,949
I'll protect it if it kills me!

85
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,247
Number Two: Cross Slasher!

86
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,377
Number Three: Return Slasher!

87
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:10,217
Number Four: Wild Slasher!

88
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,847
Number Five: Mist Slasher!

89
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,433
Number Six!

90
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,858
Vice-Captain!

91
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,956
I don't have a choice!

92
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,208
No...

93
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:47,671
If he transforms here,
there really will be no escape!

94
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,172
No, Senpai!

95
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,758
I'm sorry, Ichikawa.

96
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:54,428
My comrades' lives are more important!

97
00:09:57,973 --> 00:09:59,558
Great work, everyone.

98
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:04,062
That voice...

99
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,273
Hey, Kaiju.

100
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,401
I win this fight.

101
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,665
I'm the vice-captain of the base.

102
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,629
My job's to pass the baton to her.

103
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,382
Okonogi. This is an emergency,
so I'm skipping the procedures.

104
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,300
Yes, ma'am!

105
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36,845
Time to blow this thing up.

106
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,536
It's regenerating fast!

107
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,705
Captain, the core is in the back!

108
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:06,583
Somewhere around the fourth
to sixth thoracic vertebrae!

109
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,085
Roger!

110
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,215
Damn it!

111
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,554
I guess it's not that easy...

112
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:24,184
Now, time to give it one more go...

113
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,689
Unleashed combat power, 63%.

114
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,691
Number Four: Wild Slasher!

115
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,322
I'll limit its mobility
to make it an easier target.

116
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,949
Number Two: Cross Slasher!

117
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:41,743
This is crazy!

118
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,162
Your suit's already past its limit!

119
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,043
It's regenerating...

120
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,883
My power output's too low. What do I do?

121
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:00,721
Shinomiya?

122
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:02,264
Water Skimmer!

123
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:08,353
Damn it... I'm not even strong
enough to scratch it yet?

124
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,938
Keep going, Shinomiya.

125
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,776
I'll cut open the shell,
then you chop into the wounds!

126
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,828
It worked!

127
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,289
Shinomiya!

128
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,007
Overheated?

129
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,759
That's fine, though.

130
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,093
You did well.

131
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,687
Core exposed!

132
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,357
You've got one bullet remaining, Captain!

133
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,237
Support the captain!

134
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:12,042
Vice-Captain! Sorry we're late!

135
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,337
Don't give it time to regenerate, guys!

136
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:33,730
Move.

137
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,232
Move.

138
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,534
Don't stop thinking!

139
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:47,577
Just five more seconds is enough...

140
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,956
Come on, move!

141
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,631
Slice. Slice.

142
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,383
Slice open a path!

143
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:06,096
That's the only way I have
to leave my mark!

144
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,648
Thank you, Hoshina.

145
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,569
I was right to make you my vice-captain.

146
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,365
Unleashed combat power, 96%.

147
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,202
Now it's time for me to shoot my foe.

148
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:38,962
You picked the wrong folks to mess with.

149
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,900
T-The Honju is down!

150
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,450
We did it.

151
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:09,409
Yeah.

152
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,412
Yes!

153
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,200
That's Captain Ashiro for you, huh?

154
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,452
I was right...

155
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:56,331
This is the Defense Force
I've wanted to be in since I was a kid.

156
00:15:56,957 --> 00:16:00,168
They're all so cool...

157
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:05,256
I want to stand right there
with them someday...

158
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,510
Your face is a mess.

159
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,222
What? How can you say that when
I'm having an emotional moment?!

160
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,682
You've got a heart of stone!

161
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,727
We're just getting started.

162
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,230
Let's do our best, too.

163
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:25,527
Yeah.

164
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,322
The captain and I will deal with the Yoju.

165
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:32,367
No, you get some rest.

166
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,119
You too, Captain.

167
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:39,290
That's right. You only have 1% left
until your suit overheats.

168
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,668
You fired a whole bunch
of high-powered shots.

169
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,462
Leave the Yoju to us.

170
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,964
No, I'm fine.

171
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:00,937
What is that?

172
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,777
The Yoju...

173
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:11,114
So that last scream
wasn't its death rattle?

174
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,783
Energy levels rising...

175
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,369
It's an ultra-massive Yoju bomb!

176
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:20,457
The blast's estimated impact
is equal to 20 kilotons of TNT!

177
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,417
That's the same as a nuclear bomb!

178
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,170
No! Don't shoot!

179
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,176
Evacuate!

180
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,220
No... there's no time...

181
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:35,597
If that thing hits the ground...

182
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,015
Human...

183
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:44,898
Looks like this fight is a draw.

184
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,153
No, Senpai!

185
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,782
Kafka?!

186
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:56,534
Get back here! There's nothing you can do!

187
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:00,080
Wait...

188
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,539
How's he so fast?

189
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,459
That's not what 1% unleashed
combat power looks like!

190
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,640
We're detecting a gigantic
Kaiju signal above the base!

191
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,686
Fortitude 9.8!

192
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,190
This signal, it's...

193
00:18:29,484 --> 00:18:31,653
Kaiju No. 8!

194
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,243
I knew something was wrong...

195
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,078
But...

196
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,414
I found myself liking him so much...

197
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,086
that I just turned a blind eye
to the possibility.

198
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:54,050
You can have 1% of my expectations.

199
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,679
I'm sorry, Vice-Captain Hoshina.

200
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:59,389
Fine.

201
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:02,809
You did save my life,
so I'll keep quiet about it for now.

202
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,978
I'm sorry, Kikoru.

203
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,605
You kept your promise
and never told anyone...

204
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,316
And everyone else...
I'm sorry for lying to you.

205
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,944
Just don't take any risks, please.

206
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:17,949
Sorry, Ichikawa.
I think I'm gonna have to.

207
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,912
You're a long way from being
able to fight by my side.

208
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,250
Mina... I...

209
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:28,793
Senpai!

210
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,088
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

211
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:43,141
Everyone else risked their
lives during this fight!

212
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:48,730
I can't be the only one
who puts his own safety first!

213
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:53,735
I'm part of the Defense Force, too!

214
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,237
I'm an officer of the Third Division, too!

215
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,992
So now it's my turn!

216
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,560
Everyone, on the ground! Shields at max!

217
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,781
Well, now I've done it...

218
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,701
My arms and legs
are barely holding together...

219
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,290
I'm too old
to be pulling stunts like that.

220
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:35,420
Kafka Hibino...

221
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:38,589
No...

222
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,429
Kaiju No. 8.

223
00:21:53,271 --> 00:21:54,897
I'm taking you into custody.
