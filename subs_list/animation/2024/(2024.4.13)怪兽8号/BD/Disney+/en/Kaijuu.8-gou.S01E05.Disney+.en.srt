1
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:02,837
Last time on Kaiju No. 8...

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:05,506
What's going on?
What's happening out there?

3
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:09,427
We're picking up live signals
from the Kaiju they already killed!

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,138
You did a great job, Kikoru!

5
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:14,015
Sorry. I'm running out of time here.

6
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:15,474
So I'm cleaning you up...

7
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,352
with one punch!

8
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,523
An unexpected incident occurred,

9
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,359
but Senpai's last exam came to an end.

10
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,112
And I have you to thank
for encouraging me.

11
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,406
Thanks, Ichikawa.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,953
After all he went through, Senpai looked
even more like a man you could count on.

13
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,168
I can't take this!

14
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,544
Never mind.

15
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,381
I'm scared! I'm scared!
I'm scared! I'm scared! I'm scared!

16
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:49,091
And it's all your fault!

17
00:00:49,175 --> 00:00:53,262
I'm only suffering like this
because you encouraged me!

18
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:55,473
You were thanking
me for it at the hospital!

19
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,267
You were so cool then! What happened?

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,311
Kafka! Ichikawa!

21
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:04,440
You've both got mail.

22
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:43,330
Okay, we open it on three.

23
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:48,586
No matter how it turns out,
this is my last shot.

24
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:52,882
Will the path I'm on
take me all the way to her?

25
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:54,091
Time to find out!

26
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,511
One, two...

27
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,847
KAFKA HIBINO
EXAMINATION RESULTS

28
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:09,690
EPISODE 5: JOINING UP!

29
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:11,734
Hey.

30
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,361
Well, I figured you'd pass.

31
00:03:14,445 --> 00:03:15,988
Same to you.

32
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,949
I'm not seeing any big surprises here.

33
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,911
I don't see Shinomiya's groupie, though.

34
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,579
You wanted him to pass?

35
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,830
No, I...

36
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,165
Hey, it's Shinomiya!

37
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,545
Shinomiya-san!

38
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:33,923
I heard you were the top scorer!

39
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,925
Yeah, they asked me handle the oath.

40
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,134
I can't wait to work with you!

41
00:03:37,218 --> 00:03:38,302
Thanks.

42
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:42,056
Before the test,
I was sure I'd be number one.

43
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,934
But after what we saw...

44
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,686
I suppose we'll be competing
for the number two slot.

45
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,397
I scored the highest on the fitness exam.

46
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,442
You can aim for number two.

47
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,319
I'll aim for number one.

48
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:00,532
Oh, sorry!

49
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:04,578
Hey, you were with the old dude!

50
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,038
Reno Ichikawa.

51
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,583
Sorry, I'm bad with names.

52
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,001
I'm Iharu Furuhashi.

53
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:14,004
A pleasure to meet you, Furuhashi-san.

54
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,424
Just call me Iharu, Reno.

55
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,343
Okay.

56
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,347
Where's the old dude? Didn't work out?

57
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,307
Senpai is...

58
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:29,061
Captain Mina Ashiro is entering the room.

59
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,115
Captain Ashiro...

60
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:43,659
It's finally time!

61
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:55,504
The induction ceremony will now begin.

62
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:59,591
Kikoru Shinomiya will speak
on behalf of the incoming class!

63
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:00,592
Yes, ma'am!

64
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,065
The twenty-seven of you are,
as of this moment,

65
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,443
officers in the Defense Force!

66
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:28,620
On behalf of all 27 of us, I swear that
we will lay down our lives for the cause!

67
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:32,624
You helped a lot during
the incident after the exam.

68
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,502
Thanks to you, there were no casualties.

69
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,463
Again, you have my thanks.

70
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,969
It wasn't me who defeated it.

71
00:05:44,053 --> 00:05:48,515
Kafka Hibino, you should be
the one hearing these words...

72
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,642
So why aren't you here?

73
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,064
You had the audacity
to not only save my life,

74
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,566
but to worry about me like
I was a little girl...

75
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,194
I'm glad you're safe!

76
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:01,904
This is humiliating!

77
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,823
I still want some answers
from you about that Kaiju form, too!

78
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:08,035
I'm not gonna let you just up
and disappear on me!

79
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:10,329
Excuse me!

80
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,956
Sorry to interrupt the ceremony!

81
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,627
The old dude!

82
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,007
Number 2032. Kafka Hibino.

83
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,384
Failed.

84
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:25,427
He scored the lowest on the fitness exam

85
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:28,764
and a zero on his aptitude test,
so there's not much to talk about.

86
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,016
Yeah, sounds about right to me.

87
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,940
-I don't——
-All righty, I'll take him, then.

88
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,652
Sure, his numbers are below average.

89
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,779
He doesn't have what it takes
to be an officer.

90
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:46,657
But in actual combat during the last exam,

91
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,659
he was able to locate
the enemy's weak points,

92
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,661
and he also aided the overall effort

93
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,580
by prioritizing helping others
over his own kill count.

94
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,541
Not many people are capable of that.

95
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:56,959
And more than anything...

96
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:00,295
The dude was funny as hell.

97
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:01,713
Is that really all you care about?

98
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,967
I'm not sure if we'll ever
promote him to a full officer,

99
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,512
but I'll bring him into my platoon as
a cadet and give him some more training.

100
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,017
He's being enrolled as a cadet,

101
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,520
so I had him sit out
the induction ceremony.

102
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,106
Glad to hear it, Kafka Hibino.

103
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,442
So I was right. He did pass.

104
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,152
As a cadet, though.

105
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:24,736
That's a surprise.

106
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:34,121
All right, now that we're all here,
let's have a word from Captain Ashiro.

107
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:41,420
Everyone, I'm glad that you all decided
to volunteer for the Defense Force,

108
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:44,173
enduring and passing that difficult exam.

109
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:45,424
I thank you.

110
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,134
These last few years,

111
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,011
we've seen far more Kaiju

112
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:53,891
with far higher fortitudes
than was typical before.

113
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:57,895
We've also now seen this strange incident
where dead Kaiju came back to life.

114
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:02,024
These neutralization missions
will be extremely dangerous.

115
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:05,736
Some of you may die
on your very first one.

116
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,405
There's absolutely no guarantee
that you'll survive.

117
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:12,075
But even so... No, that's exactly why...

118
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,412
I want you to entrust your lives to me.

119
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:23,754
I swear to be standing at the very front,
acting as both your shield and spear!

120
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,299
I'll...

121
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:30,385
I'll be standing next to you soon, Mina!

122
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:32,804
HUH?

123
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,306
AWKWARD

124
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:35,432
What the hell?!

125
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,642
He's gone crazy!

126
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,810
He's calling Captain Ashiro
by her first name!

127
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,730
OOPS

128
00:08:42,314 --> 00:08:43,315
Kaf...

129
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,652
Kafka Hibino.

130
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,946
You spoke out of turn
and disrespected a superior officer.

131
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,114
You owe me one hundred push-ups.

132
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,868
I didn't mean to say that out loud!

133
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,413
He's already at it!

134
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,668
Captain Ashiro, I think you're going
a little easy on the guy...

135
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,338
Huh?

136
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,423
Did I just see her smile?

137
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:12,344
He just got here
and he's already bringing the comedy?

138
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,472
I know, right? I told you.

139
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:17,474
This place can get
pretty gloomy sometimes.

140
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,768
We need a guy like him.

141
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,813
Well, that's only half the story.

142
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,732
When those Kaiju started
coming back from the dead,

143
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:29,486
we suddenly saw
a 9.8 fortitude Kaiju signal.

144
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,530
I still think it was just a busted sensor,

145
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:35,367
but at the same time,
somebody's vitals stopped coming in.

146
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,952
Kafka Hibino...

147
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,454
There's something strange about him,

148
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,873
and not just the fact
that his suit aptitude was zero.

149
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:46,378
I'm going to keep him close
and find out what that "something" is.

150
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,463
Ninety-nine...

151
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,007
One hundred!

152
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,511
You really hung in there, old dude!

153
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:57,306
Kafka Hibino.

154
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:00,225
Come with me. We need to talk.

155
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:02,769
What, we can't do it here?

156
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,521
But if we did it here...

157
00:10:04,605 --> 00:10:06,023
Are you confessing your love?

158
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,149
It is not!

159
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:08,817
Senpai!

160
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,945
So it's one of those "meet me
after school behind the gym" things?

161
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,655
Just come with me!

162
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:22,581
You ate a Kaiju and turned into one?

163
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,041
I can't believe it!

164
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,334
God, you're such a glutton.

165
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,877
I didn't mean to eat it!

166
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,587
You're both way too loud!

167
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:33,050
I think we could just tell
the Defense Force, you know.

168
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,010
They might be able to cure me!

169
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,095
Not a chance.

170
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:39,514
Even if they don't kill you outright,

171
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:42,059
you'll spend every day being tested
and doing experiments.

172
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:44,895
You'll never be a defense officer.

173
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,396
Really?!

174
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:50,609
And when a Kaiju's powerful
enough to get a number,

175
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,529
I've heard they use its body as parts
for a special weapon after they defeat it.

176
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,240
It's possible that'll happen to you.

177
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:01,453
Kikoru, please! Please
keep this our little secret!

178
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,121
Save an old man's life!

179
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,581
You're too close! Way too close!

180
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:05,707
Please, please, please!

181
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,752
Fine.

182
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,381
You did save my life,
so I'll keep quiet about it for now.

183
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:13,757
In exchange,

184
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:18,428
if I find out that you're
a Kaiju that's going to harm mankind,

185
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,056
I'll kill you.

186
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:26,770
Yeah.

187
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,898
If that happens, I'm counting on you!

188
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,789
Arms tight against
your sides, wrists slack.

189
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,916
Let your instincts take over
when you aim the reticle,

190
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,793
and don't pull the trigger...

191
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:50,711
Squeeze it!

192
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,673
Squeeze!

193
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,926
Squeeze!

194
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,723
Reno Ichikawa,
fire training exercise complete.

195
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,766
Time, 2:35.

196
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,686
Estimated unleashed combat power, 18%.

197
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,442
Haruichi-kun, I've got a question!

198
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:18,488
I'm impressed. He's grown
a lot in a very short time.

199
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:22,367
Reno set another personal best!

200
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,287
Come on!

201
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,792
I won't let him beat me!

202
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,548
Iharu Furuhashi, 2:15.

203
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:39,050
Estimated unleashed combat power, 20%.

204
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:40,177
Hell yeah!

205
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,514
I win!

206
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,600
Don't get cocky, Reno.

207
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:47,893
I won't.

208
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,899
Kikoru Shinomiya, 1:16.

209
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:57,569
Estimated unleashed combat power, 55%.

210
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,572
Play nice, kids.

211
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,283
Both of your scores combined
are still worse than mine.

212
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,576
Sheesh.

213
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,497
The more I train, the more she makes me
realize just how average I am.

214
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,999
You've got time to worry
about people better than you?

215
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,627
My combat power's as good as yours now.

216
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,009
I've got to worry about those above me
and those below me, huh?

217
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:24,262
I'll set a new best
when it's my turn, Aoi.

218
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,936
Kafka Hibino, 6:39.

219
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,814
Estimated unleashed combat power, 1%.

220
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,732
Yes!

221
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,611
Did you see that, Kikoru?

222
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,572
I finally turned that zero into a one!

223
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:43,490
Stay away from me!

224
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:44,825
Well? Tell me how awesome I am.

225
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:48,662
Why are you acting so happy
when you're 1% and I'm 55%?

226
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:49,621
Kafka!

227
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,081
Yes, Vice-Captain Hoshina?

228
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,167
You're never gonna be
a full officer at this rate.

229
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,710
You'll be fired in three months.

230
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:56,795
WHAT?

231
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,213
Old dude...

232
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:02,759
Okay, ten laps around the perimeter
and we call it a day.

233
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:03,927
What?

234
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,263
You complained, so now it's fifteen.

235
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,222
Get going!

236
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,682
Yes, sir!

237
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:12,102
The new recruits have quite
a few rivalries between them already, huh?

238
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:13,019
Yeah.

239
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,938
Looks like, even when I'm not around,

240
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,732
they're competing with each other
and making each other better.

241
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,904
I'm so tired!

242
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,577
We had to do laps at the end, too...
The vice-captain is a monster.

243
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,496
Looks like you need to build
up some more muscle, Reno.

244
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,833
No, yours aren't that
much different than mine.

245
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,002
Our fitness eval scores
are always the same.

246
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,172
Are you serious? Look at these biceps!

247
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,216
They look like
they're just for show to me.

248
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,927
Reno's more stubborn than I thought.

249
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,390
Quit bickering over stupid stuff, kids.

250
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:55,103
Behold the muscles
of a hard-working grown-up!

251
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,981
Wow, you're getting some bulk...

252
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:00,817
BOUNCE

253
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,236
Aww, so close!

254
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,530
You can't be in the Defense Force
with a spare tire!

255
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,574
That's very rude, Iharu-kun.

256
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,953
It'll happen to you too
when you hit 28 or so!

257
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,830
I've actually lost a ton of weight!

258
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:14,956
Forget the stomach.

259
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,083
I challenge you all to arm wrestling!

260
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,376
Yer on!

261
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,294
All right.

262
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,796
Okay, let me just set a towel down here...

263
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,799
Huh. It's awful noisy tonight.

264
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,308
What's wrong?

265
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:36,394
We were just talking about
how scrawny we all were.

266
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,563
Just what you'd expect
from a former military officer.

267
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,446
What matters isn't your muscles!

268
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:50,283
You know, it's been a while
since I've done anything like this.

269
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,826
I'll outdo you in training tomorrow!

270
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,078
You won't beat me!

271
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,042
But did you expect any less?

272
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,126
That's right.

273
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,587
Excuse us!

274
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:04,464
It's fine.

275
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,966
It's about time for me to head out.

276
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:07,842
Thank you!

277
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:11,012
-We talked to her!
-She's so cool.

278
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,306
Are you feeling all better?

279
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,434
Yes. I'm fine now, thank you.

280
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,562
Wow...

281
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,273
She's got good muscles,
and just the right amount too.

282
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:26,569
But that's not enough
to explain her combat power.

283
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:27,487
What?

284
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,116
I was wondering how
you got those muscles...

285
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,036
I mean, what kind of training you did.

286
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,621
Stand next to me.

287
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:39,708
I'll show you the basics.

288
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,043
Here?

289
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,924
Th-Thank you!

290
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:59,352
So why'd you guys all decide to join up?

291
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:04,149
If you want to ask other people, you
should start by giving your own reasons.

292
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:07,944
For me, it's definitely Captain Ashiro.

293
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:15,326
She saved me when I was in middle school,
and I've always wanted to be like her!

294
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,665
What about you guys?

295
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:22,625
Part of it's my family,

296
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,210
but something similar, I think.

297
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,463
My goal is Captain Ashiro.

298
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,589
Same here.

299
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:30,925
That poster of Captain Ashiro was so cool.

300
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,595
And she was so awesome
in that documentary!

301
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:36,848
Mina's really inspired
a lot of people, huh?

302
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:39,559
She's our generation's superhero.

303
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,311
So what's your story, old dude?

304
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,607
Well, I...

305
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,609
What?!

306
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,652
Captain A-Ashiro is...

307
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,029
your childhood friend?

308
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,572
Y-Yeah.

309
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,867
And you both promised
to join the Defense Force?

310
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,952
Like a "childhood promise" kinda thing?

311
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,289
Well, I think I've had enough...

312
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,457
Wait.

313
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,714
Let's hear the rest of that story.

314
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:13,718
Oh, well, she was born
on a very sunny day...

315
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,262
She's always liked squid.

316
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:17,222
That's surprising!

317
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,724
She took care of the class pets
in elementary school...

318
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,017
Give us more.

319
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,811
And then... and then...

320
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,189
That was a great bath.

321
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,441
Hm?

322
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,277
Did a serial killer come through here?

323
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,071
Oh, Kikorun.

324
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,657
They ended up talking so much
they stayed in the bath too long.

325
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:39,828
They were talking
about Captain Ashiro, they said.

326
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,413
Stupid boys.

327
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,685
I don't have a lot of time.

328
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,520
I'll have to work twice
as hard as everybody.

329
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,774
Working hard, huh?

330
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,276
Vice-Captain Hoshina!

331
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,861
Getting your Zs is part of the job too.

332
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:43,409
I can't let myself get fired.

333
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,245
For Captain Ashiro?

334
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,704
How did you know?!

335
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,998
You were telling everyone
in the bath, right?

336
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:53,670
Assume every word you say
in this dorm will be recorded.

337
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:54,921
Scary!

338
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,551
I promised I'd fight by her side!

339
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:03,429
Oh, you know
I could interpret that as saying

340
00:21:03,513 --> 00:21:06,599
you're going to steal
my vice-captain spot.

341
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,309
I didn't mean it like that...

342
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:10,979
No.

343
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:14,482
I do mean it. I'll do my best
to make it happen.

344
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,817
Hmph.

345
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:17,860
Fine.

346
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,696
You've got two more hours.

347
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:23,741
Turn off the lights when
you leave and lock the door.

348
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,747
I'm not letting you have my spot
next to Captain Ashiro.

349
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,626
-Thank you...
-And...

350
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:38,298
You shouldn't get too close
to the rest of the officers.

351
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:43,928
In this line of work, something could
happen to any one of them at any time.

352
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,184
A Kaiju?

353
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,063
This isn't a training exercise, is it?

354
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,652
See what I just said?
