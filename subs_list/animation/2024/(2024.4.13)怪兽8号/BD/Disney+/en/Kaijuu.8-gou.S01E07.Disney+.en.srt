1
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:04,171
Time for your big debut.

2
00:00:04,255 --> 00:00:07,341
Vice-Captain Hoshina,
I've located the Yoju core.

3
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:08,342
What?

4
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:10,011
It's at the base of the neck.

5
00:00:10,094 --> 00:00:12,930
And there's one more thing.
This one's important.

6
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:15,975
The Yoju have reproductive organs too.

7
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:21,147
If we don't destroy those organs,
their corpses might spawn new Yoju.

8
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:23,607
Target sighted.

9
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:25,985
No additional targets in area.

10
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,237
Roger. You are cleared to fire.

11
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,158
Fire.

12
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,536
Watch this one closely, Kafka.

13
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:41,333
That's the power of the person
you're trying to stand beside.

14
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:45,546
Honju has taken critical damage
and has stopped moving entirely.

15
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,548
Just like I thought.

16
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,012
We killed the Honju, but the Yoju
are still alive inside its corpse...

17
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:56,057
and are going to come swarming out.

18
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,480
Hey, you didn't hear the alarm?

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,607
The cleanup crew
won't be needed until later.

20
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,859
Aw, this one's no good either.

21
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,112
The reproductive organs I loaded them with
have been destroyed.

22
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:14,575
Maybe there's somebody on the force
who knows all about Kaiju?

23
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:49,044
EPISODE 7: KAIJU NO. 9

24
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:51,755
Wow, the Honju's huge!

25
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,507
Find Kafka and Ichikawa?

26
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:55,509
You know we can't see them from up here.

27
00:02:55,593 --> 00:03:00,181
I can see why they called every
cleanup company in Tokyo and Kanagawa.

28
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:04,018
Hey, did you see the new guy?

29
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,898
You don't think he's locked himself
in the bathroom again?

30
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,275
Want me to go get him?

31
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,651
Thanks.

32
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,904
Hey, look.

33
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:16,572
This place is still dangerous.

34
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,824
Stay out of here
until we give the all clear.

35
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:25,873
Move, Iharu-kun!

36
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:33,047
Oh, I missed your heart, huh?

37
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,550
I guess I'm not as accurate in this form.

38
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,303
Iharu-kun!

39
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,180
The bleeding won't stop!

40
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:43,557
Calm down and use your suit
to stop the bleeding!

41
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,518
Who the hell are you?

42
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,978
A Kaiju?

43
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,689
The only humanoid Kaiju
I know that's not Senpai is...

44
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:59,323
the one from the exam!

45
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,493
This is the one that took down Shinomiya?

46
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,827
I think so.

47
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:08,082
Well, I don't want to
just return empty-handed.

48
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:13,212
Maybe I can at least take home
a live sample of a Defense Force officer.

49
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,175
Platoon Leader Ikaruga,
we've encountered a humanoid Kaiju.

50
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,551
Send backup immediately!

51
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,220
Platoon Leader!

52
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:23,097
No...

53
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,724
Oh, right. Your communicator thingies.

54
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:28,060
I've figured those out.

55
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:32,731
This area is completely undetectable
from the outside world.

56
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:36,110
I came up with this trick to
help me stay hidden among humans,

57
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:39,363
but it works well for
hunting humans too, you know.

58
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:43,284
Reno!

59
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:52,042
Huh? I'm not quite hitting my targets.

60
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,673
He's breaking right
through my suit's shields.

61
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,799
But...

62
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:03,721
Oh, I get it. You see it, don't you?

63
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,223
Oh, right.

64
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:09,435
Let me tell you this
just in case you ever run into him.

65
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:13,063
At first it looks like he's using
some kind of magic or something,

66
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,940
but watch his fingers closely.

67
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:17,359
You'll see him prepare for the attack.

68
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,489
I can dodge them!

69
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,034
He dodged it!

70
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,911
So I was right.

71
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:36,128
Get out of here and call for backup.

72
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,632
Why do I have to let you protect me?

73
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,099
Ow!

74
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,059
Iharu-kun!

75
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:53,062
Go, please.

76
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,913
I'm scared.

77
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,416
Even Shinomiya didn't stand
a chance against him,

78
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,377
so I sure as hell don't.

79
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:18,879
But...

80
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,173
The Defense Force officer I want to be...

81
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:22,966
Ichikawa, run!

82
00:06:23,592 --> 00:06:25,844
Once you're sure you're safe, call it in!

83
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:31,850
...is a man who would put his life
on the line for his buddies like this!

84
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,943
I can at least buy enough time
for Iharu-kun to get out of here!

85
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:45,864
Reno's a totally different guy
than he was yesterday!

86
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,366
What happened to him?

87
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,743
How can he fight that thing?

88
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,706
Damn it! Damn it all!

89
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,793
I hate this! I hate it!

90
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:01,380
You'll hit a wall
unleashing your combat power.

91
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:04,049
Usually around 20% to 30%.

92
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:07,553
Only a very few people
can scale that wall,

93
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:10,764
but everyone has the
potential within them to do it.

94
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,977
I've been stuck at 20%
for almost two weeks.

95
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,567
Ever since that day, I've thought
of nothing but getting stronger.

96
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,694
But he...

97
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,821
But he...

98
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,118
He surpassed me like it was nothing!

99
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,206
And I hate it!

100
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:47,885
You seem to know a few things about me.

101
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,512
But you don't know about this one, do you?

102
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,901
Huh?

103
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:08,906
Iharu-kun? Why?

104
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:13,702
No... What I hate isn't Reno.

105
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,498
It's me... the guy who
hasn't changed a bit since that day.

106
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,210
The guy who always needs
somebody else to save him!

107
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:30,719
Listen, Reno. You ain't saving me.

108
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:35,974
I'm saving you, dumbass.

109
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:37,976
Iharu-kun.

110
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,481
Not sure what I'm seeing here.

111
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,150
Didn't you go to get help?

112
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:46,485
Shut up!

113
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:50,280
If I hadn't come back,
you'd be dead right now!

114
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:55,244
Oh, you were trying
to get him out of here?

115
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:56,954
That won't work.

116
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,455
Nothing, living or otherwise,

117
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,000
can leave this space
without my permission.

118
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,710
You heard the guy.

119
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,879
Gotta fight, then.

120
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:11,635
Let's take him down together, Reno!

121
00:09:14,555 --> 00:09:16,974
I ain't doing so good, though.

122
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,101
I'll back you up, get you an opening.

123
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,854
So hit him as hard as you can!

124
00:09:22,938 --> 00:09:23,772
Right!

125
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,900
Let's go, Reno!

126
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,574
A conductor round?

127
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:37,703
You aren't the only one who's
trying all the different bullets!

128
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,705
This stuff makes it hard to move.

129
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,582
Guess I'll stop him first.

130
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,292
Focus.

131
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:46,336
You've already taken a hit from him once.
You know how the timing works!

132
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:52,884
Him too, huh?

133
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:56,972
Now, Reno!

134
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,934
Unleash maximum combat power!

135
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:08,775
Please, God... just this once...
just this one moment...

136
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,236
Give me more power

137
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,325
than Shinomiya or Captain Ashiro!

138
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,383
What the hell?

139
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,762
A wall of corpses?

140
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:39,473
Oh...

141
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,894
From the look of it...

142
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:48,774
I guess you're screwed, huh?

143
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,152
Reno!

144
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,289
Vice-Captain Hoshina,
this is Platoon Leader Ikaruga.

145
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,207
What's up?

146
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,503
We've lost contact
with Ichikawa and Furuhashi.

147
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,630
What?

148
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,925
We've lost communication
and vitals signals.

149
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:17,427
Ichikawa?

150
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:22,307
Did I just see that thing move?

151
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:25,936
Kafka Hibino!

152
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,438
Kikoru! Does this mean...?

153
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:29,731
Yeah.

154
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,941
He's here.

155
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:34,403
Ichikawa... Iharu!

156
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:39,116
Reno!

157
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:44,621
My whole body is burning...

158
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,250
I need to have the suit stop
the bleeding and stand up.

159
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,293
I'm still alive!

160
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,629
The battle's not over!

161
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,386
You can still move, huh?

162
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,223
It's surprisingly hard to halt
a human's motor functions

163
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,600
without killing them.

164
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,644
No you don't!

165
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:15,152
I've seen that trick already.

166
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,493
Now, time to wrap this up.

167
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,333
Would this be too weak?

168
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:35,797
Damn it...

169
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:37,048
You can still move, huh?

170
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:38,842
-Damn it!
-Well, how about this?

171
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:47,768
My comrade's getting hurt
right in front of me

172
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,061
and I can't do a thing to stop it?

173
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,648
I hate it...

174
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,610
I hate to admit it...

175
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:59,362
But Reno is incredible!

176
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,326
He'll become a captain someday!

177
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:08,789
I won't let it end for him here!

178
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:19,132
I'm about done with him,
so I don't need you anymore.

179
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,266
Please, God...

180
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:33,939
Or a demon or the devil
himself... I don't care.

181
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,483
Save Reno...

182
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:44,115
Save my friend!

183
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,953
Go ahead and die now.

184
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:53,041
The only one dying here is you, asshole.

185
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,092
What just happened?

186
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,346
I can see my own torso...?

187
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,892
Oh, my head got knocked off!

188
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,856
Sorry I'm late.

189
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,903
I'm so weak...

190
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:28,076
I wanted so bad...
to stop this from happening.

191
00:14:28,994 --> 00:14:31,079
But in the end...

192
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:36,126
I made him transform one more time.

193
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:41,423
A-Another humanoid-type?

194
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:48,346
Oh, so that's you, huh?

195
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,348
You're...

196
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,852
Kaiju No. 8.

197
00:14:58,481 --> 00:15:02,319
Sorry, Ichikawa. Looks like
it's gonna take a little longer.

198
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,362
No...

199
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,364
It'll be fine.

200
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:10,410
Just calm down. Have the suit
close the wounds one by one.

201
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,997
I guess you don't need a lecture
from me on that, huh?

202
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,583
I can't even do it.

203
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,009
Senpai...

204
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,053
Be careful.

205
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:29,888
Yeah.

206
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,473
Just let me handle this.

207
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:35,226
I know he's strong,

208
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:39,189
but I've got a bad feeling...

209
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,983
Not that I'm mad or anything,

210
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:45,236
but why are you getting in my way
when you're a Kaiju, too?

211
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,241
And also, you're a lot stronger
than I thought you were.

212
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:54,329
I'd like to have your corpse
so I can use it.

213
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,751
He managed to hurt Senpai
in his Kaiju form?

214
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:05,298
I see. You're tough.
If I'm gonna kill you...

215
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,302
I'm probably gonna need about this much.

216
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,225
He wasn't taking the fight
with us seriously at all?!

217
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:16,977
Senpai, run!

218
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,603
Oh...

219
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,024
So this is the stuff
you've been shooting them with

220
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:26,444
over and over again?

221
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,167
Huh?

222
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,215
What?

223
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,678
The wall of corpses?

224
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,305
I'll heal while I have the chance...

225
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:57,517
What?

226
00:16:58,101 --> 00:17:00,520
What is this guy?

227
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,438
Protect.

228
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,523
Can't take... direct hit...

229
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:06,026
He's pushing me back?

230
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,402
Abnormal.

231
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,029
Something's wrong.

232
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:12,365
The damage I've taken
is taking too long to repair.

233
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,783
Confusion.

234
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,036
Temporary retreat.

235
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,873
No opportunity to retreat.

236
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:23,543
Your core's in your torso, right?

237
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:27,964
Brace yourself, 'cause
I'm about to punch a hole in it!

238
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,967
Oh, this is bad.

239
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:52,655
Oh no. My core is completely exposed.

240
00:18:00,163 --> 00:18:01,664
It's over.

241
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:10,715
Th-This is Ikaruga Platoon!
We've discovered a humanoid Kaiju!

242
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:19,015
It's not strong enough!

243
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,366
How far did he go?

244
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,331
You're going to find Reno and Iharu?

245
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:46,459
Their communications are offline,
and we can't even detect their vitals!

246
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:47,836
How?

247
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,588
If they're with that other humanoid...

248
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,386
I should be able to sense him.

249
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,056
Kikoru.

250
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:02,600
Take care of things while I'm gone!

251
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,396
Wait!

252
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,024
He transformed right here?

253
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,610
This is Ikaruga Platoon!

254
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:17,031
We've discovered a humanoid Kaiju
in the southeast of Sector Foxtrot,

255
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,702
It matches the description of Kaiju No. 8!

256
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,744
Roger.

257
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,663
Sending a neutralization unit now.

258
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:25,665
That idiot...

259
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:34,174
The mimetic space was destroyed, huh?

260
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:38,595
But that gave me the opportunity I needed.

261
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,846
Crap!

262
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,849
I now understand how you work.

263
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,101
Next time, I can kill you.

264
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,478
I won't let you go!

265
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:58,781
You behave like a human,
even though you're a Kaiju.

266
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:02,452
We'll meet again, Kaiju No. 8.

267
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,623
Damn it! I've got no choice
but to get out of here myself!

268
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,173
He got away!

269
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,716
Help the wounded!

270
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,093
Good.

271
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:23,306
I let the humanoid-type get away,
but I did what I set out to do.

272
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,822
A coal-black body
and a skull face, like a demon.

273
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:47,330
I've finally found you, Kaiju No. 8.

274
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,332
Ho...

275
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,084
Vice-Captain Hoshina!

276
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,627
This is Hoshina.

277
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,589
I've made contact with Kaiju No. 8
in Sector Foxtrot.

278
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:03,638
Looks like you've been
having some fun with my men.

279
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,393
No, Vice-Captain Hoshina...

280
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:10,645
That person is...

281
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:26,828
But when it comes to the smaller
and mid-sized enemies,

282
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:28,955
I think I'm a bit better than she is.

283
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:31,457
He wasn't bluffing!

284
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:35,461
He's got a lot of experience
fighting smaller Kaiju!

285
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,297
Well, you're a tough one.

286
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,425
I'm pretty sure I landed
at least a few hits.

287
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:44,095
I've only ever seen him
with that grin on his face.

288
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,179
But this is...

289
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,932
Time to stop messing around, then.

290
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,978
This is what Vice-Captain Hoshina
looks like when he's killing Kaiju!

291
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,440
Requesting permission to remove limiter.

292
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:57,191
Roger!

293
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,529
I'll be the one to...

294
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:05,408
Unleashed combat power, 92%!

295
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,703
...neutralize No. 8.
