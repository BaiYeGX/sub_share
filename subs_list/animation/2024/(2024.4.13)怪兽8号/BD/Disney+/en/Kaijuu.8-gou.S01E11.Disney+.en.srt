1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:02,503
Kaiju No. 8...

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:06,716
I can't believe there was
a Kaiju inside the Defense Force.

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,093
And a Daikaiju class, too.

4
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:11,429
We need to deal with this immediately.

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,472
Do we tell the media?

6
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:16,600
We ought to keep this under wraps,
as we did with Kaiju No. 9.

7
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:20,271
I hear rumors that one country
is experimenting

8
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,106
with Kaiju-to-human tissue transplants.

9
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,774
They'd try something if they knew.

10
00:00:23,858 --> 00:00:28,320
The obvious move is to dispose of it
in secret and convert it into weaponry.

11
00:00:28,404 --> 00:00:32,658
Shouldn't we consider using it
as a living weapon first?

12
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:35,119
This discussion is getting us nowhere.

13
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,830
We bring it in first, then decide.

14
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:43,544
I'm ordering the Third Division
to hand over Kaiju No. 8.

15
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:20,057
EPISODE 11: KAIJU NO. 8 CAPTURED

16
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,979
Kaiju No. 8's vitals are stable.

17
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,647
It shows no signs of transforming.

18
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,191
Is that really...?

19
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:38,033
It's been a full day, huh?

20
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:43,038
What happens to me now?

21
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,749
When a Kaiju's powerful
enough to get a number,

22
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:49,920
I've heard they use its body as parts
for a special weapon after they defeat it.

23
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,882
It's possible that'll happen to you.

24
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,848
Just when I'd taken a step closer
to being by her side...

25
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,852
I'm sure Mina's mad.

26
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,523
It's time.

27
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:13,277
We're transporting you to HQ's facilities.

28
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,486
Mina...

29
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,533
Vice-Captain! I'm sorry! I...

30
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,451
Don't say a word.

31
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,287
Stand up.

32
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,510
Figures.

33
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,306
I have been keeping one hell
of a secret from them.

34
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,832
The security detail
is ready to accompany him.

35
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,885
Oh no...
I can't even look him in the eyes.

36
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,763
He's done so much to look out for me.

37
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,015
He's probably so mad.

38
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:27,351
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:36,986
This time, it's really ove——

40
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:37,945
Senpai!

41
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,992
I have faith that you'll come back, okay?

42
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,913
Ichikawa.

43
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:55,004
Ichikawa's going to be doing 50 push-ups
for talking out of turn.

44
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:56,088
Mina?

45
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,173
There are no cameras in here.

46
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,886
When you dashed in to save us all
without a moment's hesitation,

47
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,889
I was shocked to see you as a Kaiju.

48
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,182
But I also told myself...

49
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:09,935
that's just like you.

50
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:15,983
I'm putting together testimony
and footage that will help you.

51
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:20,195
If we can prove you're human,
we might be able to save you.

52
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:24,742
We're also going to report on
everything you've done as an officer.

53
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,038
Nobody in the Third Division

54
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,332
thinks of you as an enemy.

55
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,251
It's time.

56
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:35,961
Sit down.

57
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,006
Kafka Hibino.

58
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:42,343
In accordance with Article 13
of the Defense Force Code,

59
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,512
you are to be transferred
to the Ariake Maritime Base.

60
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:48,307
-To ensure the safety of the citizenry——
-Mina.

61
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:51,852
Can I still...

62
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:56,523
try to stand by your side?

63
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:09,370
Yeah.

64
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:11,872
I'll always be waiting.

65
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,563
Idiot.

66
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,817
Third Defense Force, salute!

67
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:51,703
Vice-Captain Hoshina,
what do you think you're doing?

68
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:54,915
I'm saluting my superior officer,
Captain Ashiro.

69
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,251
Of course you are.

70
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,462
We can't have anyone saluting to a Kaiju.

71
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:02,798
Of course.

72
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,845
DEFENSE FORCE ARIAKE MARITIME BASE

73
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:17,020
Bulkheads 23 to 31 are completely sealed.

74
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:19,356
Kaiju No. 8 is now contained.

75
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,654
SEVERAL DAYS LATER

76
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:46,592
I still can't believe it, you know.

77
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:50,012
Who woulda thought that
the old man was Kaiju No. 8?

78
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:53,098
I mean, the guy's got
one heck of a spare tire.

79
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:54,641
Right, Reno?

80
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:07,362
Hibino-san saved me from the Kaiju.

81
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,073
He found the Kaiju's weak points.

82
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,868
And he was always so much fun
to be around in training.

83
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:16,455
I mean, he saved my life too.

84
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:18,457
We don't get to decide.

85
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,459
The Neutralization Bureau does.

86
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,461
That's a former SDF officer.

87
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,505
Always following orders.

88
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,715
You're right, though.

89
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:30,886
The fact that a human turned
into a Kaiju is a big deal.

90
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:35,724
If it gets out, we're looking
at a worldwide panic.

91
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:40,103
The whole world's gonna have to
live every day wondering

92
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,232
if the person standing next
to them is actually a Kaiju.

93
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,234
No...

94
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:50,489
This is too much
for us to get involved in.

95
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,699
Senpai...

96
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:56,078
Enter.

97
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,038
Excuse me.

98
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,000
You called?

99
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,002
Put all this together for me.

100
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,963
On the double, please.

101
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,047
Okay.

102
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:08,507
This is all...

103
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,259
Can you do it?

104
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,469
Yes, of course.

105
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,226
Vice-Captain.

106
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:23,105
We've cleared out all
the destroyed vehicles.

107
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,315
Oh, thanks.

108
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:32,197
What will happen to Hibino, you think?

109
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,873
I'm going to need him back here.

110
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,587
When he was fighting with me,
he wasn't using his full strength.

111
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,005
Who's he think he is?

112
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,382
You can say that again.

113
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,885
Next time, we're going to fight for real.

114
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,605
Enter.

115
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,361
What do you want?

116
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,324
Dadd——

117
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,413
Director General Shinomiya.

118
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,541
I've come to request that
Kafka Hibino not be eliminated.

119
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:28,378
He's saved my life.

120
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,380
Please consider a light——

121
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,132
Fool.

122
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,927
Did you come to talk about your failures?

123
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,304
But...

124
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:40,766
Look at this.

125
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,392
All right.

126
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,024
His chest X-rays.

127
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,068
Look at what's on the left side.

128
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,528
He's made it look like a heart,

129
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:54,529
but it's a core.

130
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,158
No...

131
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:00,911
He's no human.

132
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,204
He's a Kaiju.

133
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:07,668
A Kaiju, like the one
that killed your mother.

134
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,920
If you understand now, then leave.

135
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:29,940
Daddy...

136
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:35,153
I still want to believe in him.

137
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,327
Another physical exam?

138
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,579
How many of these do I have to do?

139
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:47,165
I'd like to sleep in a comfy futon soon...

140
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,091
I have faith that you'll come back, okay?

141
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,931
There's so much I need to tell everyone.

142
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,100
I can't give up.

143
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,730
I need to get back there.

144
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,400
We're being transferred
to other divisions?!

145
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,485
Temporarily, but yes.

146
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,155
After the last Kaiju attack,

147
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:22,075
Tachikawa is down 75%
of its functionality as a base.

148
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:27,664
It's no longer deemed suitable
as a place to train new recruits.

149
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:33,170
We've seen multiple Daikaiju,
first No. 9, then No. 10,

150
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,007
and the brass is concerned.

151
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,469
They feel that this may be
a chain of connected incidents.

152
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,263
So there's more coming?

153
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:47,517
Not just more, but possibly
more at the same time.

154
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,772
We must be ready,

155
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,149
and you're the key.

156
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,988
We'll be taking the most talented
rookies from all the divisions

157
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,365
and training them across
division boundaries.

158
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,326
And that's us?

159
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:05,702
She said we're talented.

160
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,412
Is this because of No. 8?

161
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,206
What do you mean?

162
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:12,417
Their real goal is to split up everyone

163
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:15,504
who was close to Kafka Hibino
and monitor them.

164
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,133
Captain Ashiro, if that's the case,
I won't obey that order——

165
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,051
Wait.

166
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,930
It's noble that you care
for your fellow officer,

167
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,642
but this plan's been under
consideration for some time.

168
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,644
Kafka Hibino has nothing to do with it.

169
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,771
I understand.

170
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:36,399
But I don't know about just
going to another division...

171
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,901
That's right.

172
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,321
I admired the Third Division,
and you, and that's why...

173
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,239
I'll do it.

174
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,701
Do you understand? We're getting split up!

175
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,870
Put some more thought into your answer!

176
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:49,788
I'll do it.

177
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:00,006
FATHER

178
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,593
Yes, that's right.

179
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:07,305
It's an internal Defense Force matter,
so I can't go into details...

180
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,600
But there's someone I want you
to save, no matter what.

181
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:13,728
Yes, I know it's unlikely.

182
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,273
Thank you.

183
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:22,821
Sorry, I didn't feel like
I could interrupt.

184
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:25,115
I was the one who walked up here.

185
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:26,116
Don't worry about it.

186
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:30,036
Aoi...

187
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,758
I was talking with my
old commander in the JGSDF.

188
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:48,763
I wanted him to introduce me to
anyone important who could help Kafka.

189
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:50,932
That surprises me.

190
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,935
I didn't think you were the type
to ask for personal favors.

191
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,857
I said before that
I don't want to lose anyone.

192
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:03,653
Kafka Hibino is a member of
the Third Division, like the rest of us.

193
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,280
Am I wrong?

194
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,199
I...

195
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:17,834
If we can prove you're human,
we might be able to save you.

196
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,837
Mina's right.

197
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,300
I'll prove I'm human
and go back to everyone.

198
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,677
First I have to get them to hear me out.

199
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,484
D-Director General Shinomiya?!

200
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:49,616
I didn't expect the director general
to go in himself.

201
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:55,372
That man always settles
important matters personally.

202
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,375
Director!

203
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,752
I'm not a Kaiju!

204
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,631
Release the bindings.

205
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,136
But that's Kaiju No. 8!

206
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,721
It's too dangerous!

207
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,556
Who do you think you're talking to?

208
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:20,814
If he's really Daikaiju class, he could
break them with a wave of his hand.

209
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,859
He's sitting there because he wants to.

210
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,824
Maybe he'll listen to me!

211
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,535
Director General Shinomiya!

212
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:34,995
I'm human...

213
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,000
Kafka Hibino!

214
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,629
What was that for?

215
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,971
Let me tell you something.

216
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:58,184
In this world, a creature that can
stop bullets with its bare skin...

217
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,104
could never be considered human,

218
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,064
Kaiju No. 8.

219
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,524
Daddy...

220
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,574
I'm not Kaiju No. 8.

221
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,327
I'm Kafka Hibino.

222
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,705
You are, huh?

223
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:23,460
That's the signal. Unlocking FS-1002.

224
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,211
Request for authorization cleared.

225
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:35,472
What's that?

226
00:17:39,476 --> 00:17:40,477
Nerve link cleared.

227
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,898
Driver and Kaiju No. 2's
cell synchronization, all clear.

228
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,400
FS-1002 activation complete.

229
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,701
Then you can die in that form.

230
00:17:57,786 --> 00:18:00,955
Commencing disposal of Kaiju No. 8!

231
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,583
I won't fully transform!

232
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,835
I'll prove I'm human!

233
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,389
Oh, crap!

234
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,644
Kafka!

235
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:24,437
He's still got it.

236
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:30,276
The man they once called the strongest
soldier the Defense Force had ever seen.

237
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:37,075
You look a lot more like a Kaiju now.

238
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,381
It'll be bad news
if I take a hit from that...

239
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,342
I'll just have to keep dodging
until his suit overheats!

240
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:30,086
Why is my body reacting like this?

241
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,881
It's the same
as when I fought the Daikaiju!

242
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:35,842
But there aren't any...

243
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,093
Don't tell me...

244
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,180
It's reacting to him like he's a Daikaiju?

245
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,017
Kaiju No. 2.

246
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,022
In 1972, it nearly destroyed Sapporo.

247
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:52,692
The second Kaiju
to ever be given a number.

248
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,944
A Daikaiju
with incredible destructive power

249
00:19:55,028 --> 00:20:00,325
and the pride to never give up
until the moment it died...

250
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:06,497
That suit and those arms
were made from No. 2.

251
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:12,545
And your father, Isao Shinomiya, is the
only one to ever be able to use them.

252
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,967
So this is what
Kikoru was talking about...

253
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,012
Identified Kaiju Weapons:

254
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,388
the Numbers!

255
00:20:25,183 --> 00:20:28,102
No... don't let that thing hit you again!

256
00:20:28,186 --> 00:20:29,395
Dodge!

257
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,649
I can't move! Why?

258
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,569
When...?!

259
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,782
Damn it.

260
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,828
Kafka Hibino!

261
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,336
Whew...

262
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,091
You've finally shown
who you really are, Kaiju.

263
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:03,137
What? Something's wrong...

264
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,526
Yeah... Something's not right...

265
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,407
What is this?

266
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,367
I can't control my body!

267
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,836
Damn it...

268
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,966
Forget proving I'm human,
I'm totally acting like a Kaiju now!

269
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:44,470
Kill. Kill.

270
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:47,307
Kaiju... Kill...

271
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,725
Kill...

272
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:04,157
No! You're human, right?

273
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,368
Kafka Hibino!
