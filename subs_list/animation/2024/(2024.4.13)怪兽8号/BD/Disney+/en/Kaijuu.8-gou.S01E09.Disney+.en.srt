1
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:14,390
Kaiju No. 8...

2
00:00:23,774 --> 00:00:26,569
He felt... strangely human.

3
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,366
And then there's No. 9, which could
speak and disguise itself as a human.

4
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:36,912
What's happening to the Kaiju?

5
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:44,420
Vice-Captain!

6
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:49,383
I'll do my best to be
able to help in the fight.

7
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:53,512
You can have 1% of my expectations.

8
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,145
I can't let him down!

9
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:05,232
Okay, I've finally taken the first step!

10
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:09,862
Time to get some sleep
so I can be ready for tomorrow.

11
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:13,115
Getting rest is part of the job, too...

12
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:04,643
EPISODE 9: RAID ON TACHIKAWA BASE

13
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,257
Operation room, what's going on?

14
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:38,010
We're seeing dozens of Kaiju
inside the base!

15
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:42,348
It appears the Kaiju have
attacked us from the air!

16
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:48,729
Estimated fortitudes 6.1, 6.3, 6.2, 6.5...

17
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,272
Each and every one of them is...

18
00:03:50,773 --> 00:03:52,233
K-Kaiju!

19
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,151
...Honju class?!

20
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,001
This is Hoshina.

21
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:15,130
Captain Ashiro is away,
so I'll be giving the orders here.

22
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:18,384
Anybody who's on night watch,
take battle stations.

23
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:20,719
Get the off-duty officers here, too.

24
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,763
All hands, prepare for combat.

25
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:23,681
Roger!

26
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,516
Lure as many as you can
into the training area!

27
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,893
Make damn sure
none of them get off the base!

28
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:31,897
But we're not hearing any reports
of damage from outside the base...

29
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,899
That can't mean...

30
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:38,570
Are they after the base itself?

31
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,824
What's going on?

32
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,576
The base...

33
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,246
is on fire!

34
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,625
Wyvern-type Kaiju?

35
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,627
Those things are bad news...

36
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,674
Wyvern-types?

37
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,428
But then... that means
something's not right.

38
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,641
Get anybody who uses a rifle
together at the base's center.

39
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,019
-We'll lure them in and shoot them down.
-Roger!

40
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,649
Vice-Captain!

41
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,484
Kafka! You're still alive, huh?

42
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,569
Yes.

43
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,529
But there's something wrong here.

44
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:21,780
Tell me.

45
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:26,035
You only see about a dozen or so
wyvern-type Kaiju each year,

46
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:29,038
but there's always something
they have in common.

47
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,998
They're always alone.

48
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,835
But these guys showed up in a group!

49
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,088
Yeah. Which can only mean one thing...

50
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:44,470
There's something out there with the power
to make them swallow their pride,

51
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:48,724
and the intelligence to act
with a goal in mind.

52
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,769
An incredibly powerful leader.

53
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,235
Target sighted.

54
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,487
I'm hangin' up, Kafka.

55
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:11,038
Are you the strongest human at this base?

56
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,332
It can speak, too?

57
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,418
The captain ain't here,

58
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,920
so yeah, I guess.

59
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,089
I see.

60
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:25,094
That settles it, then. You are my prey.

61
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,097
Honju's estimated fortitude
calculations complete!

62
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,016
It's 8.3... That's Daikaiju class!

63
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,310
Ikaruga, do you copy?

64
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,269
Yes, sir!

65
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,397
You command the fight against the Yoju.

66
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,024
Prioritize keeping them in the base
and away from civilians,

67
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:40,984
and keeping the main building online.

68
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:41,944
Roger!

69
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,112
As for the Honju, I'm...

70
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,282
You dodged it?

71
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:48,575
You pass.

72
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,883
I'm gonna have to be the one to handle it.

73
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,469
Excellent.

74
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:11,682
Now... it's time.

75
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,810
Let's begin your annihilation.

76
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:35,873
The Yoju are reacting to its cry...

77
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:39,626
So they are after this place.

78
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,216
This thing's punches
hit like a meteor strike!

79
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,178
One solid hit, and I'm a dead man.

80
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,564
And its skin is tougher than No. 8's!

81
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:02,858
Fire!

82
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:08,947
It's unharmed?

83
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,328
Retreat!

84
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,039
Gunners, swap to oscillator rounds.

85
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,124
Don't attack from the front!

86
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,834
That voice... Hibino?

87
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,878
You need to attack their backs.

88
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,840
They're the same type
that was reported in '03!

89
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,133
Senpai?

90
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,384
The old dude?

91
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:31,512
I was worried when
I couldn't get a hold of you!

92
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,931
Sorry, I was talking to the vice-captain.

93
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,433
Just hit the back, got it? The back!

94
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,061
The front is easier to hit
when they're in flight,

95
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,354
but the skin's thick!

96
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,523
The core should be near the back!

97
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,067
The skin on the back
is as thin as possible

98
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:48,070
to help keep their weight down!

99
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:49,321
Nice, Hibino!

100
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:54,910
Split up to run decoy in front
while hitting the back!

101
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:55,827
Roger!

102
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:56,995
Get back.

103
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,539
I'll take the front.

104
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:06,838
I'll be the decoy.

105
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,632
Get behind it, Haruichi.

106
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:09,883
You owe me one for this!

107
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,560
He's good.

108
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,860
Combat power, maximum release!

109
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,280
What?

110
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,119
The Kaiju are working together?

111
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,872
It's no good! We can't get behind them!

112
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:41,999
We've failed as well!

113
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,584
Another Kaiju blocked us!

114
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:44,585
That's impossible!

115
00:09:44,668 --> 00:09:45,877
What do we do?

116
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,964
If we can't get behind them, then how...

117
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,300
There's another way.

118
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,467
Shinomiya?

119
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,052
What do you mean, another way?

120
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,858
I just...

121
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:16,116
use my unstoppable power...

122
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,792
to smash right through their front armor!

123
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:33,675
TACHIKAWA BASE
UNDERGROUND WEAPONS STORAGE ROOM

124
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,136
A custom weapon? For me?

125
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,473
I thought you had to be a captain
to get one.

126
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:40,891
Normally, yeah.

127
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,435
But we've decided
it's worth making an exception.

128
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:47,397
The fortitude levels and numbers of Kaiju
we're seeing this year are abnormal.

129
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:51,652
And, since you're the third
most powerful officer on base,

130
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:53,820
we've decided to treat you
as part of our main force.

131
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,165
Shinomiya, from now on,

132
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:08,418
you're our third strongest weapon
after the captain and vice-captain.

133
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,672
It will be your job
to annihilate the Kaiju.

134
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,887
Hits pretty hard, for a prototype.

135
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,806
One thing I don't like, though,

136
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,144
is that such an ugly weapon
doesn't suit me.

137
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,980
S-She smashed through its front armor?

138
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,566
All right, you Kaiju...

139
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,237
Now that I'm on the battlefield,

140
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,322
it's over for you.

141
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,126
The weapon is primarily made from

142
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:52,295
the uniorgan of the Honju that was
neutralized in Shinagawa two years ago.

143
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:56,049
Pull the trigger to turn on the power,
and it'll release shock waves.

144
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:57,426
Usage one...

145
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:01,096
Generating a shock wave behind you
when taking an action.

146
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,809
Accelerate!

147
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:12,649
Squadron-Style Ax Technique
Number One: Falling Thunder!

148
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:21,658
Usage two...

149
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,996
Unleashing a frontal shock wave
on impact...

150
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,289
for more power!

151
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,500
Number Two: Water Skimmer!

152
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,253
Wow...

153
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,505
What do you mean, it doesn't suit you?

154
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:41,762
It's perfect for your aggressive,
overbearing personality.

155
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,264
Now, who's next?

156
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:45,974
Above me?

157
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,731
Freeze rounds?!

158
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,196
Reno...

159
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,990
Be careful, Shinomiya.
They attack from the sky, too.

160
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,121
You aren't going anywhere!

161
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:13,835
I'm impressed he can fight like that
against Kaiju this strong.

162
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,927
Number Three: Half Moon!

163
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,268
Did she get them?

164
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:31,645
Reno.

165
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,647
You can have the honor of helping me.

166
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,941
If you can keep up, that is.

167
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,026
Sounds great to me.

168
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,988
All right, search the battlefield for
openings and catch the enemy off guard!

169
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,324
You heard that, right?

170
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,450
Yeah.

171
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,661
A guerrilla squad of just two...

172
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,079
That sounds like Shinomiya.

173
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,998
We can't let the two of them
leave us behind.

174
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,042
Which means we need to...

175
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:57,087
Hit the enemy from behind
when Shinomiya's got 'em distracted!

176
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,092
Shinomiya's team will stop the Kaiju
from working together!

177
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,552
Continue the mission!

178
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,762
Split into two
and hit the enemy from behind!

179
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,726
Shinomiya seems like
she's doing her job just fine.

180
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,894
The problem is...

181
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,610
This thing.

182
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:39,004
I-It's strong...

183
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,505
But that's not all.

184
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,132
It's...

185
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:45,051
enjoying the fight.

186
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:52,225
Okonogi-chan, open Gate 3!

187
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,184
Roger!

188
00:14:57,898 --> 00:15:01,192
It's an emotion
Kaiju aren't supposed to have.

189
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,203
Why'd I even bother opening it?

190
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,497
Those doors are expensive, okay?

191
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:17,042
Where'd it go?

192
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:23,298
Even most Kaiju
can't fight me like you do.

193
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,719
I can't wait to eat you
and get even stronger.

194
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,185
Vice-Captain!

195
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,149
You really are strong.

196
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,612
Sorry, Okonogi-chan.

197
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:48,406
This is an emergency,
so I'm skipping the procedures.

198
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,037
Here in the training grounds,

199
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,666
I don't have to worry about
hurting the officers if I go all out.

200
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,464
Unleashed combat power, 92%!

201
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:08,343
All right, time to neutralize this Kaiju.

202
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:14,474
They're so powerful!

203
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,315
I won't make it in time...

204
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,068
If I just transform part of my body...

205
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,542
H-Hibino-san?

206
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,419
You okay, Minase?

207
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:43,503
Thanks!

208
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,423
I guess you learned to use your suit, huh?

209
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,638
W-Well, I am a full officer,
you know! So of course...

210
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,015
Hibino-san, behind you!

211
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,521
Kikoru!

212
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,814
Kikoru!

213
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:05,150
You okay, Senpai?

214
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,944
Reno and I will distract the Kaiju.

215
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:10,488
Get the wounded out of here while we do.

216
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,740
Roger!

217
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:13,241
Senpai...

218
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:17,078
Just don't take any risks, please.

219
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,664
You're a full officer now.

220
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,251
Believe in your fellow officers.

221
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:24,669
Right.

222
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,171
I'm off!

223
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:38,141
Wow...

224
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,227
When did they learn
to work together like that?

225
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,567
Report! Nakanoshima's unit has arrived!

226
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,070
Sorry to keep you waiting, Ikaruga!

227
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:53,948
Ebina's unit has arrived as well
and will assist in the southern quadrant!

228
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:57,077
Thought you could get away with this,
huh, you damn Kaiju?

229
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,287
The senior officers who were off duty?

230
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,580
They came to help!

231
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,709
Shinomiya's team and Agatsuma's platoon
have taken down two Yoju.

232
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:06,461
This is Takao Platoon.

233
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,421
Our gunners are ready to go.

234
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:11,424
We'll attack the Yoju in the air
with freeze rounds.

235
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,343
This is Itakura Platoon.

236
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,345
We've secured the warehouse area.

237
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,806
We're starting to push them back,

238
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:20,350
even without the captain here!

239
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,937
Okay, Minase, let's hurry
and help the wounded.

240
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:24,854
Right!

241
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:28,274
Incredible...

242
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,485
It's not just Kikoru and Ichikawa.

243
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,112
Everyone is incredible!

244
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:34,739
This is my division...

245
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,575
This is...

246
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,036
the Third Division!

247
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,040
You picked a fight with the wrong people.

248
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,670
We're gonna win this fight.

249
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,306
Again...

250
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,017
It was the same with the attack
you used to cut off my arm.

251
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,819
You're slicing right through
the tiny gaps in my exoskeleton.

252
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,572
This is no fun at all.

253
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:20,160
Now that I know exactly what
you're aiming for, it's easy for me to...

254
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:21,870
handle it...

255
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:31,129
Hoshina-Style Sword-Slay Technique
Number Two: Cross Slasher.

256
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:35,466
Number Four: Wild Slasher.

257
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:40,013
So aiming for the gaps
was just a diversion?

258
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:53,109
Yeah, this is how a fight should be!

259
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:11,085
A head-on battle against an opponent
whose strength rivals your own!

260
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:16,424
Rivals! Rivals! Rivals! Rivals!

261
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,768
Huh?

262
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,812
Your core's a lot smaller than I thought.

263
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:32,815
Number Six:

264
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,069
Eightfold Slasher.

265
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,072
Got him!

266
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:41,407
That's the vice-captain for you!

267
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,201
You see that, Kaiju?!

268
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,830
This is...

269
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,123
Not yet!

270
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:57,590
Hibino-san? What's wrong?

271
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,217
Sorry, I'm fine.

272
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:03,972
What's going on? My detection ability's
going off when I haven't transformed!

273
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,974
Vice-Captain...

274
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:21,698
It got bigger?!

275
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,867
The position of its core shifted,
so I wasn't able to fully destroy it?

276
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,879
Ultra-high temperature steam...

277
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,882
Glad I brought it
inside the training grounds.

278
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,802
Its fortitude is rising
alongside the heat...

279
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,887
No way!

280
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,148
Fortitude...

281
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,151
9.0!
