1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,860
Aes.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,900
Show me what you got.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,360
Double-Headed Aerkos.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,300
Aes, why?

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,540
Answer me.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,400
You are always like that.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,780
Why don't you understand me?

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,120
Why can't you listen to me?

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,500
Unfortunately, I'm not cut out
to be a revolutionary.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,260
You weakling!

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,740
Once you guys lose your cool,
this place is going to be ruined.

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,080
I've been waiting for you for so long.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,920
I'll meet you there.

14
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,540
Prepare that.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,620
Anti-phaser, ready.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,710
(Metallic Rouge)

17
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,760
Deputy Director, we have no time.

18
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,560
Rouge.

19
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,440
Brother, don't come over.

20
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,060
Long time no see.

21
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,700
You're in high office now.

22
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,000
You haven't changed at all.

23
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,440
Grauphon.

24
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,120
We

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,120
can't change.

26
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,460
Look.

27
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,880
Look at the city you built

28
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,720
that is falling in flames.

29
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,400
You still talk in genteel way.

30
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,760
Shut up.

31
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,380
Listen to the sound of destruction.

32
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,560
Rouge Redstar.

33
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,080
Use your id to exchange for his life.

34
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,200
Don't hurt my brother.

35
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,820
Sad slayer.

36
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,040
The girl as a fratricide.

37
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,760
Give me your soul.

38
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,280
Jet Black Noir.

39
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,940
Eden Varock.

40
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,660
I'd like you to call me
by this name if you can.

41
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,440
Eden.

42
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,420
I'll spare your life this time.

43
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:34,760
Eden.

44
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,720
I can't believe you stood up
to protect this fratricide.

45
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,120
Is Eva's daughter that important?

46
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,920
I can't bear to see you like this.

47
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,560
I got all pieces.

48
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,280
Give me back my brother.

49
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,900
The time has come.

50
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,840
That's the Usurper's landing ship.

51
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,140
Go.

52
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,100
He…

53
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,740
He's still alive!

54
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,660
Gene.

55
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,440
Go.

56
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,500
Rouge.

57
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,320
You are that…

58
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,900
Looks like you can fight me.

59
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,200
Come on, let's fight.

60
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,840
Step aside.

61
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,980
So you finally want to fight, right?

62
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,000
Gene.

63
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,040
Don't be distracted, sister.

64
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,900
Why are you stopping me?

65
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,200
Just like that, Metal Rouge.

66
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,060
You are the opponent
I'm supposed to knock out.

67
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,160
Are they on par with each other?

68
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,240
They are resonating with each other.

69
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,240
They might really be sisters.

70
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,960
If we used the anti-phaser now,

71
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,020
it's not just blue guy,
even Rouge would be in danger.

72
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,500
Rouge.

73
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,160
You reverse the phase of the output.

74
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,140
Reverse the phase.

75
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,420
Don't ignore me.

76
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,960
You said something weird again.

77
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,820
I told you not to be distracted.

78
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,560
Oh my, what are you doing?

79
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,700
It's all because you're talking to me.

80
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,780
Anyway, just do it.

81
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,300
Do as I say, trust me.

82
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,820
No way.

83
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,720
Trust me.

84
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,840
No way.

85
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,860
Just trust me.

86
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,940
Oh my.

87
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,900
You're so noisy.

88
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,100
What did you say?

89
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,580
Reverse the phase.

90
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,960
Concentrate.

91
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,300
Imagine yourself deforming
into a Gladiator again.

92
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,360
What? I've already deformed.

93
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,180
Do it again.

94
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,940
Come on, concentrate.

95
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,280
Oh my.

96
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,540
Concentrate.

97
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,000
-W-What are you doing?
-Concentrate.

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,560
Concentrate.

99
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,200
-Don't play tricks…
-Concentrate.

100
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,120
-Destroy…
-Concentrate.

101
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,580
Concentrate.

102
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,880
Deform.

103
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,320
What happened?

104
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,740
When the two of them deform into

105
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Gladiator mode, the generator output
frequency characteristics are the same.

106
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,120
What?

107
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,200
So I think reversing the phase
of Rouge's output frequency

108
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,640
might neutralize each other's energy.

109
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,700
I don't get it at all.

110
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,300
It's their two forces
neutralizing each other's energy.

111
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,620
The principle is
the same as that of the anti-phaser.

112
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,620
However,

113
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,420
I'm so glad my method worked.

114
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,360
Aren't you being too result-oriented?

115
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,580
It's great anyway.

116
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,920
There's something I want you to know.

117
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,300
Me too.

118
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,840
I want to ask you something.

119
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,280
Gene.

121
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,680
You two make a good team.

122
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Hmm.

123
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,560
The two of you

124
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,160
should have a good talk.

BREAKING NEWS
About last night's terror attack

126
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,220
MASS TERROR ATTACK ON ALETHEIA
on Aletheia by an armed group,

127
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,520
on Aletheia by an armed group,

128
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,320
-How is the Sleeping Princess?
-nothing is clear now.

129
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,000
According to unconfirmed reports…

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,100
She's still in a coma.

131
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,340
Those guys must be our gods by now.

132
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,140
The Visitors are not gods.

133
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,040
They are the first
extraterrestrial intellectual life

134
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,100
that humans came into
contact with 40 years ago.

135
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,820
They are aliens.

136
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,120
Even now, only a few of the big shots
get to see them,

137
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,500
yet they generously share
their super technology with us.

138
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,300
How is that any different from gods?

139
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,020
However, from the perspective of Neans,

140
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,480
the humans who created
them are more like gods.

141
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,560
In fact, those who created them

142
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,440
were Roy Junghardt and Eva Kristella.

143
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,620
However,

144
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,520
the initial Neans they crafted,

145
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,900
which are the Proto-Neans,

146
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,000
are very different from
the current mass-production models.

147
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,660
Immortal Nine.

148
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,960
They possess capabilities
surpassing those of humans.

149
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,600
I can't believe they
created something like this.

150
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,640
From my point of view,
it's really disturbing.

151
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,820
What?

152
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,080
W-What are you doing?

153
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,020
What?

154
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,160
This?

155
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,240
If I didn't wear it, people
would know I'm not a human.

156
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,720
What?

157
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,080
Naomi, aren't you a human?

158
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,500
Naomi Orthmann is not a human,

159
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,260
but a Contact Nean that the Visitors
created for making contact with humans.

160
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,820
That is me.

161
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,780
Haven't I told you?

162
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,580
Not at all.

163
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,940
That's because you never asked.

164
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,320
You have too many secrets.

165
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,200
All right, what are we doing here?

166
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,860
I've said it.

167
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,360
There's something I want you to know.

168
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,500
Stop beating around the bush.

169
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,860
Just say it.

170
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,400
They want to talk to you in person.

171
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,940
I don't have time.

172
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,960
Here they are.

173
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,560
They are the X Noah.

174
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,700
Earthlings call them Visitors.

175
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,100
Are

176
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,740
they mermaids?

177
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,340
In the past, we X Noah
also had a form similar to humans.

178
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,420
In order to adapt to the
interstellar travel environment,

179
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,960
it took us generations to evolve into

180
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,460
what we are today.

181
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,200
What?

182
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,720
They thought you asked a question.

183
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,020
I bring Rouge Redstar here,

184
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,840
and her code name is Metal Rouge.

185
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,020
Got it.

186
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,860
First.

187
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,360
First?

188
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,280
Who is that?

189
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,120
I am the first Nean that X Noah
has created in imitation of the Earthling,

190
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,300
so I'm called First.

191
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,720
And now, her name is Naomi Orthmann.

192
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,920
Your real name is First?

193
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,760
I am Naomi Orthmann.

194
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,640
What?

195
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,300
The first Nean.

196
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,360
Well.

197
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
How long ago did
the Visitors come to Earth?

198
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
What?

199
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,820
What are you trying to say?

200
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,300
I thought you are
only a little older than me.

201
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,140
Do you want to show some respect to me?

202
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,620
Resonating with each other.

203
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,200
Meaningless conformity.

204
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,760
Excessive sync.

205
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,420
It is speculated that First's
thinking patterns have changed

206
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,920
as a result of working with Rouge Redstar.

207
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,420
But she still has logical judgment,

208
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,780
posing no obstacles to the mission.

209
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,200
Bringing Rouge Redstar here
is a logical judgment.

210
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,260
Staying aboard this ship
is a logical judgment.

211
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,140
What they mean is you're
staying here until it's over.

212
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,200
What?

213
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,840
Your id has the key information
to interpret Code Eve.

214
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,840
Jill…

215
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,380
Silvia has said the same thing.

216
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,600
Really?

217
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,580
Yes.

218
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,320
So you'll be safer here.

219
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,640
Are you going to lock me up?

220
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,920
Did you betray me again?

221
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,780
Visitors will not interfere
with the actions of Earthlings,

222
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,520
or restrict your movements.

223
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,540
It's safest for you to stay here.

224
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,320
Safe.

225
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,500
Since you will not interfere,

226
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,100
Nean and Code Eve are
none of your business, right?

227
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,100
It is speculated that Usurpers
are involved behind Alter.

228
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,640
Once Code Eve is activated,

229
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,500
all Neans will be liberated,

230
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,160
and be no longer controllable.

231
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,200
Visitors believe that

232
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,660
Usurpers will take advantage
of the chaos to start the war again.

233
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,480
The Usurpers' target is the solar system.

234
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,520
They wish to eliminate Visitors
and humans to seize a planet.

235
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,980
And Silvia and others
are on that planet as well.

236
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,560
Venus?

237
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,720
Good answer.

238
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,400
It's the planet with the most Neans
in the current solar system.

239
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,880
I see.

240
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,760
This is the perfect place
to base your resistance.

241
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,520
More than this,

242
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,960
we Neans were born for that planet,

243
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,360
so there's no better place

244
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,020
to start over than on that planet.

245
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,860
Neans were born for Venus.

246
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,460
What does it mean?

247
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,640
We X Noah have lost our home planet.

248
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,740
In search of a second homeland,

249
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,680
we've travelled endlessly through time.

250
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,740
And then we arrived at this star system.

251
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,180
We have entered into
a contract with the Earthlings.

252
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,960
X Noah has provided humans with
technology beyond their capabilities.

253
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,800
And humans have offered a planet where
X Noah can survive in its original form.

254
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,500
That is Venus.

255
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,860
Together, we have transformed the planet.

256
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,560
The humans have agreed
to let us migrate to Venus.

257
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,780
Neans serve as the labor force
for this project.

258
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,580
They were created through the technology
provided by X Noah.

259
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,500
What?

260
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,920
Wait.

261
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,040
Are you teaching humans how
to create Neans in order to get Venus?

262
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,180
The humans let Neans work on Venus

263
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,220
because of the technology you provided.

264
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,260
And now the Usurpers want Neans to rebel,

265
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,980
and then take advantage of that…

266
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:27,120
The Junoid, whom the humans call Usurpers,
are extremely dangerous.

267
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,900
They share the same origin as us,

268
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,680
yet evolved for the worse,
becoming a destroyer of civilization.

269
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,460
The Junoid also wants to get Venus.

270
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,560
As long as they're under human control,

271
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,740
Neans will be a force against Junoid.

272
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,260
What?

273
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,740
Both humans and you are using Neans

274
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,560
and making them work or fight like tools.

275
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,940
Neans were created for this.

276
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,540
We agree that this is their logical value.

277
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,460
Logical…

278
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,100
But such things…

279
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,960
Such things…

280
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,240
Are you kidding me?

281
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,830
VENUS

282
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,220
How's Venus?

283
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,820
Any message from the
Planetary Development Corporation?

284
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,120
Minister.

285
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,100
A message from the Orbital Outer Office.

286
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,350
JUPITER SPHERE
The Usurpers at Jupiter has made a move.

287
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,060
Are they going to attack at the same time?

288
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,400
The enemies are on the move.

289
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,060
Enter into Defcon 1 against the Usurpers.

290
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,080
Hey, are they going to start another war?

291
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,040
I don't have any guests today.

292
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,680
You are…

293
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,240
Hi.

294
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,040
Now it's my turn to ask questions.

295
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,100
Why did you betray me?

296
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,220
Why did you hand me over to the Ochrona?

297
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,540
Well…

298
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,340
Explain it.

299
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,040
Because I thought
it's the safest thing to do.

300
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,160
If not, you would have
been disassembled by now.

301
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:14,480
Can't you discuss it with me beforehand?

302
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,860
Sorry.

303
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,020
Let me hit you once.

304
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,760
What?

305
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,480
Do you have any idea
how bad that makes me feel?

306
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,300
I was thrown into strange water,

307
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,120
-and my Nectar was almost gone.
-Okay.

308
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,060
-You said something weird like phase.
-I get it.

309
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,700
Don't hit me hard.

310
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,040
I'm not as…

311
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,680
It hurts.

312
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,860
You…

313
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,780
I'm not as strong as you.

314
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,700
How can you punch me with your fist?

315
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,480
Will you come with me?

316
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,420
After all, without me,
you'll barely survive.

317
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,080
Annoying!

318
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,020
That's it. I'm leaving.

319
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,300
Where are you going?

320
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,020
Venus, of course.

321
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,180
It's dangerous.

322
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:08,340
It is a logical judgement
to have Rouge Redstar stay here.

323
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,040
I suggest you stay here.

324
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,460
Indeed.

325
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:17,000
Even the Usurpers, Junoid can't
easily attack this orbital city.

326
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,480
As long as Rouge Redstar stays here,

327
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,220
Code Eve wouldn't be activated,
so it's very safe.

328
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,640
Correct.

329
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,720
But,

330
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,280
now Venus could fall into
the hands of Junoid.

331
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,680
Placing our bets on Rouge Redstar
and letting her solve this with her abilities

332
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,000
is also a logical judgment
from my perspective.

333
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,080
X Noah can't interfere with
any individual's will to act.

334
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,780
Therefore, I agree to your proposal.

335
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:57,300
Let's start discussing what's the best
solution if First's proposal fails.

336
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,160
Thank you all.

337
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,440
Then I'll go with her and
do everything I can to help her.

338
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,200
We do not agree First go to Venus.

339
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,840
First's mission is limited to contact
and negotiation with the Earthlings.

340
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,940
Combat is not part of your mission.

341
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,280
I'm here to ask you
to take a leave of absence.

342
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,480
Leave of absence?

343
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,100
I've never asked for a break
since I was created.

344
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,620
Science also confirms

345
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:34,040
proper leave helps
improve work efficiency.

346
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,020
Here is the relevant data.

347
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,900
We agree to its rationale.

348
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,420
Thank you.

349
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,600
I can't believe you can
deal with those things.

350
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,840
I'm used to it, after all.

351
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,240
But,

352
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,280
when I'm on a leave, I hope
they can pay me as usual.

353
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,980
So,

354
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,780
how are we supposed to get to Venus?

355
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,280
Well…

356
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,900
See, we have a way.

357
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:07,880
What?

358
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,880
Hi.
