1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,960
Will he really be on Mars?

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,180
What do you mean?

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,820
That suspect.

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,360
That red figure who was seen

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,900
at the murder scene of Dr. Roy Junghardt.

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,840
He will be there.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,080
I'm really worried.

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,660
Don't worry.

9
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,400
The Aletheia that manages Neans
wants to cover up these two murder cases.

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,460
That sounds a lot like the Aletheia.

11
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,360
At this time,

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:32,020
the electromagnetic wave anomaly identical
to that in Dr. Junghardt's case was observed.

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,620
This time the victim
appeared to be a human.

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,500
Is it possible
that Nean was the one killed?

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,140
The Aletheia will only act
when Neans are involved.

16
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,800
The first is on Earth,

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,180
and the second is on Mars.

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,760
Following the clue is the basic operation
of investigation, right?

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,280
Detective Ash.

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,940
I don't think that's a good enough reason
for us to go to Mars.

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,640
That's my hunch.

22
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,320
BREAKING NEWS: MYSTERIOUS RED FIGURE WREAKS HAVOC
However, interference signal appeared

23
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,660
around this suspect in the footage.

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,640
It seems we need to study your hunch.

25
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:16,720
(Metallic Rouge)

26
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,000
You're so slow.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,160
It's all your own stuff.

28
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,880
Don't get mad.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,860
Brother.

30
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,280
So cool.

31
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,300
I want to take a picture too.

32
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,880
Miguel, Emily.

33
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,400
It's dangerous. Don't run around.

34
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,300
I'll pay you a visit tomorrow.

35
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,640
As soon as you see our new product…

36
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,800
Wait.

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,160
I need to get on.

38
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,880
You're too cunning.

39
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,140
Give it to me.

40
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,140
You're always using it. Too cunning.

41
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,800
Emily, you don't know how to use it.

42
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,860
No way!

43
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,240
You two,

44
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,940
look over there.

45
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,680
What is that?

46
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,100
That's a Vostok level second class
space defense armored ship.

47
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,880
Vostok?

48
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,900
It's a warship.

49
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,380
During the great war, it served
on the front lines of Mars,

50
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:51,240
day and night in orbit
fighting the Usurpers.

51
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,460
Usurpers?

52
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,140
A long time ago,

53
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,560
there was a group of aliens
from the other side of the galaxy.

54
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,400
Humans called them as Visitors.

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,840
And then there were other aliens.

56
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,280
However,

57
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,000
these aliens attacked humans
with extreme ferocity,

58
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,500
so humans called them as Usurpers.

59
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,840
A cosmic war broke out
between humans and Usurpers

60
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,240
who could not understand each other.

61
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,060
And Mars has become
humans' last line of defense.

62
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,860
Please look to your right.

63
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,020
That's the remains of the weapon
that was used to fight the Usurpers.

64
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,360
The fierce battles continued incessantly.

65
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,440
Humans have developed all kinds
of weapons to fight the Usurpers.

66
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,040
Do you know
what the greatest weapon of all is?

67
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,960
Missile?

68
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,840
No.

69
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,900
Beam, the super beam.

70
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,360
The answer is

71
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:48,960
Nean.

72
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,100
Nean?

73
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,120
Neans and humans have fought together
against the Usurpers before.

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
Are you a Nean?

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,500
How is that possible?

76
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,880
Neans would have scars on their faces.

77
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,760
Uncle, you are a Nean, right?

78
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,480
Have you ever killed anyone?

79
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,580
If Huey would kill,
that'd be truly terrifying.

80
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,800
Don't you know?

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,100
Neans have the Asimov Code in them.

82
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,300
What?

83
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,840
Asimov Code.

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,420
It's programmed into my mind,
warning me not to do harm to humans.

85
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,780
Although he would not kill,

86
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,740
Huey was once a soldier
who had his moment in war.

87
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,000
When he was dealing with war machines…

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Honey.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,740
Don't talk about such terrible things.

90
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,100
We're on a rare trip out for fun!

91
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,620
My job now is to serve Master and Madam.

92
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,100
Huey.

93
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,680
Maybe it's about time
for you to inject the Nectar.

94
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,420
I'm still fine.

95
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,600
Thank you for your concern, Madam.

96
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,100
Madam,

97
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,820
let me get you a blanket.

98
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,080
Just give it to her.

99
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,780
You're so childish.

100
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,900
I'm not an adult, but a cute kid.

101
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,180
I understand how it feels.

102
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,920
You don't want to be
robbed of what you like, right?

103
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,780
That's Broma chocolate, right?

104
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,460
I love it too.

105
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:21,120
You know well about wars on Mars.

106
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,680
Not at all. I'm flattered.

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,840
Are you a military historian beauty?

108
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,120
She is just a military history nerd.

109
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,840
So, are you a student?

110
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,980
Sort of.

111
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,340
Could you stop taking pictures?

112
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,000
Sorry. It's because
you're very photogenic.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,880
What is that?

114
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,600
My partner.

115
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,440
That's an optical camera, right?

116
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,960
Camera? It's quite big.

117
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,100
Although it's super cumbersome to use,
big and easy to crash,

118
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,140
it has helped me a lot.

119
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,140
It is my best partner.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,420
I'm Jill, a journalist.

121
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,560
I'm investigating about Neans
in today's society.

122
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,600
While there are many Neans working on Mars
in reclamation and war-related industries,

123
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,640
there are also Neans
who are suffering discrimination.

124
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,540
What about you?

125
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,300
Why are you going to Wellstown?

126
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,660
Well…

127
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,400
We're going after the bad guys.

128
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,140
Bad guys?

129
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,520
We are military history nerds
who travel with shameful story setting.

130
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,960
Oh no, I'm so embarrassing.

131
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,800
My name is Naomi Orthmann.

132
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,920
Nice to meet you.

133
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,300
Come on.

134
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,720
Rouge Redstar.

135
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,360
Rouge.

136
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,520
What a beautiful name.

137
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,840
Thank you.

138
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,160
Journalist.

139
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,980
A grandma with her grandchildren.

140
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,460
Travelers and their Nean servants.

141
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,940
- A salesman.
- Rest assured.

142
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,320
Mysterious people.

143
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,280
Didn't Grandma say kids
can't go by themselves?

144
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,920
But I want to go out and see.

145
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,280
Do you want to go up to the deck?

146
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,840
I'll take you there.

147
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,740
What?

148
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,700
Great.

149
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,580
Really?

150
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,120
Really.

151
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,080
This girl will take you there.

152
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,460
What?

153
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,240
Let's go.

154
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,140
Great!

155
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,280
No, well…

156
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,340
There's a saying, "Let the kids
see the world if you love them."

157
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,540
Just climb the ladder to adulthood.

158
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,800
I want to show this to my mom.

159
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,980
Mom?

160
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,140
She's in a hospital in Wellstown.

161
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,760
My mom can't go outside,

162
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:32,320
so we'd take pictures for her.

163
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,040
Oh my, give me back my camera.

164
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,100
Hey.

165
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,660
What do you do for a living?

166
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,460
Wait, let me guess.

167
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,740
I'm holding the first
Profession Guessing competition.

168
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,000
Are you…

169
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,940
Are you an assassin
for some underground organization?

170
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,900
Are you a member
of the Mars Birdwatching Society?

171
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,600
No?

172
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,540
You look smart.

173
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,120
Are you engaging in IT or management?

174
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,680
Wait, let me guess.

175
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,660
Please give me a hint.

176
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,580
It's a job related to the body.

177
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,440
Is it massage-related one?

178
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,060
Let's go in.

179
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,900
Target located.

180
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,100
Commence combat operations.

181
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,320
Bring the target back alive.

182
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,720
Understood.

183
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,880
It seems those dangerous guys
are coming for us.

184
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,280
No, not necessary.

185
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,880
It might just be a fun field trip
of military nerds.

186
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,300
And then he used a ray gun
to char the pigeons in an instant.

187
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,760
EMERGENCY STOP
This bus has made an emergency stop.

188
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,950
EMERGENCY STOP
Dear passengers…

189
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,320
Dear passengers…

190
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,400
Please follow the instructions
of the staff.

191
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,620
The staff?

192
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,540
-Me?
-Dear passengers…

193
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,600
Give me this girl.

194
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,260
As long as we get what we want,
we'll keep you safe.

195
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,240
Let me repeat that.

196
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,720
Give me this girl.

197
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,200
As long as we get what we want,
we'll keep you safe.

198
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,740
Where did that girl go?

199
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,160
Wasn't she sitting here?

200
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,220
How could we give a girl to those guys?

201
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,260
They look like mercenaries.

202
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:33,280
Didn't they say if we give them the girl,
they'd keep us safe?

203
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:36,240
People like that
don't keep their promises.

204
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,340
They're not going to
let us get away with this.

205
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,760
What should we do?

206
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,400
Hey, do something.

207
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,040
I can do nothing.

208
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,260
It's been a long time
since I drove manually.

209
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,920
Start the bus now.

210
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,520
Well, manual drive…

211
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,420
Move!

212
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,740
I'll deal with them.

213
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,740
I wanted to move
as inconspicuously as possible.

214
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,280
I'll take care of it.

215
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,860
We have no choice.

216
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,140
3 minutes.

217
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,980
3 seconds.

218
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,380
2 minutes.

219
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,520
90 seconds.

220
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,580
Understood.

221
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,980
Leave it to you.

222
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,360
Don't move.

223
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,240
Don't even think about playing any tricks.

224
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,640
What?

225
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,600
You can drive?

226
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,940
I was a racer when I was young.

227
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,380
They called me the Lady Speed.

228
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,460
120 seconds. You're 30 seconds out.

229
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,180
So strict.

230
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,880
Please make sure you keep to the time.

231
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,980
You two,

232
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,640
what did you do?

233
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,800
Just a scratch.

234
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,080
Luckily, you just
got hit by a stray bullet.

235
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,920
Are you alright?

236
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,440
You are useless!

237
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,500
You can't even protect your master.

238
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,160
You got shot too, right?

239
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,660
The bullet went all the way through
without hitting the injection port.

240
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,800
You'll be fine.

241
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,440
So you are a doctor.

242
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,020
There's a forest over there.

243
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,980
Okay.

244
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,640
Everyone, hold on tight.

245
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,360
Or you'll be thrown out.

246
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,030
(Episode 2: Wander in the Labyrinth)

247
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,020
No way.

248
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,920
The whole cable system is broken.

249
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,200
What do we do now?

250
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,260
It would be bad if I didn't
make it to Wellstown today.

251
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,820
There should be a military base
that was used during the war.

252
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,200
Perhaps we can find a substitute.

253
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,780
I'll go find it.

254
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,400
You know a lot.

255
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,140
After all, I'm a military history nerd.

256
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,900
We need an RG200 cable.

257
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,200
Please find the same type.

258
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,300
Understood.

259
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,340
You should go with her.

260
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,240
What?

261
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,240
Me too.

262
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,860
I'll go as well.

263
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,460
You stay here.

264
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,300
What?

265
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,760
I want to go.

266
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,320
What if they show up again?

267
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,780
Rouge, you stay.

268
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,260
Woof.

269
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,980
Amazing! When did you guys take this?

270
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,920
These guys must be SOA, right?

271
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,700
What's SOA?

272
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,040
Sons of Ares,

273
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,720
abbreviated as SOA.

274
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,160
It's a civilian security company.

275
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,640
Simply put, they're mercenaries.

276
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,400
They are employed by someone.

277
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,540
YO… HEI…

278
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,480
It's a really good shot, anyway.

279
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,400
This one can win the Pulitzer Award.

280
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,760
I can take a picture like that.

281
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,900
You're not even close.

282
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,300
Wait for me.

283
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,600
Go after the bad guys.

284
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,640
I think you were not lying.

285
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,740
I was lying.

286
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,360
We were saved thanks to you.

287
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,280
Thank you.

288
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,940
I was just following orders.

289
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,140
You are free.

290
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,520
Free?

291
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,300
Me?

292
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,480
Freedom is the ability
to make your own choices.

293
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,560
Right?

294
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,260
Let's go get some amazing pictures
and show them to your brother, okay?

295
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,300
Hmm.

296
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,400
Let's go.

297
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,220
Someone's here…

298
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,900
Nean

299
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,120
fought with humans, right?

300
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,300
Thank you.

301
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,820
Wow.

302
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,920
What is this?

303
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,720
The Usurper's war machine,

304
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,320
commonly known as cylinder head.

305
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,620
As long as it's not activated,

306
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,500
it's just a piece of scrap metal.

307
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,520
What are you doing?

308
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,520
Investigating the battlefield ruins.

309
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,420
This area used to be
a fierce battleground.

310
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,360
This won't work either.

311
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,020
I can't exchange it for money.

312
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,640
Who are you?

313
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,120
Emily.

314
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,140
What happened?

315
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,280
Emily is missing.

316
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,680
What?

317
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,520
Well, Rouge is missing too.

318
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,920
Did she run away?

319
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,980
Emily.

320
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,380
Don't move.

321
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,940
This model responds to moving objects.

322
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,640
Just stay quiet like this.

323
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,360
Soon it will go back into sleep mode.

324
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,040
What?

325
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
Let's run.

326
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,760
Found it.

327
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,720
This

328
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,100
is the cylinder head.

329
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,980
What's wrong?

330
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,140
Emily.

331
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,180
Damn.

332
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,900
Why is there something like this here?

333
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Is it…

334
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,440
Emily.

335
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,240
Rouge.

336
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,520
I've fixed it.

337
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,380
Start the bus now.
That dangerous thing is coming.

338
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,880
Who are you?

339
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,660
No way.

340
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,100
I'm setting off.

341
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,360
Rouge, where did you go?

342
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,560
The attack was bounced off.

343
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,280
Get a bit closer.

344
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,040
Get inside the shield.

345
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,140
You're always forcing me
to do something like that.

346
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,820
Hold on tight.

347
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,320
Well, where's Rouge?

348
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,460
Maybe we should head back.

349
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,800
Well, she should be fine.

350
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,440
You are pretty good.

351
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,420
Who are you?

352
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,020
Did you take this picture?

353
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,320
You're quite impressive.

354
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,740
I also have an older brother.

355
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,640
So I know how you feel.

356
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,100
Thank you.

357
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,720
You've grown up.

358
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,800
The kid has seen the world and successfully
climbed the ladder to adulthood.

359
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,840
Right.
