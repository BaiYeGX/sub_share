1
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,040
Are you free?

2
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:29,270
Rouge Redstar.

3
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,400
Father.

4
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,770
(Metallic Rouge)

5
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,920
Father.

6
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,240
You should have killed by Giallon.

7
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,790
Is he a Nean?

8
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,530
Are you a fake Junghardt?

9
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,760
No, he's real.

10
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,530
He is the real father.

11
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,000
Right, Rouge.

12
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,250
No.

13
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,040
This guy is a fake.

14
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,800
That's rude, my child.

15
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,350
I have a Nean body just like you.

16
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,480
However,

17
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,450
a Nean is also a product
that imitates humans.

18
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,470
In that sense,

19
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,530
maybe I am a fake as you said.

20
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,050
But,

21
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,940
I got the real deal here.

22
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,080
Memories library.

23
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,130
I think it's a system that can store
human memories on external devices?

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,750
Did he upload his personality into a cloned
Nean before being killed by Giallon?

25
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:09,540
I got killed by Giallon?

26
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,140
Silvia never actually
asked Giallon to monitor me.

27
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,960
In other words,

28
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,920
Giallon didn't understand Silvia at all.

29
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,390
Nor did he come to monitor me.

30
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,840
So he didn't come to kill me.

31
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,400
Stop talking nonsense.

32
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,930
This is not nonsense.

33
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,030
Then, who

34
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,080
did kill me?

35
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,610
The only person who can kill me

36
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,310
is only me.

37
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,250
Impossible.

38
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,820
I have…

39
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,710
Then think about it.

40
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,240
When and where did you
ask him to monitor me?

41
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,800
That's easy.

42
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,590
I was

43
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,380
-in Rio de Janeiro.
-In the space station in Rio de Janeiro.

44
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,800
It was a rainy day, right?

45
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,560
That was the day I set.

46
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,620
You liar!

47
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,010
Once upon a time,

48
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,290
there was a puppetmaster
who pursued eternity.

49
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,890
This puppetmaster used magic

50
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:28,050
to transfer his own memories
and consciousness to a puppet.

51
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,430
Then, he erased his body
that has long since aged

52
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,300
to become a new seed,

53
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,530
and transformed into a new being
and travelled to higher places.

54
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,970
It was the desire of his aged body.

55
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,910
Cyan.

56
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,540
The puppetmaster built nine puppets

57
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,200
before he transferred.

58
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,010
Although they are puppets,

59
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,080
they all have self-awareness
and live freely.

60
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,890
No.

61
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,500
It's what they believe.

62
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,240
From their birth, they've been manipulated
by the puppetmaster with invisible threads.

63
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:19,010
And everything they see, hear, and think
is under the control of the puppetmaster.

64
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,820
And,

65
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,740
their minds are also under his control.

66
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,680
You liar!

67
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,660
In order to protect humans,

68
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:35,030
they came forward and
fought the demons called Usurpers.

69
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,310
But all they had learned
on the brutal battlefield

70
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,960
was the ugliness
and selfishness of humans,

71
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,610
so they become enlightened,

72
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,990
realizing that they are
merely puppets after all,

73
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,650
and simply tools
to be discarded after use.

74
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,810
Therefore, after the battle
with the demons ends,

75
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,280
they parted ways with humans

76
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,090
and vanished without a trace.

77
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,040
They thought they rebelled against
humans of their own will,

78
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,430
but that's not true.

79
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,360
Even in term of that,

80
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,560
they have only been manipulated
by their master, the puppetmaster.

81
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,910
He is the world's playwright and creator.

82
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,050
All the plots are melodies created by him.

83
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:28,470
Why are you doing this to us?

84
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:33,460
The Puppetmaster wants to do a test

85
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,760
to see if these puppets can be humans,

86
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,990
and if they can surpass humans.

87
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,680
Shut up!

88
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,680
Aes.

89
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,590
Noir.

90
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,880
I…

91
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,870
will never accept it.

92
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,150
I am

93
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,370
determined by my own will

94
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:06,120
-to liberate Neans.
-To liberate Neans.

95
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,560
Even that idea is part of the setting.

96
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,450
So is the Noir's love for Eva.

97
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,380
Exactly.

98
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,100
I did it on my own.

99
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,930
What?

100
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:23,380
Eva was fascinated by Noir she created,

101
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,410
that is a feeling for the opposite sex.

102
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,690
You scumbag.

103
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,400
Do you play with them like they're toys?

104
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,750
I am fulfilling Eva's wish.

105
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,700
And it results in

106
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,320
the birth of Gene.

107
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,910
Keep going.

108
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,730
You can definitely do it.

109
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,080
It doesn't matter if my thoughts

110
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,720
are true.

111
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,980
Eva's love for you

112
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,870
is absolutely true.

113
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,870
Move, Gene.

114
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,080
Setting?

115
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,120
What an unexpected turn of events.

116
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,530
Interesting.

117
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,760
Fantastic!

118
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,760
This is not some setting.

119
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,880
No.

120
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,720
This is the setting.

121
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,210
You!

122
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,250
-What?
-Cyan.

123
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,390
Such minor injuries…

124
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,120
Cyan.

125
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,560
Cyan.

126
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,050
Why?

127
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,720
It seems the second me

128
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,000
is proceeding with the plan smoothly.

129
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,830
What?

130
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,350
That guy also has consciousness

131
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,190
of Father, Dr. Junghardt.

132
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,330
Rouge.

133
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,170
Please

134
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,260
protect the future of Neans.

135
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,230
Protect our world.

136
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,120
Silvia.

137
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,750
Silvia.

138
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,320
All nine files of ids have been acquired.

139
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,960
Then…

140
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,380
I'm not giving it to you

141
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,910
absolutely.

142
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,980
(Episode 13: Code Eve)

143
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,070
Rouge.

144
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,480
Didn't you say that
they are equally powerful?

145
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,540
But now Rouge uses my id.

146
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,290
And I am not a combat-type Nean.

147
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
Eva Kristella.

148
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,420
Indeed she's the one I admire.

149
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,680
I can't believe she created
something like you.

150
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,720
And,

151
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,950
you are closer to humans than
the Nine who were created before you.

152
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,420
You started out in ignorance,

153
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,040
and little by little, as humans do,
you formed self-awareness,

154
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,680
and you've grown quickly.

155
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:35,320
Eva really did leave
something interesting for me.

156
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,120
Rouge, Code Eve,

157
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,440
and Gene.

158
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,160
Unfortunately,

159
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,730
I am just an ordinary human.

160
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,050
At that time,

161
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,230
from the data left behind by my mother,

162
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,770
you learned the whereabouts of Code Eve.

163
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,300
Thus, you set this up

164
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,070
to leave me the clues
of the Immortal Nine,

165
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,480
to have Rouge retrieve id
and see how she grows.

166
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Everything is your experiment,

167
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,170
the drama created by you.

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,640
There were some unexpected twists,

169
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,090
but it's time for everything to end.

170
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,760
Rouge.

171
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,980
When the old curtain falls,

172
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,650
a new stage will also be revealed.

173
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,910
All Neans will be liberated,

174
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,160
achieving a higher evolution.

175
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,200
Out of this chaos,
a race beyond humans will be born.

176
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,510
And in this new world,

177
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,970
I'll be the one who plays the symphony.

178
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,640
Alice.

179
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,040
Save it.

180
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,310
Is there nothing we can do?

181
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,560
Tell Rouge to use that phase thing again.

182
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,480
No way.

183
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:18,310
Now Rouge uses my id.

184
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,520
My

185
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:21,940
id.

186
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,440
Rouge, reverse the output phase.

187
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,120
You've done it once before.

188
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,080
But instead of releasing the phase,
this time you gather it towards id.

189
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,780
Then your id will…

190
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,920
Trust me.

191
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,800
Because we

192
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,180
will never part.

193
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,040
I see.

194
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,560
I trust you.

195
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:55,140
Concentrate.

196
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:58,880
What?

197
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:07,410
Concentrate.

198
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,300
Oh?

199
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:12,870
Deform.

200
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,410
What's wrong? What is this feeling?

201
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,970
In my body,

202
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,430
this is

203
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,780
Naomi's id.

204
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,150
Has

205
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,680
she arrived?

206
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,940
Impossible.

207
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,270
I…

208
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,490
What…

209
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,710
Go, Rouge.

210
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,760
Naomi.

211
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,500
Naomi.

212
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,080
I'm here.

213
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,220
I've told you

214
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,950
we will never part.

215
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,980
Terrible.

216
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,860
What?

217
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:06,870
So, have I become stronger?

218
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,880
Who knows.

219
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,110
Hmm.

220
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,290
We'll know once we try.

221
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,120
What?

222
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,080
How is it?

223
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,320
Cool.

224
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,720
Take him down, Rouge.

225
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,620
Why?

226
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,750
In my calculations, Gladiator
should not have this function.

227
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,320
That's true if it's just me.

228
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,100
I see.

229
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,180
If you can reach this level…

230
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,900
Now it's Naomi and me.

231
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,280
I became one with Cyan too.

232
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,840
Then…

233
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,140
Have I been rejected?

234
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,160
Cyan.

235
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,350
Why don't you understand my love?

236
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:18,040
Became one with me.

237
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,880
Cyan.

238
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,270
Are you still there?

239
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,320
Do you want me to take him down?

240
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,440
But if that's the case, you will…

241
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,700
Cyan.

242
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,160
Even you did that?

243
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,800
Why do all of you

244
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,320
reject me?

245
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,370
My…

246
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,520
My wish will not disappear.

247
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,410
Even if I lose this body…

248
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,350
Gene,

249
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,000
I still have you.

250
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,800
My dear Gene.

251
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,100
You are me.

252
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,400
I am you.

253
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,050
I am me.

254
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:35,750
I will not never be you.

255
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:40,920
Why do you all leave me alone?

256
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,200
Because being alone suits you better.

257
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,650
Actually

258
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,200
you are aware of this, right?

259
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,570
You will be like this as well.

260
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,130
I don't want

261
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,330
to be alone.

262
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,990
Cyan.

263
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,470
Sister.

264
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,760
Cyan.

265
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,130
Your new form

266
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,880
looks cool.

267
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,060
I won.

268
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,970
Because I have you fight with me.

269
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,120
Am I your younger sister now?

270
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,160
Your real younger sister.

271
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:28,850
You are my younger sister.

272
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,730
Cyan, you are my real younger sister.

273
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,400
Sister.

274
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,200
Let's have pancakes together.

275
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,960
I'm sorry.

276
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,300
I'm sorry.

277
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,580
It's useless to stop her, right?

278
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,810
This is what Eva wanted.

279
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,680
Do you really let me do whatever I want?

280
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,130
Haven't you already decided?

281
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,100
What is the future of this rotten world?

282
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,020
Forget it. Let's just do whatever we want.

283
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,770
This is our style.

284
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,730
Exactly.

285
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,010
We are free.

286
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,930
What?

287
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,040
Thank you for your help.

288
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,480
Rouge Redstar.

289
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,690
This system has a program
that inserts a virus

290
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,550
into all Neans when Code Eve is activated.

291
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,900
In this way, all Neans

292
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,770
will be the ones who
fight alongside us, Junoid.

293
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,710
Usurpers.

294
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,980
Looking forward to meeting you
all on the battlefield one day.

295
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,770
On the battlefield where we crush humans.

296
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,520
We are looking forward to that day.

297
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,170
What's wrong?

298
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,280
Hey.

299
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,640
I…

300
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,130
Sorry, it's me…

301
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,760
What's wrong?

302
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,580
This is…

303
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,350
All is at peace.

304
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,610
Honestly,

305
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,410
Gene had figured out
what the Usurpers are up to,

306
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,730
so he put
an anti-virus program in the system.

307
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,570
Great, my son.

308
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,760
Please stop.

309
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,170
Hey.

310
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,700
What am I really…

311
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,440
How dare you to scare me, Scar Head!

312
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,140
No one knows

313
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,570
how the next era will evolve.

314
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,270
Come on.

315
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,370
Will the world really change?

316
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,910
It will change gradually.

317
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,240
From now on, let us make the change.

318
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,370
That girl's leading the charge.

319
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,440
Oh my.

320
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,680
She's that polite.

321
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,130
Hey.

322
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Forget it. Let's just do whatever we want.

323
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,460
Yes.

324
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,300
Let's just do whatever we want.

325
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,640
Let's go.

326
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,160
No problem, partner.
