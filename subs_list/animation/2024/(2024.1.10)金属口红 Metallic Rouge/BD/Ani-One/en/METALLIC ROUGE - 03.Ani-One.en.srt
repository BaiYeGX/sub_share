1
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,460
Huey, get some rest
when you get to the hospital.

2
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,080
Thank you, madam.

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,300
A moving carnival?

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,480
You've always wanted to see it, right?
That's good.

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,040
My foot is injured like this.
What's so good about it?

6
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,580
Excuse me.

7
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,240
What's wrong?

8
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,820
I need to check both of your luggage.

9
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,600
We're not allowed to bring chocolate?

10
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,180
This way, please.

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,860
It's right here.

12
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,080
Hello.

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,840
It's you.

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,020
I see.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Thank you for your hard work.

16
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,160
Where's Viola's id?

17
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,620
I take this.

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,900
Sorry to bother you two.

19
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,180
Then enjoy the journey.

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,960
Thank you.

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,300
Is this that bird?

22
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,740
It's Bird No. 2.

23
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,180
Yes.

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,620
Yes, no problem.

25
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,180
Yes, it's already done.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,900
Yes.

27
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,920
Yes, I got it.

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,840
Not at all, thank you.

29
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,100
Yes.

30
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,940
Thank you.

31
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,120
That's it for now.

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,920
Is it from Gene?

33
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,340
You should call him
Deputy Director Junghardt instead of Gene.

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,020
Don't mix things up.

35
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,280
Well…

36
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,940
What did he say?

37
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,940
What do you mean?

38
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,960
I mean…

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,700
Didn't we do our job well?

40
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,560
So I wonder
how he thinks of these matters.

41
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,580
Your brother is so looking forward to it.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,480
Really?

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,200
Yes, he's really looking forward
to my performance.

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,740
He also said,
"Please take care of Rouge in the future."

45
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,500
What?

46
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,760
(Metallic Rouge)

47
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,920
Nius.

48
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,880
Achillus.

49
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,580
Viola.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,460
Immortal Nine.

51
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,520
Immortal Nine.

52
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,200
No.

53
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,820
Now there are only six people left.

54
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,220
Deputy Director Junghardt.

55
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,720
Viola's id that we collected
has left Mars.

56
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
But

57
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,800
the Ochrona seems
to be investigating it too.

58
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,180
Hmm.

59
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,920
If they find out, we will be in trouble.

60
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,720
I'll have the strategy ready.

61
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,740
And about that moving carnival.

62
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,320
It seems to be on the Mars
that Miss Rouge is heading to.

63
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,680
It's going to be held in Wellstown, right?

64
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
Looks like it isn't an accident.

65
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,020
About the next target,

66
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,680
the clues to Phantom Verde
seem to be in the Nean Settlement.

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,160
I think all the Immortal Nine
could transform into humans, right?

68
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,440
Maybe there are also some
who deliberately mix in the Neans.

69
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,900
That's Detective Ash from the Ochrona.

70
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,580
It's hard work coming all the way to Mars.

71
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,220
Is he from the Ochrona?

72
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,540
Hmm.

73
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,980
I've seen him on the list.

74
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,540
I heard that he's a tough

75
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,860
and insignificant detective.

76
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,080
Nean.

77
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,500
What is going on?

78
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,660
Of course.

79
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,940
After all, this city has
the largest Nean Settlement on Mars.

80
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,780
You must be happy to see them.

81
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,960
Right?

82
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,120
To enter the settlement, we must
pass through a heavily guarded gate.

83
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,480
Only registered Neans
and associates can enter.

84
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,220
What did Gene say?

85
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,400
He told us to do it ourselves.

86
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,920
Oh my. He shouldn't just
make the half schedule.

87
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,960
Boiled crab legs are super delicious!

88
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,300
What?

89
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,420
It's gone.

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,860
It's gone.

91
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,180
My chocolate is gone.

92
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,200
I remember there was more.

93
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,240
Chocolate.

94
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,600
Well, that…

95
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,640
Here, this is for you.

96
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,440
Thank you.

97
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,320
Bye.

98
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,600
Remember to brush your teeth.

99
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,940
Didn't you become an adult by sharing
chocolate with those two kids?

100
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,600
You're really impressive.

101
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,020
I have to buy it.

102
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,340
No way.

103
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,180
We'll discuss the battle plan next.

104
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,380
Jill said I am free to go wherever I want.

105
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,460
Jill?

106
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,460
Why would you mention that person
with the camera at a time like this?

107
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,600
She said, "Freedom is the ability
to make your own choices."

108
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,320
Freedom?

109
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,480
How could there be such a thing?

110
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,360
Yes.

111
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,260
No.

112
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,540
You don't deserve to be an agent
if you're free to act on your own.

113
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,920
I have always fought with my own will.

114
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,620
Naomi, aren't you just hiding
and watching from behind?

115
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,980
The one who can't do anything
without my support shouldn't say so.

116
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,020
People like you are nothing
but a tool of the Aletheia.

117
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,060
You are just like a spare part.

118
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,280
Hey.

119
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,080
She's gone.

120
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,880
Naomi is an idiot.

121
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,120
Ah!

122
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,620
Idiot.

123
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,100
Hey, I think you just touched me.

124
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,220
I didn't.

125
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,780
Look, you did.

126
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,020
That's scary.

127
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,880
I can't believe a Nean would
touch humans without permission.

128
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,300
This guy must be broken.

129
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,100
Broken.

130
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,600
We have to get rid of
things that are broken.

131
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,940
Wait.

132
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,880
I didn't do anything.

133
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,680
Shut up, Scar Head.

134
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,900
I'll take you to the scrap yard.

135
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,160
What's wrong with you?

136
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,300
What are you looking at?

137
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,600
Hey.

138
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,080
You!

139
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,300
Get down on the ground now.

140
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,420
Nean is not a tool,

141
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,320
nor a spare part.

142
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,540
What are you talking about?

143
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,260
Leon, what's wrong?

144
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,080
Dr. Afdal.

145
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,080
Dr. Afdal, do you know each other?

146
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,860
He is my assistant.

147
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,280
I see.

148
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,240
Is that girl too?

149
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,540
Well, yes.

150
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,060
Alright then.

151
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,460
Hey, let's head back.

152
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,020
But…

153
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,860
After all, we have been
under the care of doctors.

154
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Please get me that stuff.

155
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,180
Hey, let's go.

156
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,080
Leon.

157
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,620
You should stay out of trouble.

158
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,900
I'm really sorry, Doctor.

159
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,160
Let's go.

160
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,200
Yes.

161
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,440
Ah.

162
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,620
Wait, well…

163
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,220
Well…

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,300
Do you want to go in there?

165
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,120
There's someone I'm looking for.

166
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,700
I see.

167
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
Follow me.

168
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,800
Doctor?

169
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,940
Thank you.

170
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,420
It's Dr. Afdal.

171
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,260
I object.

172
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,220
She could be from Alter.

173
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,380
It's too dangerous.

174
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,200
No, she's definitely not…

175
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,100
Do not interrupt.

176
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,660
Humans are looking for
an opportunity to wipe us out.

177
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,460
We don't need to meet some unknown Neans.

178
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,660
No, let's meet her.

179
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,660
Yubal.

180
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,760
We need hope,

181
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,700
even it's just a glimmer of hope.

182
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,360
Doctor.

183
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,660
Great.

184
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,000
What happened?

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,640
Doctor, something's wrong.

186
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,600
Dahlia…

187
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,680
Hold her down.

188
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,760
Yes.

189
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,180
You come and help too.

190
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,420
Hurry up.

191
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,620
It's okay.

192
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,320
What?

193
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,340
Dahlia.

194
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,720
Doctor.

195
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,460
Thank you.

196
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,960
Dahlia has stabilized.

197
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,520
Just for now.

198
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,960
Can't she be cured?

199
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,200
Her signals are starting to lose sync.

200
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,960
But if we let her die,
her employer will be dissatisfied.

201
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,460
Why?

202
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,000
When hiring a Nean who fought in the war,

203
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
one can apply for subsidies.

204
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,760
They don't even have the freedom to die.

205
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,220
I can't believe it.

206
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,140
This place is kind of nice.

207
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,880
The Neans deployed in the Venus Project

208
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,100
were oppressed by the humans
in the harsh environment.

209
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,300
In that hellish world that humans
had never had access to or seen,

210
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,560
they worked until they died

211
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,820
to terraform Venus.

212
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,340
They're nothing but consumables.

213
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,940
So where are you going now?

214
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,000
I thought you are here to find someone.

215
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,880
What?

216
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,220
Well…

217
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,300
Where am I supposed to look for him?

218
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,340
What?

219
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:26,180
He is cunning,
and I don't know where he is.

220
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,160
You're really funny.

221
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,420
You are Miss Rouge, right?

222
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,920
I am Levy 328 from CFN.

223
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,580
CF…

224
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,820
It's the Council of Free Nean.

225
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,990
Someone wants to meet you.

226
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,990
(Episode 3: Marginal City)

227
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,640
What should I do? If this continues…

228
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,240
Looks like things
aren't going so well for you.

229
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,060
Director.

230
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,560
About the investigation materials
I asked you to help with…

231
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,240
What?

232
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,400
It's the case of the red figure.

233
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,200
He was spotted in Canal City
the other day.

234
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,440
Sorry, I am quite busy.

235
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,180
Wait.

236
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,740
I'm really sorry.

237
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,040
Please leave.

238
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,200
He is from the Ochrona. Is this okay?

239
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,900
Don't mind him.

240
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,920
Damn.

241
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,240
No smoking here.

242
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,020
Then what are they doing?

243
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,940
I'll go warn them.

244
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,640
Hold on, don't.

245
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,700
I went too far.

246
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,980
I can't believe I said she is a tool
and a spare part of the Aletheia.

247
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,540
I guess I'm not mature enough.

248
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,420
About the next target,

249
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,060
the clues to Phantom Verde
seem to be in the Nean Settlement.

250
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,060
Does she want to do it alone?

251
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,760
No way.

252
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,040
No way.

253
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,400
I suppose.

254
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,080
Huey.

255
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,820
It won't be wrong.

256
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,200
I saw that kid
turned into that red figure.

257
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,100
I see.

258
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,160
Nice to meet you, Rouge.

259
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,840
My name is Yubal.

260
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,520
Yes.

261
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,340
Why would a member of the CFN
look for a human?

262
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,820
Who knows?

263
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,220
Don't get involved with dangerous people.

264
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,700
How could it be?

265
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,660
After all, we can't use violence.

266
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,720
CFN is just trying to fight
for Nean's right to live freely.

267
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,360
That's what everyone said at first.

268
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,900
They just want to be alive and be free.

269
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,560
Gradually, they will find these
are not enough to satisfy themselves.

270
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,580
In terms of greed,
humans and Neans are the same.

271
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,300
At least,

272
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,380
humans are not sent
to the battlefield since birth.

273
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,000
All I know about the world

274
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,160
is the battlefield,
this city and the factory.

275
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,620
Duma.

276
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,880
Dr. Afdal.

277
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,880
Long time no see.

278
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,420
We have ceased the fire with the Usurpers.

279
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,420
This city exists for the Neans
returning from the battlefield.

280
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,060
At first, humans allowed us
to run this place on our own.

281
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,500
But now…

282
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,120
We are difficult in fighting for autonomy,

283
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,620
because of that wedge
that's embedded in our consciousness,

284
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,260
that Asimov Code.

285
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,520
Do not harm humans.

286
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,020
Obey human orders.

287
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,080
Must protect oneself.

288
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,700
My third parents
were an elderly human couple,

289
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,360
who were nice.

290
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,280
I am a Substitute Nean who
was created for those childless humans.

291
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,580
I've had 23 human parents.

292
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,980
Some humans would treat cruelly to these Yubals,
who look like children and won't grow up.

293
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,580
I've said it.

294
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,280
Some humans are nice.

295
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,940
We just want to be free to live.

296
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,900
Free?

297
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,220
Alter.

298
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:53,340
They are a Nean organization
that uses force against humans.

299
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,340
Such people do exist.

300
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,320
They've made contact with us too.

301
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,440
Even if they have the Asimov Code in them?

302
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,100
I don't know the details.

303
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,500
They could be the people I'm looking for.

304
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,660
You said they made contact with you?

305
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,160
Looks like they have an agent
on this settlement.

306
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,760
Do you know who that is?

307
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,140
Do you have any clues?

308
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,300
I can't confirm.

309
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,640
But he is…

310
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,980
What we're after

311
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,080
is not your power,

312
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,520
but the free will.

313
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,320
The ability to interact with humans equally,
without being bound by the Asimov Code.

314
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,160
Your existence has a special meaning.

315
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,360
The fact that there are Neans like you

316
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,220
who are willing to move forward with us

317
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,300
can bring hopes to many Neans.

318
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,940
Hopes to Neans?

319
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,540
Of course, you don't have
to give me an answer now.

320
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,860
During your stay here,
you can think it over.

321
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,060
Dr. Afdal,

322
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,020
I'll leave it to you then.

323
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:12,140
This guy is still not serious.

324
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,480
Doctor.

325
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,860
D-Dahlia…

326
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,620
She must be grateful to you.

327
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,800
The battlefield,
this city, and the factory.

328
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,560
She once said that these were
the only places she knew about the world.

329
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,820
I only know this city.

330
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,600
I've lived here since I was made.

331
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,840
I've been working as your assistant.

332
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,500
If I could learn some skills from you
and go help my fellows…

333
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,240
Didn't I tell you?

334
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,900
That's what everyone said at first.

335
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,040
But…

336
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,640
Gradually, they'd become hard to satisfy.

337
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,720
Doctor.

338
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,240
Tool.

339
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,940
Spare part.

340
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,540
Freedom.

341
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,600
Hope.

342
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,200
If it was Naomi,

343
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,020
what would she say?

344
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,920
Well…

345
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,640
Yubal is looking for you.

346
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,680
Bingo!

347
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,120
She found her own way into the settlement.

348
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,920
She's quite capable.

349
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,140
He wanted to invite you in alone.

350
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,560
Thank you.

351
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,580
What are you doing?

352
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,800
I didn't do this.

353
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,480
I know.

354
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,840
And who is he?

355
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,480
Yubal.

356
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,640
Yubal.

357
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,160
Yubal 087.

358
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,420
He's a big shot.

359
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,040
Yubal.

360
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,760
Did you…

361
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,620
Please calm down.

362
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,180
Let's keep a low profile for now.

363
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,940
But…

364
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,740
If the humans find out,

365
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,240
I'm sure they'll step in.

366
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,680
Well…

367
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,460
Doctor, what's wrong?

368
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,340
Director.

369
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,740
What's the matter now?

370
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,160
We're going to the settlement
to keep the peace.

371
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,940
What happened?

372
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,180
Whether you're from the Ochrona
or other organizations, this is our jurisdiction.

373
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,860
