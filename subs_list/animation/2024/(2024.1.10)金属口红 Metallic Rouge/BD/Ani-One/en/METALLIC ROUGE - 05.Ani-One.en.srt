1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,040
He's the doctor's assistant, right?

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,900
Well, where did my agent go?

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,960
He seems to have been abandoned.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,840
Rest in peace.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,680
His expression is truly miserable.

6
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,260
-Who are you?
-What?

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,180
We have met on the bus.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,960
You're the grave digger.

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,540
That's a bit rude.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,720
At least call me a tomb raider.

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,640
Things are pretty bad here too.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,100
Oh my.

13
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,980
Well then, I take my leave first.

14
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:41,200
Well, do you know where to find her?

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,180
Who are you referring to?

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,420
Your partner.

17
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,700
Why would you know?

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,580
I accidentally saw her.

19
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,440
Come with me. I'll take you there.

20
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,750
(Metallic Rouge)

21
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,860
Good morning, Rouge Redstar.

22
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,000
Sorry I scared you.

23
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,640
Just go back to sleep.

24
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,480
My beloved Rouge.

25
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,520
What a spectacular music.

26
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,180
Right, Rouge?

27
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,720
Spectacular…

28
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,200
What does it mean?

29
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,620
That means something
you'd feel small after you play it.

30
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,700
It's a song your mother and I loved.
She's the one who made you.

31
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,640
Mother?

32
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,920
Father and brother,
why don't you have to inject this?

33
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,080
Because there is no need.

34
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,840
We can eat this together.

35
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,920
It's delicious.

36
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,060
Deform.

37
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,740
Happy Birthday.

38
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,000
Happy Birthday, Rouge.

39
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,520
Rouge.

40
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,060
Rouge.

41
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,320
Rouge Redstar.

42
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,500
My poor beloved daughter.

43
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,480
You couldn't escape it from birth.

44
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,440
Amazing!

45
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,220
So where is she?

46
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,300
I think she's somewhere nearby.

47
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,580
Tell me you didn't bring me here
by relying on that little information.

48
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,840
Really?

49
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,120
We have to find a way to get in there.

50
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,580
Then we have to break the ceiling.

51
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,260
I would never be that savage.

52
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,580
Please let us in.

53
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,700
How did you do that?

54
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,860
Bribery.

55
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,660
Don't be fooled by its look.

56
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,100
It is actually a key.

57
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,280
War machine.

58
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,480
They are indeed
in cahoots with the Usurpers.

59
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,400
Usurpers.

60
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,140
Junoid.

61
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,520
Knowing that name means
you're no ordinary person.

62
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,380
What?

63
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,780
Forget it, we all have secrets.

64
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,940
Then I'm off.

65
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,580
Where are you going?

66
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,840
I will do what I should do.

67
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
This place is full of treasures.

68
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,020
Eden Varock.

69
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,620
What?

70
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,200
My name.

71
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,080
Bang.

72
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,780
Do you like music?

73
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,680
I don't know.

74
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,380
But I think I do.

75
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,780
What does it mean?

76
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,040
I heard a song once.

77
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,760
What kind of song was it?

78
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,080
What's wrong?

79
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,940
I know this song.

80
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,920
But I don't like it.

81
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,900
It reminds me of people I dislike.

82
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,140
Why did you kill me?

83
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,860
A Nean cannot kill another Nean.

84
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Fratricide Rouge.

85
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Nean Traitor Rouge.

86
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,080
I'll take you to the next target.

87
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,220
Nice to meet you.

88
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,020
I am Gene Junghardt,

89
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,060
your brother.

90
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,140
What is your name?

91
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,080
Rouge.

92
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,880
Rouge Redstar.

93
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,180
Rouge,

94
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,200
the Ruby Star.

95
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,860
I'll take you to the next target.

96
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,380
A SPACE VOYAGE WITH NO ESCAPE

97
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
Fratricide Rouge.

98
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,420
Nean Traitor Rouge.

99
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,920
A Nean can't kill humans.

100
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,940
Don't kill humans.

101
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,080
Can't kill humans.

102
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,340
Don't kill humans.

103
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,720
Can't kill humans.

104
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't kill humans.

105
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,040
Can't kill humans.

106
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,600
It is Code Eve.

107
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,060
-Don't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

108
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,620
-Can't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

109
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,420
-Don't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

110
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,540
-Can't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

111
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,160
-Don't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

112
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,180
-Can't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

113
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,160
-Don't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

114
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,280
-Can't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

115
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,040
-Don't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

116
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,760
-Can't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

117
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,680
-Don't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

118
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,800
-Can't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

119
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,780
-Don't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

120
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,900
-Can't kill humans.
-It is Code Eve.

(Episode 5: Carnival Dances
with Lost Memories)

122
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,880
Come on, take it.

123
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,980
Is that one related to the Usurpers?

124
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,920
The target's id has been found.

125
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,560
Then I need to find that kid.

126
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,800
It hurts.

127
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,000
They are the negative legacy
of our father.

128
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,980
Negative legacy?

129
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,120
The negative legacy must be eradicated.

130
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,000
That's the father's wish.

131
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,060
Exactly.

132
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:32,380
And they're the ones
who took our father's life.

133
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,960
The Immortal Nine who killed our father

134
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,800
is unforgivable.

135
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,700
It must be done by us.

136
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,420
The two of us have to avenge our father.

137
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,920
This is a classified mission.

138
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,360
We absolutely cannot…

139
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,020
Let anyone know.

140
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,960
You should know it.

141
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,240
I should know it.

142
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,260
You know it.

143
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,460
I know it.

144
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,200
What's wrong with Code Eve?

145
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,160
Where is Code Eve

146
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,280
on you?

147
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,340
The Immortal Nine is a group
of Neans with special powers.

148
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,340
They are the parents of numerous Neans,

149
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,880
and also their matrix.

150
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:36,040
Though they have been
silent for a long time,

151
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,260
now, they have started to act again.

152
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,800
They hate humans.

153
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,840
Your father was killed
when trying to stop them.

154
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,740
Their target is Code Eve.

155
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,740
If Code Eve is released,
the world will change.

156
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,980
Change…

157
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,180
Let the two of us complete
what our father could not.

158
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,460
Rouge.

159
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,700
But…

160
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,800
Sarah didn't seem to be a bad person.

161
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,080
Afdal.

162
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,380
He looked miserable too.

163
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,360
He was concerned about Neans in trouble.

164
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
He looked so upset.

165
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,040
So, do we have to defeat them?

166
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,120
Yes.

167
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,720
Why?

168
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,620
No reason.

169
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,280
Why?

170
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,000
Who

171
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,620
are you?

172
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,220
I'm a Puppetmaster.

173
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,120
What have you done to me?

174
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,840
My job is to collect pitiful puppets

175
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,880
and help them.

176
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,400
Are you saying I am a pitiful puppet?

177
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,540
Aren't you?

178
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,300
Rouge Redstar.

179
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,160
And you are also lovable beings.

180
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,340
So I have to cut that thread.

181
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:06,800
Cut the cursed thread
that has been manipulating you.

182
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,840
That's what I'm doing.

183
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,580
What will I be like when you're done?

184
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,520
You will be free.

185
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,720
What happens to me when I'm free?

186
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,920
You can be yourself.

187
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,720
Myself?

188
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,880
Be yourself,

189
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
not someone else.

190
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,480
Can you be yourself?

191
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,020
Rouge Redstar.

192
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,900
Are you free?

193
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,780
Rouge Redstar.

194
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,800
Go find it out yourself.

195
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,620
Go wherever you want to.

196
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,140
And then go look for it.

197
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,480
Find it.

198
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,320
Can you be yourself

199
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,200
or just a pitiful puppet?

200
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,880
Find that answer.

201
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,040
How?

202
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,760
I have done my job

203
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,280
and get what I need.

204
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,420
I am free.

205
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,600
Brother.

206
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,060
Let me introduce you.

207
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,660
This is my sister.

208
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,100
Hey.

209
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,900
Wake up. What's wrong with you?

210
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,740
This is…

211
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,900
We are inside the moving carnival.

212
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,000
What happened?

213
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,940
It's a long story.

214
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,240
Hey.

215
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,460
I get what I need.

216
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,160
I have heard this somewhere.

217
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,660
Anyway, let's get out of here.

218
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,060
You're lighter than I thought.

219
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,840
Could you return that thing?

220
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,600
I'm not as generous as the leader.

221
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,980
I'm sorry that I can't do as you told.

222
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,420
That's a pity.

223
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:10,780
I smell the same thing on you as I do.

224
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,660
Really?

225
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:15,180
I don't wear perfume of Usurpers.

226
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,740
Thank you all for coming today.

227
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,700
Our troupe is stationed on many planets
and travels through various galaxies,

228
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,420
providing fun and exciting performances
to countless guests.

229
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,960
However,

230
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,600
our event has to end today.

231
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,160
Thank you all.

232
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,700
If the threads of fate
meet somewhere in the future,

233
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,740
please come and enjoy our performance.

234
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,560
Thank you all.

235
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,040
Look forward to seeing you again.

236
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,840
Goodbye, everyone.

237
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,520
Headquarters has asked us to return.

238
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,280
I just got here. What does this mean?

239
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,680
Maybe your application
was not filled out properly.

240
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,160
What?

241
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,960
I made it all up.

242
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,240
Please don't tell the truth
to the headquarters.

243
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,200
What's wrong?

244
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,060
I don't know.

245
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,760
Probably we are heading to another planet.

246
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,820
Our leader acts on his whims.

247
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,520
Can you be yourself?

248
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,940
It hurts.

249
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:48,140
Can you be yourself?

250
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,940
Rouge Redstar.

251
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,500
Go.

252
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,820
Go wherever you want to.

253
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,520
What's wrong with you?

254
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,060
I want to save you.

255
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,640
You should worry about yourself.

256
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,460
You can do this without deforming.

257
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,000
Impressive.

258
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,580
Gladiator.

259
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,460
As many as cockroaches.

260
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,780
I guess I have to do it
in a savage way, right?

261
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,220
Hey, what do you see?

262
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Looks like the red guy
and the lady from the Aletheia.

263
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,620
How is it? I was right, wasn't I?

264
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,340
Your intuition again?

265
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,640
Are you alright?

266
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,780
The wind is strong,
and sand gets into my eyes.

267
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,300
I'm far from the ground.

268
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,320
I'm not alright.

269
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,540
Don't think about running away.

270
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,880
No.

271
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,000
I have to.

272
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,680
I'm really sorry.

273
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,820
She has taken Verde's id.

274
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,260
This is fate, the rule of the world.

275
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,460
We were destined to lose that thing.

276
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,400
Anyway, I get what I need.

277
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,840
Go, just go.

278
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,640
Rouge Redstar.

279
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,560
We'll meet again one day,

280
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,300
when you are truly free.

281
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,980
Thank you for your work.

282
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,780
Hmm.

283
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,740
What happened?

284
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,660
I don't quite remember.

285
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,760
My memory is so foggy.
I think I saw something weird.

286
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
It seems nice to do that once in a while.

287
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,820
I always save you,

288
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,220
and you saved me this time.

289
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:32,240
No.

290
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,320
You saved me.

291
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
I just happened to meet you.

292
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,400
You came to save me.

293
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,220
So I wanted to save you.

294
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,340
No.

295
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,180
But I wish I could be saved
in a safer way.

296
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,720
Who exactly are they?

297
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,580
What is certain is
that they are interested in you.

298
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,520
Did they do something unpleasant to you?

299
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,260
You're disgusting.

300
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,400
Sorry.

301
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,980
Besides,

302
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,720
that black guy…

303
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,760
I'm actually pretty savage too.

304
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,360
Miss.
