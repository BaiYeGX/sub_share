1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,860
Sorry.

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,980
This is the staff restroom.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,520
Well…

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,420
I didn't expect my wish to come true soon.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,460
Excuse me, can you lend me a hand?

6
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,770
(Metallic Rouge)

7
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,100
Verde's id has been retrieved.

8
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,740
Naomi Orthmann and Rouge Redstar
have completed their mission on Mars,

9
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,380
and will return to Earth
in about two days.

10
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,560
Thank you.

11
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,660
Deputy Director Junghardt.

12
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,180
Can I have a moment with you?

13
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:37,760
Don't you think people can
see you through from the sky?

14
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,200
Are you talking about the Visitor, X Noah?

15
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,520
They are no gods, after all.

16
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,060
This is really good.

17
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:52,040
I think you are the one
who sees me through.

18
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,020
Minister Zhao.

19
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,820
I got to this position
because I trust my men.

20
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:02,260
I trust you no matter
what you hide from me.

21
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,180
The real problem

22
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,640
is the external interference
to the Aletheia.

23
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,760
I've received a report that they seem
to have someone inside the Aletheia.

24
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,840
Is it an agent of the Ochrona?

25
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,460
This matter must not be biased,

26
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,700
and do not hide anything from me.

27
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,340
Master.

28
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,980
Is your leg all right now?

29
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,160
I'm fine, as you can see.

30
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,240
Let's get wild in the dance hall tonight.

31
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,440
Hi, the boy next room.

32
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,660
Hi, sisters next room.

33
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,660
Where are you going?

34
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,720
Swimming pool.

35
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,120
Staying on the ship for nearly two weeks
makes us sluggish.

36
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,980
Aes, are you going with us?

37
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,920
I can't swim.

38
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,800
And I'm going to the library
to return the books.

39
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,560
So this is the paper book.

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,680
We can enjoy
Earth's traditional culture on this ship.

41
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,980
I love the smell of paper books.

42
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,980
It stinks.

43
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,040
But I don't hate the smell.

44
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,560
Right?

45
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,240
We'll be on Earth in two more days.

46
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,320
Your wife's waiting for you, right?

47
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,240
Yes.

48
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,060
Are you yourself?

49
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,780
Rouge Redstar.

50
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,440
Are you free?

51
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,220
Rouge Redstar.

52
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,020
Rouge.

53
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,420
The masked man named Puppetmaster

54
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,860
broke into my dream.

55
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,680
Dream?

56
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,100
What is it?

57
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,660
In a place that feels nostalgic,

58
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,440
there's someone in front of me
who seemed familiar and strange.

59
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,820
I don't remember it exactly.

60
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,660
Who is that person?

61
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,900
What?

62
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,740
Aes.

63
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,860
Aes, you're amazing.

64
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,660
Didn't you say you can't swim?

65
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,980
If you mistake me for Aes,
it would make me want to kill you.

66
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,780
What?

67
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,900
Are you Aes's twin sister?

68
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,020
I am Alice.

69
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,660
You are Rouge and Naomi, right?

70
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,340
Aes told me that there are two
really beautiful girls living next room.

71
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,140
That Aes is quite nice.

72
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,900
But saying you are really beautiful
is quite overexaggerated.

73
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,300
At best, you two are
a not-ugly-looking duo.

74
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,600
Has he lost his mind?

75
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,400
He has a problem with aesthetics.

76
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,820
Not-ugly-looking…

77
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,400
Duo…

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,520
I went to Mars specifically,

79
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,820
and now I'm asked to fly back to Earth.

80
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,220
We had to do so.

81
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,280
We have to obey the order to return.

82
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,140
That red guy is on Mars.

83
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,120
And,

84
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,400
there's a black guy
who's not on the record.

85
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
What are those Aletheia guys

86
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,700
hiding?

87
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,180
Hi.

88
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,980
Noid.

89
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,360
-What?
-No way.

90
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,020
Hmm?

91
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,040
I heard there was a murder.

92
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,080
Murder?

93
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
Someone got killed?

94
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,700
The murderer is Reggie Avan, 38 years old,

95
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,460
179 cm, 68 kg,

96
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,540
a blond white male, currently on the run.

97
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,700
For your safety,
please stay in your rooms.

98
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,680
What should we do?

99
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,860
We had no choice.

100
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,490
REGGIE AVAN

101
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,220
Let go of me.

102
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,760
What did I do?

103
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,320
Reggie Avan.

104
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,960
I'm arresting you
for the murder of Mark Johnson.

105
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,560
What?

106
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,840
Mark is dead?

107
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,200
No way.

108
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,800
Aren't you the one who killed him?

109
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,760
Why do I have to kill him?

110
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,180
I've been in the casino up until now.

111
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,780
I am not lying.

112
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,120
I've lost almost 2 000 credits
since this morning.

113
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,560
This is a footage of the casino
at the time of the murder.

114
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,140
What exactly is going on?

115
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,200
We can only assume one person appeared
in different places at the same time.

116
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,260
MOVIE
I heard there was a murder.

117
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,320
MOVIE
That's horrible.

118
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,640
I heard we reception staff have to go back
to our rooms when we are done here.

119
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,480
It's really horrible.

120
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,620
What?

121
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,880
That woman is the witness.

122
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,280
You are now a witness,

123
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,920
obliged to cooperate with our…

124
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,540
Can you talk?

125
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,240
You saw the murderer, right?

126
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,780
She looked exactly like Miss Cecil, right?

127
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,980
Yes,

128
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,820
but it's not right.

129
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,640
Although they looked exactly the same,

130
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,900
that person is not Cecil.

131
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,660
Why do you think so?

132
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,520
Because she smiled.

133
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,860
Smiled?

134
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,020
She had a really nasty smile.

135
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,520
Cecil would never smile like that.

136
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,060
So tasty!

137
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,180
Is it okay we don't stay in the room?

138
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,560
When we return to Earth,
we have to begin our daily work.

139
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,360
I can't stay in my room right now.

140
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,420
Is it okay that you're here?

141
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,720
What?

142
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
A…

143
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,420
Aes

144
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,520
or Alice?

145
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,980
You have seen Alice, right?

146
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,360
You are Aes.

147
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,780
You two are really alike.

148
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,180
What? We're not alike at all, okay?

149
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,520
Then why are you here?

150
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,480
We can't leave the room for now
because of the murder,

151
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,620
so Alice asked me to get some food.

152
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,560
She's excellent at bossing me around.

153
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,740
Why do the movies stop playing?

154
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,560
Because there was a murder.

155
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,580
Didn't you see this strong Nean?

156
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,620
I have a bodyguard with me,
and whatever the murder is,

157
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,480
I'm the one
who spent a large amount of money.

158
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,100
-Let's go, Huey.
-Is that difficult guest

159
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,860
-Yes.
-the man from the Mars bus?

160
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,760
So he's also boarded the ship.

161
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,200
I'd rather meet a murderer than him.

162
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,920
Aes, it's not safe to let you
go back to your room alone.

163
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,180
Let's head back together.

164
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,880
Say hello to Alice.

165
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,500
You can't leave the room.

166
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,100
Goodbye.

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,300
I didn't expect to see you again
in a place like this.

168
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,900
Well.

169
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,040
Are you also from Aletheia?

170
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,900
Well…

171
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,920
Yes.

172
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,000
We've done our job,
and now we're on a nice vacation.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,380
Is there a problem?

174
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,620
Perfect.

175
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,380
Naomi Orthmann.

176
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,700
I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder.

177
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,980
(Episode 6: Nameless Guest)

178
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,980
Well…

179
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,140
What the hell?

180
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:40,120
Every crime scene
is more or less like this.

181
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,880
After that, the footage cuts out,
and we lose track of the murderer.

182
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,880
Two identical people
appeared in different locations.

183
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,000
Is it the so-called doppelganger?

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,580
What is it?

185
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,820
Just don't ask.

186
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,380
Anyway, arresting you
is just a precaution.

187
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,540
Sorry.

188
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,220
There are two Naomi.

189
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,540
Which one is the real one?

190
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,360
The one with you, of course.

191
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,920
And, are you kidding me?

192
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,140
Honestly, I don't understand it at all.

193
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,160
Then unlock these handcuffs.

194
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,180
I don't trust people from the Aletheia.

195
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,120
After all, someone said to tell me
who the red guy really is,

196
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,180
and then she just ran off.

197
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,820
When this case is resolved,
I have a bunch of questions for you.

198
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,180
Hmm?

199
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,440
Come…

200
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,820
find me.

201
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Wow.

202
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,220
Hell Giallon is on this ship.

203
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,860
I think so.

204
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,200
It can't be wrong.

205
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,160
This series of crimes
is a murder game he set up.

206
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,680
If we play the game,
we'll play right into his hands.

207
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,080
Our job is a secret that no one knows,

208
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,420
even Minister Zhao.

209
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,940
But…

210
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,940
We are about to arrive on Earth.

211
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,360
Stay out of anything
and don't make a fuss.

212
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,540
It's part of our mission
to get back to Gene quietly.

213
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,300
The distinguished Ochrona detective
will handle this matter.

214
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,860
Just stay in your room.

215
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,620
No way.

216
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,400
What?

217
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,460
I don't want to see you
being suspected as a murderer.

218
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:32,380
Knowing that he's going to kill someone,
yet I just stay in my room and do nothing.

219
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,040
I hate it.

220
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,200
A body of the ship's crew member
was found in an airport restroom.

221
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,420
Who is he?

222
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,820
Well…

223
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,600
The deceased crew member
is named Rob Ekatz.

224
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,480
This is a search request
from the Mars Terminal police.

225
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,360
Maybe they have made a mistake.

226
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,600
He's been working room service
since we set off.

227
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,920
He's not a ghost.

228
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,120
That's true.

229
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,760
I've seen him too.

230
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,980
He's the one
who appeared near the first crime scene.

231
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,100
Where is Ekatz now?

232
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,660
2 minutes and 32 seconds ago,

233
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,580
we lost sign of Rob Ekatz in the ship.

234
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,980
Is he really a ghost?

235
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,200
Impossible.

236
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,520
No way.

237
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,440
But apart from this…

238
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,220
Ash, take a look at this.

239
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,220
This is a live footage.

240
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,740
Is this the footage from
before the murder?

241
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,580
Wait.

242
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,580
Noid.

243
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,720
Find out what Ekatz weighed
when he boarded the ship.

244
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:58,320
He went to the library disguised as me.

245
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,340
Wait, it's the real me, I am the real one.

246
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,540
Look.

247
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,340
Well…

248
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,120
Excuse me.

249
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,640
I wonder if it's too late.
What if she's Giallon?

250
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,720
Probably.

251
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,780
Are we going to do it?

252
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,600
Oh, it's you.

253
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,500
Sorry.

254
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,660
I turn off my hearing aid
when I want some quiet time.

255
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,980
It's my secret to avoid my noisy husband.

256
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,180
Don't tell anyone.

257
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,140
It's the real one.

258
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,520
I definitely won't quit smoking.

259
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,080
Detective Ash.

260
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,320
There's been another murder.

261
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,700
That's right.

262
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,040
I'm Rouge, in the prime of my youth.

263
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Ash, what's wrong?

264
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,380
Press here.

265
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,940
This is in front of the library.
Get the doctor here now.

266
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,680
Alright, go chase…

267
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,900
You…

268
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,720
Thank you.

269
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,840
Wait, you…

270
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,480
Darn it.

271
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,340
That's why I hate the Aletheia.

272
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,740
Naomi.

273
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,200
Shoot now!

274
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,260
Well, but which one is the real one?

275
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,740
Can't you tell?

276
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,100
Now let's get started on the Rouge quiz.

277
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,940
Question.

278
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,080
What's 7+7/7+7*7-7?

279
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,500
50.

280
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,400
Why?

281
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,280
How did you tell?

282
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,400
Rouge isn't that smart.

283
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,800
What's 7+7/7+7*7-7?

284
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,000
It doesn't matter.

285
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,580
Got you!

286
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,060
We are from the Aletheia.

287
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,960
ALETHEIA
We will fully assist in this investigation.

288
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,480
Nice to meet you.

289
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Did you find out
how much the murderer weighed?

290
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,160
It's under investigation
as the detective requested.

291
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,380
That old man is really good at it.

292
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,900
Rob Ekatz, 26 years old, 182 cm tall.

293
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,560
He weighed 82.2 kg
at the time of boarding.

294
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,320
Gather and isolate those
who weigh 82.2 kg on board.

295
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,740
It's you two again.

296
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,000
The murderer of the serial killings
is among you.

297
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,120
We're going to interrogate you…

298
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,480
I'm going to beat you now.

299
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,580
What?

300
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,580
Why?

301
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,860
The one who can withstand my punch
is Hell Giallon.

302
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,500
They'd die if they are not the one.

303
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,660
I can still control power of the punch.

304
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,380
And it's the fastest way, right?

305
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,140
Why do I have to take your punch?

306
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,120
My apologies.

307
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,940
E-Enough. You are a girl.

308
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,180
You'll never get married this way.

309
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,660
Does he weigh 82.2 kg?

310
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,120
He's the owner.
The one weighing 82.2 kg is…

311
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,180
Are you going to beat Rubens too?

312
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,640
Rubens.

313
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,440
That's too much.

314
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,080
You're the murderer.

315
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,600
How dare you'd kick such a cute dog!

316
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,760
R-Rubens?

317
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,980
Stop pretending to be a pathetic dog.

318
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,260
Giallon.

319
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,240
You're indeed funny.

320
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,980
You're the funny one.

321
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,200
Alright.

322
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,800
Please follow me.

323
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,780
Ash, you can't get up.

324
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,280
I've always wanted to kill you myself.

325
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,480
The opponent who is a match for me,

326
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,420
let me feel the thrill of potentially
being killed by you, and I will…

327
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,700
So wishes do come true.

328
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,660
Whatever.

329
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,060
Your method of attack is too simple.

330
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:21,760
I've seen right through it from the start.

331
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,120
I'm not listening to a murderer.

332
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,100
Is it really okay for you
to say such pretentious words?

333
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:31,920
You can't avenge
your loved ones like this.

334
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,280
What are you talking about?

335
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,220
Literally.

336
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,820
Is it really you?

337
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,260
Did you do it?

338
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,800
Correct.

339
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,140
Your father, Mr. Roy Junghardt,

340
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:48,920
was killed by me,
who was disguised as you.

341
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,380
Then take what you deserve.

342
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,860
Acting impulsively
at the slightest provocation

343
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,680
is your bad habit.

344
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,600
Goodbye, Rouge.

345
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,260
The filthy meteor falls into hell.

346
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,400
Fantastic!

347
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,060
Captain.

348
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,520
The patrol boat
has issued a command to stop.

349
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,900
Oh my, I've been looking for you.

350
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,420
Thank you for your work.

351
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,560
Who are they?

352
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,240
Artificial Species Audit Department
of the Ochrona.

353
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,840
Naomi?

354
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,880
Rouge Redstar.

355
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:18,360
You have violated the artificial species
utilization regulations, Article 5, Item 9.

356
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,660
I'm taking you into custody now.
