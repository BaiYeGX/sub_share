1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:03,720
Venus Project

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,580
is an unusually large project
to terraform Venus

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,140
under the leadership
of the Planetary Development Corporation,

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:15,140
using the Visitors' super technology.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,060
Venus now

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,620
has the cloud plant in its atmosphere

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,860
that changes the structure
of its atmosphere,

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,300
transforming the environment into one
suitable for carbon-based life forms.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,080
Meanwhile,

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,240
12 artificial black holes
are being used to control gravity,

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,900
slowly moving the Venus towards the orbit
with a rotation similar to Earth's.

12
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,020
Many Neans are manufactured here,

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,200
and they engage in terraforming Venus.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,560
At such a huge cost,

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,580
who is this new habitable space for?

16
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,940
Its true purpose is still unknown.

17
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,710
(Metallic Rouge)

18
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,000
Come in.

19
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,060
Deputy Director Junghardt.

20
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,900
No, you are already
the former Deputy Director.

21
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:53,760
As you used the Proto-Nean
to take actions without permission,

22
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,380
the Ochrona demands the immediate
dissolution of the Aletheia.

23
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,920
Even I, the deity officer,
cannot overturn this decision.

24
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,440
The Ochrona has long wanted
to bypass the Aletheia,

25
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,580
and it has direct access to the Visitors.

26
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,920
It gives them an excuse.

27
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,540
Then…

28
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,520
Did you leak the news?

29
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,140
You are very special.

30
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,200
So, I also anticipated this risk.

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,060
You gave it to me when knowing the risks?

32
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,940
I let you be my subordinate
and stay with Rouge.

33
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,280
So,

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,760
do you want to ask me something?

35
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,680
Then let me just cut to the chase.

36
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,420
I met that Puppetmaster
you were secretly investigating

37
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,980
at the traveling carnival earlier.

38
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,820
Who exactly is he?

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,740
The secret investigation hasn't ended yet.

40
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,400
I had agents track him down,

41
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,450
CERES
but they lost him around Ceres.

42
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,420
Is he a Usurper?

43
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,120
Or is he a human being
who assists the Usurpers?

44
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,880
Or did he let us think that he wants to
join the Usurpers in the inviolable line,

45
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,920
VENUS
but in fact his target is here?

46
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,380
The Venus Project?

47
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,260
For this project, Venus has black reactors
that can produce micro black holes,

48
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:10,480
and this is also the largest
manufacturing base of Nean.

49
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,800
If that was the case,
it would be complicated.

50
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,000
The gears seem to be starting to deviate.

51
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,300
It is necessary to adjust them
before they completely deviate.

52
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,180
That Puppetmaster
interfered with Rouge's memory.

53
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,060
Let me ask you.

54
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,900
Is there something
you're hiding from us about the kid?

55
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,320
No matter what,

56
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,280
since her true identity has been revealed,

57
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,980
Rouge Redstar
will be transferred to the Ochrona.

58
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,620
She will receive
appropriate punishment there.

59
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,200
Appropriate punishment?

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
That's your favorite word.

61
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,740
There's no appropriate punishment at all.

62
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,440
They removed me
from the Junghardt murder case.

63
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,980
Someone must have done something on it.

64
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:00,620
You've submitted many false documents
and done unauthorized searches before.

65
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,140
I think this is a reasonable
and appropriate punishment.

66
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,420
Whose side are you on anyway?

67
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,980
Of course, I'm on your side.

68
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,640
Where are we going next?

69
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,160
We're going to the Aletheia.

70
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,820
I heard that the red suspect was captured.

71
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,620
How can I just sit by and do nothing?

72
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,680
We are not gears for the organization.

73
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
Rouge Redstar,
is she really that red suspect?

74
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,080
Yes, I saw it with my own eyes.

75
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,180
It can't be wrong.

76
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,060
But as the Aletheia is now
under the control of the Ochrona,

77
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,280
I don't think they will help us.

78
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,020
Not to mention it's not our case anymore.

79
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,500
I don't care.

80
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,880
I'm going straight in.

81
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,180
Everything will be fine in the end.

82
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,940
You are too casual in your actions.

83
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,380
You are a lover of murmur.

84
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,580
That's why I hate Neans.

85
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,840
I need Nectar more than chocolate now.

86
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,880
This case has violated Article 5
of the Artificial Species Utilization Regulation.

87
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,700
We determined it to be
the private act of Gene Junghardt.

88
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,380
You will be held accountable for
your leadership as Minister of Aletheia,

89
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,580
and this case is a clear overreach
for the Aletheia,

90
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,780
which has no search authority.

91
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,520
I understand.

92
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,800
So what does the Ochrona
want to do with the Aletheia?

93
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,800
We have asked the Health and Welfare
Ethics Committee to disband the Aletheia,

94
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,440
of course, and to remove you
from your position as Minister.

95
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,900
Minister Zhao.

96
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,240
I'm sorry.

97
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,560
Your application cannot be submitted
without the approval from me, the deity officer.

98
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,220
But…

99
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:45,100
Only I, the Deity Officer, have the power

100
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,220
to give consent.

101
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,880
You're Herman Heyward, executive director
of Panacea Corporation, right?

102
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,420
Why are you here since you are a civilian?

103
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,060
I'm here to help
with that Proto-Nean case,

104
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,780
that is, the Rouge Redstar case.

105
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,860
I heard she can deform into combat mode

106
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,840
like the Immortals.

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,320
What's that called?

108
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,880
I remember it's…

109
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,360
Code name is Metal Rouge, so?

110
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,020
Because she's a precious specimen.

111
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,460
We hope to disassemble her
and conduct a thorough investigation.

112
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,700
After the investigation is over,

113
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,660
our company will take responsibility
to dispose of her.

114
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,700
Rouge Redstar is now under
the control of the Aletheia.

115
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,080
I can't give her to you
without appropriate application.

116
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,820
In this situation,
do I still care what you say?

117
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:42,340
We can't allow a dangerous person be protected
by an organization that violates its rules.

118
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,080
Whether she is dangerous or not
is judged by me, the deity officer,

119
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,280
not you.

120
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,920
That's because you didn't see it,

121
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,420
so you could say such things.

122
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,060
As soon as you see the hole
that guy made in Sarah's chest,

123
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,240
you'll…

124
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,840
Is the Sarah you mentioned
that Sarah Fitzgerald?

125
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,000
One of the Immortal Nine,
Purgatory Viola, right?

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,120
Are you close to her?

127
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,560
Then please leave.

128
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,960
I think she's almost out of Nectar.

129
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,870
Should I ask the higher-ups
if she needs an injection?

130
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,460
NO SIGNAL
What?

131
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,820
NO SIGNAL
Hey, what's going on?

132
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,780
NO SIGNAL
Make a check now.

133
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,830
NO SIGNAL
Y-Yes.

134
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,940
Alright, let's get out of here.

135
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,080
What?

136
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,680
You look like Jill.

137
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,140
Is it my illusion?

138
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,500
I am the real one.

139
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,420
How did you get in?

140
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,140
It's my Nean friend who helped me.

141
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,660
Do you make friends with Neans?

142
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,740
Because I am also a Nean.

143
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,960
Nean… Miss Jill.

144
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,840
What?

145
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,520
You like this, right?

146
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,740
Do you want to eat it?

147
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,280
With your agility, you could escape,

148
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,040
why did you want to be arrested?

149
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,880
This way.

150
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,340
Who exactly

151
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,260
are you?

152
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,720
Where is this place?

153
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,560
What is this?

154
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,600
Those Neans who are judged to be in danger
would be brought into here.

155
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,500
Some will be disassembled.

156
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,920
Others will be…

157
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,800
Everyone is well-preserved.

158
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,040
Those who commit crimes
will be brought to justice.

159
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,720
But we can only be disposed of.

160
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,800
Just because we want to live freely.

161
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,640
Jill, are you one of the Immortal Nine?

162
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,180
Yes.

163
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,180
This is a good look.

164
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,340
Why did you save me?

165
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,980
Because we need you.

166
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,540
We Alters fight for freeing the Neans.

167
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,380
Free?

168
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,120
To be free from the Asimov Code.

169
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,400
To be free from Nectar,

170
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,740
and the curse from humans.

171
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,080
I've told you.

172
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,960
Freedom is the ability
to make your own choices.

173
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,480
The Asimov Code cannot be deleted.

174
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,880
How could you free Neans…

175
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,940
Yes, we can.

176
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,300
You can do that.

177
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,580
You are pathetic.

178
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,580
Gene never tells you
anything about you, right?

179
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,800
Gene…

180
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
My brother only told me…

181
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,280
Your brother,

182
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,660
Gene Junghardt has no long been
the Deputy Director of the Aletheia.

183
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,420
You and your brother are
just gears in the organization.

184
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,960
If the gears don't work,

185
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,160
new gears must be put in place,

186
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,720
then the old gears will be discarded.

187
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,980
So…

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,240
The Proto-Nean has escaped from custody.

189
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,060
The Fuenril squad is headed to
capture Rouge Redstar on the run.

190
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,600
They are my loyal men of war.

191
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,930
(Episode 7: Appropriate Gear)

192
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,980
To conquer or to die.

193
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,600
IDENTIFICATION FAILED

194
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,460
You will die.

195
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,900
Warning.

196
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,880
An intruder appeared at gate 7B.

197
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,480
Security personnel please
handle it immediately.

198
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,680
Repeat.

199
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,400
Warning.

200
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,480
-This way.
-An intruder appeared at gate 7B.

201
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,000
Security personnel please
handle it immediately.

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,440
Repeat.

203
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,320
Warning.

204
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,300
An intruder appeared at gate 7B.

205
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,740
Security personnel please
handle it immediately.

206
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
Sorry.

207
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,100
It's okay.

208
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,760
This is

209
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,560
a decision I made myself.

210
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,700
Neans must not harm humans,

211
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,720
and

212
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,820
must not ignore humans in danger.

213
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,000
Exactly.

214
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,440
This is the death given by Asimov Code.

215
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,860
These are the creators…

216
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,560
This is what humans have given us.

217
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,500
It's so disgusting.

218
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,400
I want to give those creators
who gave us a hard time…

219
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,460
I will give those humans punishment.

220
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,640
Compared to retrieving id from companions,

221
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,180
your rescue is more important to me.

222
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,800
This is also due to my naivete.

223
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:26,280
It turns out to be just some cyborgs.

224
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,280
Quite clever.

225
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,760
Rouge.

226
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,840
Naomi.

227
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,340
Why?

228
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,120
Found her.

229
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,000
Look, she's here.

230
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,160
Rouge.

231
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,580
Why do you think we

232
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,140
have to submit to humans
since we have such strong power?

233
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,240
Flash Silvia.

234
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,420
If you do not choose us,

235
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,900
then I have to destroy you.

236
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,300
Even the Double-Headed Aerkos is here.

237
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,600
Don't be slow. Get moving.

238
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,340
What?

239
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,040
Lost the target.

240
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:11,920
Go chase it.

241
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,280
-Understood.
-Rescue the injured.

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,260
Gears

243
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,080
gradually deviate.

244
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,340
You are also one of the Immortal Nine,

245
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,060
Proto-Nean, right?

246
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:24,920
Why?

247
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,660
Alright, don't move.

248
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,100
Oh my.

249
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,620
Red one, black one,

250
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,860
and a silver one.

251
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,440
What is it now?

252
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,860
Orange?

253
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,280
A child?

254
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,020
No way, really?

255
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,380
Data shows

256
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,600
that she appeared on the passenger list
of the Mars shuttle.

257
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,080
Are you Aes?

258
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,640
Are you really Aes?

259
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,920
Do you want your eyes gouged out?

260
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,880
What?

261
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,160
Alice.

262
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920
I can't believe he wants me to save her.

263
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,660
Aes is really naive.

264
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,220
You are like a broken, abandoned cat.

265
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,000
I can't see what you could

266
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,160
help us.

267
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,400
I'm sorry that Alice
said something rude to you.

268
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,180
Are you two the same person?

269
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,100
Well…

270
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,040
-She didn't really mean that.
-Looks like a personality switch

271
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,000
-What does she mean?
-caused by dissociative identity disorder.

272
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,620
-Well… Cats are quite adorable.
-Put it more simply.

273
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,220
-Yes, they are adorable.
-It's multiple personalities.

274
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,290
-So, Alice is…
-I see.

275
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,100
Rouge's secret…

276
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,760
ERROR
Found defect in the security files of the Junghardt house.

277
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,500
The Junghardt house?

278
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,890
Display surveillance records.

279
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,870
CARL LEONHARDT
This is what you requested.

280
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,490
SPECTER JB7

281
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,660
Rouge Redstar seems to
have escaped from the Aletheia.

282
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,140
Really?

283
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,440
What should we do next?

284
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,260
Of course,

285
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,240
we need to get the gears back on track.

286
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,160
Watch.

287
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,540
Speak up.

288
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,780
Who said to cut down on smoking?

289
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,880
Don't speak.

290
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,980
As one of the Immortal Nine,

291
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:57,280
why do you save me?

292
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,580
We've been running away
from Silvia and the others.

293
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,700
Alice is amazing.

294
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,220
She has access to the information
and supplies we need to survive.

295
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,920
Thanks to Alice,
we could keep running up to now.

296
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,040
Alice was also the one who had information
about the other Immortal Nine

297
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,100
being killed.

298
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,520
And then I found out it's you,
so I decided to approach you.

299
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,120
I'm against that, by the way.

300
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,780
What do you want me to do?

301
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,260
Unlike the other Immortal Nine,

302
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,800
we just want to live a normal life.

303
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,160
Rouge.

304
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,920
Why do you have to hunt us down?

305
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,540
Because it's my mission.

306
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,500
Can you kill anyone for the mission?

307
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,460
Because Gene said you are dangerous.

308
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,320
We are not dangerous at all.

309
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,020
She's just a killer who can't think.

310
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,560
It's useless to say anything to her.

311
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,460
Aes, you're fine,

312
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,600
but Alice is like a villain.

313
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,340
Right.

314
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,540
I'm not that weak like Aes.

315
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,580
Don't you have any doubts
about the missions you receive?

316
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,820
Gene wouldn't tell me
to do something wrong.

317
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,780
You've been mentioning Gene.

318
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,520
How do you know
that guy won't make mistakes?

319
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,580
What do you think?

320
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,280
Are you guys good people or bad people?

321
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,840
You wanted to kill us,
so are you a good person?

322
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,580
I…

323
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,920
It's settled.

324
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,460
You are a bad person.

325
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,740
I am not. I am a good person.

326
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,780
Can someone who wanted to kill us
be a good person?

327
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,960
To us, Rouge, you're a really bad person.

328
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,960
Aes, you need to see the truth.

329
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:47,280
We'd be fools to ask for help
from someone like that.

330
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,820
Hey.

331
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,420
Goodbye,

332
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,480
Miss "Good Person".

333
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,780
You are

334
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,720
really bad at communication.

335
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,900
I see.

336
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,820
So Roy Junghardt was killed
by the Immortal Nine?

337
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,120
That's what Gene said.

338
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,600
The Junghardt murder case
investigation team

339
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,140
is using this footage as a clue

340
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,400
to keep track of you, the red suspect.

341
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,100
This is not me.

342
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,040
This could be the mimic Nean on the ship.

343
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,400
Right, Giallon.

344
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,660
That's him.

345
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,740
He said he did it too.

346
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,200
But,

347
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,420
why would the Immortal Nine
want to kill him?

348
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Giallon has already been killed by me.

349
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,000
Dead men cannot give witness.

350
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,580
I thought I would be dead.

351
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,300
It's your luck if you could die.

352
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,080
Long time no see.

353
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,500
Grauphon.
