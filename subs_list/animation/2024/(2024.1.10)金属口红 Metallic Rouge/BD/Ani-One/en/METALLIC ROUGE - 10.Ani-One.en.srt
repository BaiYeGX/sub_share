1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,940
Is this Scotch whisky?

2
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,880
Sorry, this is Bourbon whisky.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,020
Are you alright?

4
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,460
Your id has been taken away
for quite a while now.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,900
Well, I'm surprisingly holding up.

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,080
Do you mean if I am really okay?

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,540
I am Noir of Immortal Nine.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,140
I am your target, aren't I?

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,620
You saved me.

10
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:32,980
And Gene didn't ask me to kill you.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,540
I see.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
We can't go back.

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,260
I've made up my mind.

14
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,740
I want to witness all of this
to the end for Noid.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,820
But Alter and his men
will be ready on Venus.

16
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
Is it okay if we just simply
go there like this?

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,880
Who do you think I am?

18
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,160
How could I go to Venus
unarmed to pick a fight?

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,580
I have something to report.

20
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,940
Miss Cyan is missing.

21
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,980
What?

22
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:05,020
She disappeared
when I wasn't paying attention.

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,320
Now she's missing.

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,300
I am truly sorry.

25
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,620
Hey, it will be bad if that grumpy girl
starts messing around again.

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,060
Where did she run off to?

27
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,540
She won't run away.

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,260
Compared to that, look at this.

29
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,000
As long as we have this,

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,960
it's as if Rouge and I join forces.

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,300
Don't freak out when you see this.

32
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,540
This is our ultimate weapon.

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,000
What?

34
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:35,840
What?

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,080
Sister.

36
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,750
(Metallic Rouge)

37
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,360
You dropped it?

38
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,300
You dropped the anti-phaser to the sea?

39
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,560
I couldn't hide in with that thing there.

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,440
What's that thing?

41
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,880
That's for analyzing the electromagnetic frequency
emitted when Gladiators are in action.

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,460
And then…

43
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,640
Simply put,

44
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,340
for the phase reversal
from the fight you had earlier,

45
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,800
this device can do the same thing.

46
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,260
Thank you for the explanation.

47
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,260
But you don't have to drop it.

48
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,940
I didn't know it's important.

49
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,420
Why did you come here?

50
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,380
Because I want to be with my sister.

51
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,160
What?

52
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,520
What?

53
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,100
Has her personality changed?

54
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,780
What are you scheming?

55
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,980
Scheming?

56
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,940
You're not supposed to be like this.

57
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,920
Didn't you want to kill Rouge?

58
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,800
I-I didn't want to kill her.

59
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,200
I just wanted to play with her.

60
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,640
What?

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,520
Play with her?

62
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,180
I heard a voice.

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,820
Get rid of Metal Rouge.

64
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,880
Once I hear this voice,

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,520
I must execute the order.

66
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,080
Whose voice is it?

67
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,820
Is it the voice of the person
who created you?

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,380
No.

69
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,060
That's not the voice of the masked father.

70
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,040
You were created by Puppetmaster.

71
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,980
I think she really wants to play with you.

72
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,840
Though it's possible
that she might hear that voice again…

73
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,820
Doesn't every Nean hear the voice?

74
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,100
You've heard it too.

75
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,440
I haven't.

76
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,320
Wait.

77
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,240
Are you a Nean?

78
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,360
What?

79
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,640
Don't you know?

80
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,100
I don't know.

81
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,700
First likes to keep secrets.

82
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,860
Please don't call me that.

83
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,800
What does "First" mean?

84
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,040
That's Naomi's real name.

85
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,160
It is not.

86
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,460
Stay away from Rouge.

87
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,280
No way.

88
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,520
I can't let her go with us.

89
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,500
What should I do?

90
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,380
Got it.

91
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,500
Deal with her using that cold equation.

92
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,400
Are you going to throw her out into space?

93
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,560
You are so cruel.

94
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,940
This kid is a stronger Gladiator
than Rouge.

95
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,460
No one can stop her if she loses control.

96
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,060
She's a stronger Gladiator than me?

97
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,440
In what way?

98
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,200
She knew immediately that I'm a Nean.

99
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,900
And you've been with me
so long, but you didn't notice it.

100
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,540
It means your dullness has lessened.

101
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,220
You're really annoying, First.

102
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,540
Don't call me that.

103
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,880
This ship has an escape pod, right?

104
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,000
Just stuff her in there.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,940
So scary.

106
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,200
First, you are really cruel.

107
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,954
Who knows when she'll hear that voice
again and change back to original state.

108
00:05:59,954 --> 00:06:00,993
There's no need to do so.

109
00:06:01,018 --> 00:06:01,720
No way.

110
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,120
No way.

111
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,100
Wait.

112
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,860
No way!

113
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,960
- She's super rebellious.
- No way!

114
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,900
- Stop now.
- No way!

115
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,260
- You are really being dangerous.
- No way!

116
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,700
Let's play.

117
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,020
Really?

118
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,900
Hmm.

119
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,220
That's great.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,040
Welcome.

121
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,460
This way, please.

122
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,980
This place has been
occupied by us, the Alters.

123
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,300
We sent those Neans
who had been forced into labor

124
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,080
to a safe place.

125
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,940
Do you understand what happens

126
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,740
when Asimov Code is disabled?

127
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,940
Revolution. Slaves will be set free.

128
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,740
This has happened several times
in human history.

129
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,660
Some things must be achieved by violence.

130
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,960
Guys, we have arrived.

131
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,580
Thank you all for coming

132
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,840
to attend the feast I host.

133
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,500
It is a feast for us Neans,

134
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,880
not you.

135
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,240
Puppetmaster.

136
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,120
I thought you were
an agent of the Usurpers.

137
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,060
Looks like you're a human.

138
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,160
Why do you help them?

139
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,820
I'm just an insignificant performer,

140
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,380
and the Usurpers are my sponsors.

141
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,020
They also want to watch
my elaborate stage performance.

142
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,440
We all share the same dream.

143
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,140
How about you and the Visitors?

144
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,760
Do you share the same mind?

145
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,860
The meal is ready.

146
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,980
Please, this way.

147
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,140
This one is my sister, me, and my dad.

148
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,380
And this is the home
we all live in together.

149
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,080
My sister and I would go to school
from here every day.

150
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,300
Is that me?

151
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,620
Your dad is so mysterious.

152
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,280
What does your dad usually do?

153
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,920
Well…

154
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,760
He sells pancakes.

155
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,140
Hilarious.

156
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,880
This is that kind of comic where
you can't judge someone by his look.

157
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,800
My sister and I would
eat my dad's pancakes.

158
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
We sing and dance on holidays.

159
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,780
We play together.

160
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,680
It's a horror comic.

161
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,480
Do you like drawing?

162
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,100
I can be anything in my drawing.

163
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,020
I am free in my drawings.

164
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,660
Free?

165
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,780
But it's actually kind of weird
that you call her sister.

166
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,560
What?

167
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,320
Because Rouge was created by Dr. Eva,

168
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,340
while you were created
by Puppetmaster, right?

169
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,320
That's not weird at all.

170
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,180
My dad also said Rouge is my sister.

171
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,640
Since you were created
based on Rouge's data,

172
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,020
you're technically
her doppelganger, aren't you?

173
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,600
She is my sister.

174
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,520
In other words, you are a clone.

175
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:20,500
Then she's not really your sister.

176
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,940
First, you're a mean old lady
who lives nearby.

177
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,000
Hey!

178
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,220
Oh my.

179
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,500
This is…

180
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,620
Do you like it?

181
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,340
You miss it, don't you?

182
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,600
I recreated the house we lived in
when we were kids.

183
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,660
Are these our ids?

184
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,480
Right.

185
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,060
After all, a family
should stay together, right?

186
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,460
A family?

187
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,160
Aren't I a captive?

188
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,840
It won't be long before
Neans take over the world,

189
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,400
then you will act as the savior of humans

190
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,140
and lead them

191
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,500
to obey our orders.

192
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,020
You are the only one to do it
because you're part of our family.

193
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,960
This is a mission only you can achieve.

194
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,200
I'm flattered.

195
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,480
You can do it.

196
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,640
And you knew it yourself, right?

197
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,060
Let's talk about the difficult part later.

198
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,620
By the way, do you remember

199
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,080
we have gone to play by the lake?

200
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,820
Giallon said he wanted to drive back then.

201
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,800
That was really terrible.

202
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,020
I thought I would die.

203
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,980
This guy's been crazy ever since.

204
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,800
Thank you for the compliment.

205
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,300
Broma chocolate.

206
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,800
Eva bought this for you
on the way to the lake, right?

207
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,840
You split it in half,
and gave me the bigger half.

208
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,720
From then on,
I love to eat this chocolate.

209
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,200
I don't quite remember.

210
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,820
Do you remember that?

211
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Gene and I asked Verde to go boating
with us at the lake.

212
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,700
But he didn't want to get on the boat,
because his books would get wet.

213
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,360
That sounds very much like Verde.

214
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,560
He is addicted to reading.

215
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,620
Achillus is very conscious of the eyes
around her and always dressed in fashion.

216
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,060
Exactly.

217
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,700
She held up her parasol
even it's not necessary.

218
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,240
Nius is very good at swimming.

219
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,800
He swam around
in the water like a dolphin.

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,060
Viola even sang along
with his swimming strokes.

221
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,360
A holiday spent together with family.

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
The best memory ever.

223
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,440
It would be nice if Eden were also here.

224
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,260
Is Eden still alive?

225
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
His id has been pulled out,

226
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,780
so he might be dead
by the roadside a long time ago.

227
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,140
Well, it's hard to say.

228
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,260
Giallon.

229
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,380
Thanks to you, my love,
for showing mercy at the end,

230
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,420
so I can survive.

231
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,160
Stop.

232
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,680
But still,

233
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,440
the wonderful family memory
will fade away.

234
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,000
All the memories will be gone

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,380
and come to an end.

236
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,700
I told you to stop.

237
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,420
I'm sorry.

238
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,120
Thank you

239
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,920
for bringing up
such wonderful old stories.

240
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,160
Go.

241
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,780
No way.

242
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,840
Hurry up.

243
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,180
No way!

244
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,680
To take a bath.

245
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,600
You haven't taken a bath in days.

246
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,620
Rouge hasn't either.

247
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:26,840
I took a bath this morning.

248
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,380
Naomi forced me to.

249
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,720
What?

250
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,320
You're the only one
who hasn't taken a bath.

251
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,940
It won't kill me.

252
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,080
It will.

253
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,280
If some weird virus
starts spreading around here,

254
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,200
that old man will die.

255
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,360
Me?

256
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,140
Humans will die from diseases.

257
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,220
Do you understand?

258
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
I'm busy right now. I'll go later.

259
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,080
As a deity officer,
I request you to take a bath.

260
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,400
No way.

261
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,100
- Stop!
- No way.

262
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,540
Rouge, catch her.

263
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:02,260
- What?
- Sister, save me!

264
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,820
I remember now.

265
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,360
I saw some ice cream in the pantry.

266
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,580
What?

267
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,540
That must be delicious.

268
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,380
It'd be nice to have a cool ice cream
after taking a bath.

269
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,320
What flavor is it?

270
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,420
It's of vanilla and chocolate.

271
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,680
I'll go take a bath.

272
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,380
You know how to handle a kid.

273
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,680
After all, I am a father too.

274
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,140
Do you have a kid?

275
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,600
I haven't seen my kid since my divorce.

276
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,080
Seeing Noid

277
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,780
reminds me of my son,

278
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:40,960
so I didn't get too close to him.

279
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,720
I think I should have talked to him more.

280
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,120
Even in my free time outside of work,
I should have spent more time with him.

281
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,840
The things that we truly value

282
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,140
are always found to be important
after we lose them.

283
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,040
Maybe so.

284
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,980
I also have things I value.

285
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,880
It's my important family.

286
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,140
Do you mean the Immortal Nine?

287
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,080
Immortal…

288
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,280
Yes.

289
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,620
They are as important as my family.

290
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,800
But,

291
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,440
there are more important things than them.

292
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,500
A lover?

293
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,640
Really?

294
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,880
Is it a Nean?

295
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,840
It's just the person I love.

296
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,120
That's all.

297
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,640
If you think of them as your family,

298
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,860
then why are you still on our side?

299
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,060
Because I regret it,

300
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,760
just like you.

301
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,900
Fulfilling the dreams of the one I love

302
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,680
is the least I can do.

303
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,910
(Episode 10: Family Portrait)

304
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,300
Can't you sleep?

305
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,380
Yes.

306
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,940
Everyone has family, valuable things
or a cherished memory with someone.

307
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,820
Memories aren't all good.

308
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,800
That's true.

309
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,700
The fact that they have something
I could never have

310
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,200
makes me feel a bit jealous.

311
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,360
Seriously, I'm on vacation.

312
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,580
If we go head-on,
we'll get shot down and die.

313
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,600
Even if we're lucky enough
to land on Venus,

314
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,980
the real problem would start then.

315
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,740
Sister.

316
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,640
Let's play.

317
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,480
Cyan.

318
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,460
I am discussing something
important with Rouge.

319
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,880
Don't disturb us.

320
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,400
It's you who's disturbing.

321
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,100
I want to play with my sister.
Don't disturb us.

322
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,640
If you hadn't dropped the anti-phaser,

323
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,060
we don't have to work so hard, get it?

324
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,480
Alright.

325
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,680
What do you want to play?

326
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,940
Is that okay?

327
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,820
We'll just go in there and make a scene.

328
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,840
Just like we always do.

329
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,200
Everything will be okay.

330
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,460
Rouge, are you truly prepared?

331
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,620
This battle is different
from the past one.

332
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,520
We must not fail.

333
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,360
You want to save Gene, right?

334
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,820
Isn't that why we're going to Venus?

335
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,980
No.

336
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,560
More than this.

337
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,620
I'm going to stop Silvia and her men

338
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,020
from doing what they're trying to do.

339
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,360
I will protect the freedom
of humans and Neans.

340
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,300
I shall fulfill the wishes
of the one I love.

341
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,500
You are truly prepared.

342
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,100
Then now is not the time to play.

343
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,960
Who is Gene?

344
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,780
That's Rouge's real family,

345
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,780
her real brother.

346
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,720
What?

347
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,700
If he's the real brother of Rouge,

348
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,100
then wouldn't that make him
my brother too?

349
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,480
Alright.

350
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,840
You go play by yourself.

351
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,500
I hate you.

352
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:02,960
What?

353
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,380
I hate Naomi.

354
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,760
I really hate Naomi.

355
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,700
No way.

356
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,640
Naomi.

357
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,420
It hurts.

358
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,000
I must…

359
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,760
I must let her suffer the cold equation.

360
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,820
Did you do so

361
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,600
because you heard someone's voice?

362
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,300
No.

363
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,960
If so, it's your fault.

364
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,960
You can't hurt her
just because you don't like her.

365
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,700
Hmm.

366
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,440
And even if you do hear someone's voice,

367
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,100
you can choose not to listen to it

368
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,860
and make your own decisions.

369
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,000
Make my own decisions?

370
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,040
Exactly.

371
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,240
Can you do it?

372
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,920
I'll try.

373
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,200
Okay.

374
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,840
I want to be your real younger sister.

375
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,100
Okay?

376
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,140
Just like what Gene did for me.

377
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,900
I want to be your real elder sister.

378
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,080
Hmm.

379
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,080
What about Naomi?

380
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,740
What?

381
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,020
What is Naomi to you?

382
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,780
Naomi and you seem to be very close,

383
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,680
so I feel a bit jealous.

384
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,080
Naomi?

385
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,180
Naomi…

386
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,660
Well…

387
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,520
What is Naomi to you?

388
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,740
She's my best friend?

389
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,620
What does it mean?

390
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,100
Well,

391
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,360
sometimes she can be very irritating,

392
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,140
but I can stay with her.

393
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,160
Naomi is my best friend.

394
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,620
What's wrong?

395
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,260
I don't know.

396
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,780
I forgot how to hum the rest of it.

397
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,980
Then start again.

398
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,980
I don't remember.

399
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,360
I still remember

400
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,240
the time when we
went for a row on the lake.

401
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,700
It was a very happy holiday.

402
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,200
At that time,

403
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,560
you looked about my age.

404
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,440
I was so happy because
I felt like I've made a friend.

405
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,940
Me too.

406
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,160
I can't believe
you're part of this operation.

407
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,600
I am against it.

408
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,940
It's that mindless loser Aes,
who's part of this.

409
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,040
I can't stop him.

410
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,800
We have to do it,
so the Proto-Neans can survive.

411
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,060
To survive?

412
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,900
Are you trying to disgust me?

413
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,980
If we didn't share the same body,
I would have killed you myself.

414
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,960
Aes.

415
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,500
Do you think this will be
a good memory someday?

416
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,760
This is…

417
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,300
Fate will bring the soul
to the most appropriate place.,

418
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,000
becoming the key
to unlocking the gate to the future.

419
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,080
In the end,

420
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,140
will they finally be free?

421
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,640
Or…

422
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,820
Is he extracting data from id?

423
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,600
The last guests have arrived.

424
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,380
Rouge.

425
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,380
Now,

426
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,440
our final performance is about to begin.

427
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

428
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,940
please enjoy the show to the very end.

429
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,360
A large number of unidentified
flying objects are approaching directly ahead.

430
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,460
Distance is 17000.

431
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,000
The ship has been targeted.

432
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,320
Distance remains…

433
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,240
Thirteen.

434
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,560
Twelve.

435
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,780
Eleven.

436
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,860
Ten.

437
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,020
Nine.

438
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,040
Eight.
