(Metallic Rouge)

3
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,220
Where's Malik?

4
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,120
He is resting from a cold.

5
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,240
It doesn't seem to be a good year.

6
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,660
Oh my.

7
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,780
Can I take a look inside?

8
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,420
Rouge, please.

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,940
Okay.

10
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,780
Who did you say caught a cold?

11
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,160
Isn't that Malik down there?

12
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,780
Malik.

13
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,400
Malik!

14
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,680
What happened? You died from a cold.

15
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,300
What are you joking about?

16
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,720
Alright, I'm being serious.

17
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,840
Who are you?

18
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,400
Who am I?

19
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,420
Rouge.

20
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,080
Rouge.

21
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,180
Please take this.

22
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,780
Okay.

23
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,340
Don't get in the way.

24
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,840
Sorry.

25
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,720
Sorry, she's still a newbie.

26
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,960
Alright, Rouge. Don't be in a daze.

27
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,580
Look, Sarah is doing it again.

28
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,420
Is it really okay that
she picked up such a kid?

29
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,500
What?

30
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,260
Well…

31
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,380
Here you are.

32
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,220
Thank you.

33
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,620
Hey, Scar Head, hurry to clean up.

34
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,020
As Nean, how dare you slack off!

35
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,260
Sorry.

36
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,340
See you tomorrow.

37
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,460
Good night, Rouge.

38
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,220
Good night, Miss Sarah.

39
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,520
Is yours missing?

40
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,340
I remember it's here this morning.

41
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,860
You can use mine.

42
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,980
No way.

43
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,120
You'll stop functioning,

44
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
and then you'll be scrapped.

45
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,520
Newbie, goodbye.

46
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,680
You too. If you don't get Nectar today…

47
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,880
It's okay. I must have put it somewhere.

48
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,160
Hmm.

49
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,320
Good job.

50
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Who is the boyfriend of our celebrity?

51
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,340
A big shot at Panakea Corporation.

52
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,320
It seems she's found a great sponsor.

53
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,060
Here's to Sarah Fitzgerald,
the Canal Club's popular singer,

54
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,180
the lady who sustains our livelihood,

55
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,580
Right, where's Kevin?

56
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,740
Did something good happen to him?

57
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,760
Look at this.

58
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,280
Nectar can be sold at a good price.

59
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:18,460
I heard if it's injected into one's body,
one can experience the extreme pleasure.

60
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,120
If others pick a fight with you,
I'm not going to help you.

61
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,060
Those guys have Asimov Code
in their bodies,

62
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,880
so they won't resist us humans.

63
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,860
Hey.

64
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,820
Do you know about the possibility
of Nean being an alien spy?

65
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,040
Are you talking about Visitor?

66
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,080
Do you believe that?

67
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,980
What do you think? Beep.

68
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,880
I don't think she is.

69
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,620
Tell me your basis.

70
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,120
Well…

71
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,700
I just have this feeling.

72
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,260
That's baseless.

73
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,820
What about the man she is with?

74
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,760
He's an executive
at Panakea Corporation, named Herman…

75
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,260
Herman Heyward?

76
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,480
That's him.

77
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,600
Although I've been watching them,

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,940
I didn't see the Nectar syringe.

79
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,520
You wouldn't be able to tell if you did.

80
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,900
Aren't you the same?

81
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,920
That's true.

82
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,000
Beep beep.

83
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,180
I need you to stay close to Sarah
and find the evidence,

84
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,500
then you can take action, beep.

85
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,220
I'll meet you at the back of the theater
at noon tomorrow, beep.

86
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,160
For what?

87
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,500
For regular contact.

88
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,760
Oh.

89
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,180
Do you get it?

90
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,240
Maybe.

91
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Got it.

92
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,860
What's wrong?

93
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,500
Are you alright?

94
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,620
Red Gladiator.

95
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,000
Sarah.

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,140
Do you get hurt?

97
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,160
It hurts.

98
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,060
Are you okay?

99
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,340
This is the footage from the scene
of a suburban homicide provided by some citizen.

100
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,690
BREAKING NEWS
However, interference signal appeared

101
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,480
MYSTERIOUS RED FIGURE GOES ON RAMPAGE
around this suspect in the footage.

102
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,860
I think…

103
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,200
-What a problem.
-it must be some radio interference.

104
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,940
Right, I think it's the same guy.

105
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,200
Exactly.

106
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,712
Exactly, that guy also appeared here.

MYSTERIOUS RED FIGURE GOES ON RAMPAGE

108
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,000
The flower sender didn't leave a name.

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,040
I see.

110
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,620
Give it back to me.

111
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,040
Please give Nectar back to me.

112
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,820
I don't know.

113
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,260
What are you talking about?

114
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,820
I'm begging you. Please.

115
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,360
This is also a social reality.

116
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,160
Sorry for the wait.

117
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,680
Well, who are you?

118
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,620
Beep beep.

119
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,300
You're the person inside the bird?

120
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,680
I can't believe there's someone
inside the bird.

121
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,460
What?

122
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,360
Ah.

123
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,140
Nothing, just can't believe
there's someone inside the bird.

124
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,240
Nothing,

125
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,120
just can't believe
there's someone inside the bird.

126
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,480
Hey, is your memory damaged?

127
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,140
Well, who are you?

128
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,200
My name is Naomi Orthmann.

129
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,900
Nice to meet you. I'm here to support you.

130
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,680
Nice to meet you too.

131
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,720
Well, I am…

132
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,780
I know who you are.

133
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,320
Thank you.

134
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,880
Excuse me.

135
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,100
I'd like a large fried rice, double-fried pork,
mapo tofu and two bowls of fried sauce noodles.

136
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,200
By the way,

137
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,600
what about that bird?

138
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,200
It is dead.

139
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,280
Well, I'm so sorry for your loss.

140
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,840
Thank you.

141
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,060
Has anything happened since then?

142
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,400
Well…

143
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,700
I still don't think Sarah is Viola.

144
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,060
It couldn't be her.

145
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,840
I'm sorry to tell you

146
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,700
Sarah Fitzgerald
has been injecting Nectar.

147
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,060
She's Nean.

148
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,040
And chances are
she's one of the Immortal Nine,

149
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,400
Viola Keane,

150
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,180
also known as…

151
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,500
Purgatory Viola.

152
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,990
(Episode 1: Crimson Is the Sound of Dawn)

153
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,600
Please confess your guilt.

154
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,980
Don't do so.

155
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
I wouldn't want to see you again
if I could.

156
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,860
You're so indifferent.

157
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,120
You have to keep your promise.

158
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,260
Of course.

159
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,220
But there was an accident.

160
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,360
I have given you
all the information you need.

161
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,840
Right, exactly.

162
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,640
You tarnished your beautiful body…

163
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,360
No. You offered your body
to get that information.

164
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,500
But all the Nectar were taken away,
and I am so ashamed.

165
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,600
I'm so sorry for you.

166
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,740
But this has nothing to do with me.

167
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,440
It was the red guy who took the stuff.

168
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:04,160
Right.

169
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,240
The one who killed Nius and Achillus,
the enemy of us Alters,

170
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,100
that red Gladiator.

171
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,760
He also appeared here.

172
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,940
What? You're lucky to be safe.

173
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,600
You have to keep your promise.

174
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,980
I feel sorry for you.

175
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,280
After all, once you complete this job,
you will be done with us Alters,

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,940
but unfortunately, it's all in vain.

177
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,720
Giallon.

178
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,380
Silvia suspected you're the one
who leaked our information.

179
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,840
What?

180
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,380
I gave Silvia my full assurance
that you are innocent.

181
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
I almost got killed.

182
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,080
That's the point.

183
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,560
I want to protect you, even though
I have to disobey the organization.

184
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,220
Has anything suspicious happened lately?

185
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,920
Like some stranger approaching you.

186
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,680
You'll have to strike first.

187
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,220
Aren't you going to eat?

188
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,040
I'll just eat this.

189
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,840
What?

190
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,860
What?

191
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,040
What?

192
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,640
This is a restored footage of the suspect
from last night's murder scene.

193
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,440
Who is he?

194
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,140
You'll know when you see it.

195
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,220
I don't remember.

196
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,420
Alright.

197
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,880
I think I know what's going on.

198
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:59,180
The suspect is said to have a similar body shape
to the suspect who's seen at the murder scene

199
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,940
of Dr. Roy Junghardt,
a well-known Nean scholar.

200
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,040
Alright. Have a piece of meat.

201
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,200
I'll just eat this.

202
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,140
Well…

203
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,780
Tonight, could you stay with me?

204
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,500
I came here over the bridge.

205
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,460
I left all my old real self behind
on the other side of the bridge

206
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,000
to become a new one.

207
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,140
What is the real self?

208
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,960
Viola Keane.

209
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,540
I used to like you.

210
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,420
Nean cannot kill humans.

211
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,380
We are not bound by rules.

212
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,980
You are the same as us, right?

213
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,960
Weird.

214
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,640
Am I wrong?

215
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Are you Giallon?

216
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,520
I can't believe I am wrong.

217
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,760
I thought it was her.

218
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,520
I forgot you have the ability to mimic.

219
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,760
The one who attacked me at that time…

220
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,020
Yes, it was me.

221
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,500
Hell Giallon.

222
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,880
Is it him?

223
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,520
Oh no.

224
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,860
Why did you attack me?

225
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,660
I did it for your own good.

226
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,100
I wanted to give you a push.

227
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,360
How could I bear to kill you?

228
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,060
I wouldn't kill you.

229
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,580
I really am gentle.

230
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,280
You've been hesitating.

231
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,620
Can you really kill that lovely girl?

232
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,260
I can.

233
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,600
I doubt it.

234
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,960
That's why I'll do it for you.

235
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,200
Rouge is not that red guy.

236
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,040
She has nothing to do with this.

237
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,680
Is that so? She knows your name.

238
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,240
Viola.

239
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,360
I think she's an agent of the Aletheia
and working for them.

240
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,040
Killing her is just right,
don't you think?

241
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,260
I didn't expect that.

242
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,400
This is really interesting.

243
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
But I have to take my leave now.

244
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,000
You said you can kill her.

245
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,140
Then you're the star.

246
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,960
Come on, it's your show time.

247
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,640
Take her down,

248
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,860
and sing as long as you want.

249
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,480
Farewell, Viola.

250
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,420
Tell me your name before I kill you.

251
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,940
Metal Rouge.

252
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,300
I am one of the Immortal Nine,

253
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,700
Purgatory Viola.

254
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,660
You are good.

255
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,800
Don't dodge.

256
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,580
Naomi.

257
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,200
Let her make a few more moves,
and I can do the analysis.

258
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,100
Why did you kill Nius and Achillus?

259
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,320
Why are you targeting us?

260
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,400
Who exactly are you?

261
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,480
She had part of her arm ion accelerated.

262
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,020
And her arm is also equipped
with a high-frequency vibrating blade.

263
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,060
I just want to sing.

264
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,620
I just want to be happy.

265
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,660
What's wrong with that?

266
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,920
Aren't you done, Naomi?

267
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,180
I've sent it.

268
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,060
Don't be that arrogant.

269
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,040
Tell me,

270
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,120
what's the difference
between us and humans?

271
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,440
I will not die.

272
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,960
I want to survive.

273
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,720
Exceed the pressure resistance limit.

274
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,800
The armor is about to melt away.

275
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:59,280
This is the end.

276
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,520
The first time I met you
was on a rainy day like this.

277
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,240
Where are we going next?

278
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,640
It's been decided.
