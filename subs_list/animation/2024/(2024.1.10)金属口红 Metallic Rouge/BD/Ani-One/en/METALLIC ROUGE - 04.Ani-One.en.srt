1
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,490
CAUTION

2
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,720
(Metallic Rouge)

3
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,420
It seems somehow

4
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,160
the police got wind of Yubal's murder.

5
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,260
The security force will go to you.

6
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,840
If you get involved, it will
be complicated. You better leave now.

7
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,820
I don't want to run away.

8
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,240
What?

9
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,800
I didn't kill him.

10
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,720
It doesn't matter who the killer is.

11
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,860
The police here just want
an excuse to take down CFN.

12
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,500
There is an agent here.

13
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,840
So the one is Phantom Verde?

14
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,740
It is indeed possible.

15
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,980
So I won't run away.

16
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,400
As long as I stay here,
he will come to me.

17
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,060
Then I'll get rid of him
according to the order

18
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,480
and get his Id.

19
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,000
Excuse me, are you really Miss Rouge?

20
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,780
I am Miss Rouge.

21
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,560
Well,

22
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,880
you really have grown up.

23
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,540
It's none of your business.

24
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,220
Alright, then I'll also support…

25
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,420
No need.

26
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,780
I want to go.

27
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,720
I want to be there to support you.

28
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,800
Please let me support you.

29
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,840
What?

30
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,460
This is my free will.

31
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,820
Because we are

32
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,760
neither tools nor spare parts
for the Aletheia.

33
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,440
Up to you.

34
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,180
Then I'll wait for you.

35
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,840
Without a leader, we're in a mess.

36
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,440
I understand.

37
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,520
I'd like to ask you
to explain the situation again.

38
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,840
I have a question for you too.

39
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,920
We don't have to listen to her.

40
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,740
I think she should
be executed immediately.

41
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,300
I've said it many times

42
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,400
she might not be the real killer.

43
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,720
And…

44
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,620
A Nean can't kill another Nean.

45
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,460
Do you want to trust
this Nean of unknown origins?

46
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
Eliminating all those of unknown origins

47
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,800
would make us no different from humans.

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,160
But she could be from Alter.

49
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,400
That's why we need to confirm this.

50
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,740
Calm down.

51
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,660
Sorry.

52
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,080
May I start questioning you now?

53
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,500
You'd do so even if I say no.

54
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,360
Why were you there?

55
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,520
Someone asked me to come.

56
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,120
Did Yubal call you in person?

57
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,620
He sent someone to ask me to come.

58
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,860
Who?

59
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,760
First squad, suppress Location A.

60
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,000
Second squad, suppress Location B.

61
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,140
Arrest all CFN members.

62
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,840
Destroy them if it's necessary.

63
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,560
Commence.

64
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,940
What's wrong with you?

65
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,300
Why don't you answer?

66
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,500
Speak up if you've been wronged.

67
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,100
Are you protecting someone?

68
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,560
But keeping silent won't help you.

69
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,140
Fine.

70
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,200
Let's go back to the first question.

71
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,100
What's your name?

72
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,820
Your name?

73
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,220
Rouge Redstar.

74
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,900
Your date of manufacture?

75
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,780
I don't know.

76
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,340
Are you from Earth?

77
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,440
You're an agent of the Aletheia, right?

78
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,720
This is your first time
on the settlement, right?

79
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,220
What did you see?

80
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,840
What do you think?

81
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,400
Those Neans who are locked up here
and deprived of the freedom to die.

82
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,320
Yubal asked you
to be the hope of these Neans, right?

83
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,200
Don't you want to save them?

84
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,660
That…

85
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,060
That's not your mission.

86
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,080
Right?

87
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,840
It seems Yubal has misjudged.

88
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,760
You can't save the Neans.

89
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,520
Because you're confined too.

90
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,640
You can live more freely
and faithfully to your desires.

91
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,580
Just kill those you want to kill

92
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,040
and save those you want to save.

93
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,180
In this way,

94
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,280
you could save Sarah Fitzgerald.

95
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,900
Don't you love her singing?

96
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,280
You are…

97
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,160
Kill her.

98
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,140
Oh no.

99
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,980
-Kill her.
-Hurry up and open it.

100
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,760
She might not be the killer.

101
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,680
Look, she's breaking free.

102
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,880
She wants to kill us.

103
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,320
Right.

104
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,440
She just tried to attack me.

105
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,960
Kill her.

106
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,920
Don't do this.

107
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,520
Kill her.

108
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,600
-Stop.
-Kill her.

109
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,660
I don't want to hurt you guys.

110
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,640
Kill her.

111
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,800
Get out of my way.

112
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,180
It's the security force.

113
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,200
Oh no, run!

114
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,360
Stop right there!

115
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,660
Get down!

116
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,660
Suppression on 3rd floor is completed.

117
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,640
The body of Yubal 087 was found.

118
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,200
Are you kidding me?

119
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,080
Are you going to abandon Yubal and run?

120
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,760
We have no choice now.

121
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,880
What are you doing? Leave now!

122
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,700
Don't move.

123
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,580
You guys better run.

124
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,100
Let's go, everyone!

125
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
Stand there.

126
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,720
Miss Rouge.

127
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,340
Leon.

128
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,420
The building has been surrounded
on all sides.

129
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,020
Follow me now.

130
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,680
Hurry up.

131
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,020
Damn.

132
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,000
I lost Duma.

133
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,320
Are you serious, Detective Ash?

134
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,380
This is a security operation
within the settlement.

135
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,920
This is no small deal.

136
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,400
Do you think this has something
to do with the red suspect?

137
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,120
Your intuition again?

138
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,780
But how do you get in there?

139
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,100
Who do you think we are?

140
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,780
We're from the Ochrona.

141
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:42,500
Wonderful.
You have that kind of authority.

142
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,660
Please count me in.

143
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,020
(Episode 4: Freedom and Phantoms)

144
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,940
This way.

145
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,740
The red suspect you're looking for
is in this Nean Settlement.

146
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,980
How do you know that?

147
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,020
You're from Aletheia, right?

148
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:28,700
My mission is to search for a special Nean
that can transform into red combat mode.

149
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,660
Are you saying the suspect is a Nean?

150
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,960
Then why don't you use the authority
of Aletheia to get into the settlement?

151
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,600
This is a classified mission.

152
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,080
Therefore, I can't act blatantly.

153
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,960
And we're all after the same target.

154
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,700
So…

155
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,960
What's in it for me?

156
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,020
I'll tell you who the red guy is.
What do you think?

157
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,060
Although I don't like the Aletheia.

158
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,040
Fine, deal.

159
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,140
Wait.

160
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,260
We can't open the door without permission.

161
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,640
We need to talk to the chief first.

162
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,780
The opponent is no ordinary person.

163
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:13,500
Even the security force could be at risk.

164
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,100
It's too late if something happens.

165
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,120
Lurking on the settlement is the suspect
in the murder of Roy Junghardt.

166
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,760
If you refuse to cooperate with Ochrona's
investigation and let the suspect escape,

167
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:29,000
can you take that responsibility?

168
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,500
Open the door.

169
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,000
WELLSTOWN, NEAN SETTLEMENT

170
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,300
Thank you for your cooperation.

171
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
This power is so addictive.

172
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,700
If we go through here,
we'll reach the south part of Wellstown.

173
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,100
Although there may be guards,

174
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,040
I assume it would be no problem
for you with your power.

175
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,240
KEEP OUT

176
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,400
Looks like we can't get any closer.

177
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,000
DUMA 171

178
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,860
Hey, Aletheia guy.

179
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,500
Do you really know who that red guy is?

180
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,320
Where is she?

181
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:19,440
Looks like she ran away.

182
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,780
What do you mean by "my power"?

183
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,540
Because… Aren't you a special Nean?

184
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:31,160
You thought I am a human, right?

185
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,840
How did you know I am a Nean?

186
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,740
What?

187
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,600
Well…

188
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,640
I think I heard that from someone at CFN.

189
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,580
You're not a member of CFN.

190
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,440
Why were you there?

191
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,380
Did Yubal really send you to find me?

192
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,980
Did you already know that Yubal was dead?

193
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,240
Did you kill him?

194
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,020
Although this is just Duma's speculation.

195
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,100
No.

196
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,260
Are you looking for someone?

197
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,840
I didn't kill him.

198
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,200
I was just asked to take you to him.

199
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,180
Who?

200
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,520
I was just trying to help.

201
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,040
If there's anything I can do,

202
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,680
I am willing to do it.

203
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:30,400
I don't want to see
that man in pain anymore.

204
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,540
So…

205
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,400
No, we are different.

206
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,520
I'm not like you guys.

207
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,360
What?

208
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,200
CODE EVE.

209
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,160
It's all your fault.

210
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,400
I've heard it all.
Yubal acted like he's a good guy,

211
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,760
but secretly killed all the Neans
that get in the way.

212
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,340
And you work for him.

213
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,520
-No, no.
-I've also heard

214
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,320
that your true identity is the Red Devil
stained with the blood of your kin.

215
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,320
Actually, I wanted to fight with Rouge.

216
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,460
Desire surges.

217
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,380
Exactly. Be faithful to your desires,

218
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,000
face your desires,

219
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,060
be honest about your desires,

220
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,400
and release your desires.

221
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,500
You want to fight, kill,

222
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,040
and destroy,

223
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,220
and couldn't endure anymore.

224
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,720
But life is so constrained
that it can't be as you wish.

225
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,400
You're a grown-up
and you have to learn to endure.

226
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,700
You are right.

227
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,200
So I'll just endure
with a substitute for now.

228
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,540
Looks like you're a pretty troubled maker.

229
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,740
Rouge.

230
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,280
Rouge.

231
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,520
I can't believe you still can resist.

232
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,760
That's impressive.

233
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,280
You are…

234
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,380
Dr. Afdal.

235
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,420
The agent Yubal mentioned is…

236
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,540
Doctor is not a bad guy.

237
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,200
He just got involved.

238
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,080
He was asked by Duma to kill Yubal.

239
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,780
He's so worried.

240
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,900
I don't want him to do that.

241
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,200
Doctor.

242
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,200
I did it.

243
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,600
Then, you are free.

244
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,500
Please take me with you.

245
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,640
I want to become someone like you.

246
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,160
For everyone, I will join you to be free.

247
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,260
That's just an illusion.

248
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,860
What?

249
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,300
I wasn't worried at all.

250
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,780
I didn't ask you to help me.

251
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:02,740
You took it upon yourself
to think so and do so.

252
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,520
Doctor.

253
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,060
What?

254
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,440
I'm not who you think I am.

255
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,140
Lurking on the settlement,
watching the CFN

256
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,480
and saving those Neans

257
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,620
are just missions I have to do.

258
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,440
Freedom is an illusion.

259
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,840
There's no such thing as freedom
in the outside world.

260
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,000
Humans are definitely not free.

261
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,680
But,

262
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,120
those unconscious humans
may be more stupid than we are.

263
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,020
Afdal.

264
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,900
It's electromagnetic interference.

265
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,280
It can't be wrong.

266
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,140
It's that guy.

267
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,660
That red guy is right here.

268
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,720
Rouge.

269
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,380
Looks like the show has begun.

270
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,680
Too bad I can't be there to see it.
If it is possible,

271
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,780
let's meet again in the VIP seats.

272
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,500
Goodbye.

273
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,960
What's your name again?

274
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,020
Naomi.

275
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,460
Naomi Orthmann.

276
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,800
Goodbye then.

277
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,080
Naomi.

278
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,520
You and I are pathetic beings.

279
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,120
This mist is…

280
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,400
Yes.

281
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,280
It's the nerve gas generated in my body.

282
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,620
I don't want this body at all.

283
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,600
I won't be affected by it…

284
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,360
Stop resisting.

285
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,000
Both you and I are pathetic beings.

286
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,340
We are not the same.

287
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,060
I am not pathetic at all.

288
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,740
You want freedom.

289
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,620
You, Leon, and I are all the same.

290
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,720
No.

291
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,520
There's only one way to get freedom.

292
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,920
No.

293
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,300
Why did you refuse?

294
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,520
Get your freedom, Rouge.

295
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,360
Verde.

296
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,260
Right.

297
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,640
Whether it's me or you,

298
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,080
if we want to get freedom…
