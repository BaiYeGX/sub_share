1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:08,700
ECM is activated. Initiate avoidance.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,460
We can't avoid them all.

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,920
Everyone, prepare for impact.

4
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,800
(Metallic Rouge)

5
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,340
Good morning, Silvia.

6
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,820
Silvia.

7
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,980
Right.

8
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,880
That is your name,
shining in silver brilliance.

9
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,000
Happy birthday to you!

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,340
Birthday?

11
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,500
Just now, you were born.

12
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,220
This is your world.

13
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,660
Our

14
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,440
world?

15
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,320
Thank you for being born into this world.

16
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,180
Your pupils are the same color

17
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,520
as Eva's.

18
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,780
Red Princess is about to arrive.

19
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,960
As you instructed.

20
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,820
I have arranged the reception
for Miss Rouge and others.

21
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,220
Be alert, Opera.

22
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,860
Although my way is somewhat rough,

23
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,880
I have shown mercy,

24
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,940
so they can get here safely.

25
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,580
As you have heard…

26
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,780
A new world is about to begin.

27
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,780
27-degree entry angle is excessive.

28
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,400
We're going in like this.

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,280
What?

30
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,220
They've arrived.

31
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,300
Honestly, I thought we would die.

32
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:12,860
Judging from
where the Puppetmaster parked the ship,

33
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,340
we should be able to get into the plant
through the maintenance hatch.

34
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,040
Is my brother there?

35
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,280
Let's set off now.

36
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,420
Alters and the Puppetmaster
must know we're here by now.

37
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,220
It's too dangerous to stay here.

38
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,700
Right.

39
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,760
Hey, what about this child?

40
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,920
I'll take her with me.

41
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,340
Because she is my family.

42
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,840
Is that okay?

43
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,540
Even if I hear voices,
I'll make my own choice.

44
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,800
Noir.

45
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,400
You must greet them carefully.

46
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,760
The world is about to be born.

47
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,860
Our world.

48
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,360
Your world?

49
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
I thought you once said

50
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,420
that there's a mission
I must complete in that world.

51
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,920
Yes, correct.

52
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,360
Sometimes a mission is assigned.

53
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,860
Not to mention, you are
the son of Eva Kristella,

54
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,360
so you're more obligated
to finish the mission, aren't you?

55
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,780
What do you know about my mom?

56
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,200
I was there at the time.

57
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,140
I was with Dr. Junghardt
on his Nean development team,

58
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,140
so I am very familiar with your mom.

59
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:41,520
As the excellent assistant
of Dr. Roy Junghardt,

60
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,740
your mother
left a glimmer of hope for Neans.

61
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,060
That hope is Code Eve.

62
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,880
She then hid it

63
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,180
in the bodies of nine Proto-Neans,

64
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,060
so that one day it could be retrieved

65
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,580
to grant freedom to all Neans.

66
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,140
How could anyone be so compassionate?

67
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,400
Yet,

68
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:13,340
that love also
turned her life upside down.

69
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,340
Eva Kristella suddenly

70
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,880
disappeared from everyone's sight.

71
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,420
Her disappearance involved a secret

72
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,280
that cannot be shared with others.

73
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:30,940
Right.

74
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:35,120
A secret love that she can't tell anyone.

75
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,680
Who is that object

76
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,680
of her secret love?

77
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,440
Was it someone with a close-knit family?

78
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,320
Was it someone of unequal status?

79
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
No.

80
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,860
Maybe it's not a person at all.

81
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,120
Gene.

82
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,760
My beloved child.

83
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,140
Let me tell you now.

84
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,420
Your r-real father is…

85
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,060
You should stop now.

86
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,780
I'm having a good time.

87
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,740
What a terrible show.

88
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,380
Is that so?

89
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,740
All the world is a stage,

90
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,540
like a puppet show run by invisible hands.

91
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,180
Your mother wanted to sever

92
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,000
the strings manipulating Neans,
known as Asimov Code.

93
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,020
For this,

94
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:37,700
she created Rouge Redstar who held
the final key to decoding Code Eve

95
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,260
and hid her away.

96
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,140
But,

97
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,160
as her child, you used Rouge

98
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,180
to kill the Immortal Nine.

99
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't deny it.

100
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,240
What? Why?

101
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,200
If you communicated with us
properly, it wouldn't have…

102
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,060
He did that.

103
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,940
What?

104
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,200
I have talked to him.

105
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,020
Gene said he wants to create a world
where humans and Neans coexist.

106
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,300
For this, he joined the Aletheia.

107
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,360
However, I cannot trust humans.

108
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,260
The corrupt bureaucracy

109
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,800
will one day devour his ideals

110
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,800
and destroy him.

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,300
And…

112
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,500
You said you didn't have time for me

113
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,940
and killed my father.

114
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,780
It's Silvia who killed my father…

115
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,940
Junghardt knew too much about us.

116
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,180
Then,

117
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,620
she ordered me to monitor him.

118
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,480
But if it's just monitoring,
there's no need for me to do it.

119
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,020
There's still no news from Venus.

120
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,800
It's assumed that all plant systems
on Venus are under the control of Alters.

121
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,640
What is the status of all fleets now?

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,390
JUPITER
We cannot dispatch the main fleet from asteroid belt.

123
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,800
However,

124
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,480
6th Space Corps on the moon
can be deployed.

125
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,080
Wait.

126
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,840
If your attack

127
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,640
stops or destroys the black reactor
containing micro black holes,

128
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,780
it will cause the entire Venus
to collapse.

129
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:24,520
At best, it would derail it
from its current trajectory.

130
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,740
I think

131
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,680
this is unavoidable.

132
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,140
Fortunately, our agents
have now infiltrated Venus

133
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,840
and are on a mission.

134
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,260
Deputy Minister,

135
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,480
can we leave the matter to them first?

136
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,380
I heard your former subordinate,
Junghardt, is on Venus, right?

137
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,600
Yes.

138
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,380
So the chances of getting the mission done
are much higher.

139
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,400
I wonder how many times
I've heard your sweet talk.

140
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,640
I haven't counted.

141
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,180
But your sweet talk
isn't always a bad thing.

142
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,000
(Episode 11: Target Planet)

143
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,120
The traveling carnival
is moored at the 3C Dock.

144
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,160
We can go through the wings of Dock A.

145
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,440
Which route is the best?

146
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,900
We'll take the shortest route if we can.

147
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,040
If we split up, we'll have
to go through the weak spot of security.

148
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,380
We must proceed cautiously and quickly.

149
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,020
Hey, I just finished.

150
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,960
Hey.

151
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,180
Ash, Cyan.

152
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,940
Damn.

153
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,060
We can meet at the carnival ship.

154
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,680
O-Okay.

155
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,440
Where's my sister?

156
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,940
Let's go, Cyan.

157
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,180
Let's race with Rouge to see
who gets to the finish line first.

158
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,900
Hmm, I see.

159
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,780
Ready. Go.

160
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,920
As you instructed,

161
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,260
I have separated them.

162
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,600
Miss Rouge and Deity Officer
are taking the west wing route.

163
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,140
The Detective of Ochrona,
Cyan and Jet Black Noir

164
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,320
are taking the east wing route.

165
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,800
I know exactly what you are thinking.

166
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,860
Do as you please.

167
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,460
Sorry.

168
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:41,620
Are you going to return Noir's Id to him
and fight him head-to-head?

169
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,440
It's really moving.

170
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,300
I am the same as Rouge.

171
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,400
My hands are already
stained with the blood of my kin.

172
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,980
And yet you're here with me
without complaining.

173
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,500
I will definitely come back

174
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,480
for the world where you exist.

175
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,160
Miss Rouge and Deity Officer
have entered the west wing B6.

176
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,260
Go ahead.

177
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,260
Kill the Deity Officer.

178
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:23,100
Do you have anything
to say to your sister?

179
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,080
Please tell her
to kill the man in front of her.

180
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,300
I'll tell her you love her very much.

181
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,200
Rouge.

182
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,280
I think

183
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,540
Cyan has to stay with me.

184
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,620
We need to go to the carnival ship first.

185
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,740
But if I leave her alone,

186
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,720
she will definitely mess things up.

187
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,520
If she really does,
then the other one will be doomed.

188
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,180
After all, she is Cyan.

189
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,300
Indeed.

190
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,440
The Visitor made me into a Nean
who could make reasonable judgments.

191
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,340
Everything I say is correct.

192
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,160
So don't worry.

193
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,680
If the result is good, then is it
considered a reasonable judgment?

194
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,020
But didn't it all work out in the end?

195
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,800
Oh my.

196
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,540
Even if you do use Code Eve
to create a new world,

197
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,680
it doesn't mean that all Neans
will follow you like Grauphon.

198
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,620
In order to provide
the necessary labor on this planet,

199
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,020
there are plants of Neans and Nectars.

200
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,640
All existing materials

201
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,000
can be used to produce Neans
for decades to come.

202
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,460
Even if not all Neans will follow me,

203
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,600
I can keep producing more Neans here.

204
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,780
I can just have them join the fight.

205
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,480
That's proof of our existence.

206
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,180
This is not just a world of humans,

207
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,780
but also a world of Neans.

208
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,640
So…

209
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,980
This will only serve
to benefit the Usurpers.

210
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,480
What's that called?

211
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,980
Profit at other's expense?

212
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,640
Isn't that interesting?

213
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,640
I'll make them regret it
if they want to mess with me.

214
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,320
Aerkos.

215
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,280
Take him back to the room.

216
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,720
Me?

217
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,600
Got it.

218
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,780
After arriving at the carnival ship,

219
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,620
we need to find Code Eve's
analysis machine first.

220
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,760
Don't you look for Gene?

221
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,160
My brother's wish is
to stop Silvia and others,

222
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,140
and safeguard the freedom
of humans and the Neans.

223
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,780
I want to fulfill his wish.

224
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,500
I see.

225
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,700
You look determined.

226
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm flattered.

227
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,480
Eva.

228
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,860
Hey, are you okay?

229
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,040
Noid.

230
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,340
Perhaps we will meet soon.

231
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,620
I have made my choice.

232
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,440
I want to support my sister.

233
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,200
I will protect you and Eden.

234
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,840
Because you're special to me.

235
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,340
What?

236
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,560
Am I wrong?

237
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,820
Then who is special to you?

238
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,100
I don't quite understand,

239
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,880
but we are relying on you.

240
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,120
We are almost there.

241
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,600
Just hang in there.

242
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,240
Okay.

243
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,980
So you wanted to talk with us.

244
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,580
I still remember

245
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,480
you and I caught bugs by the lake.

246
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,480
We found a bug we hadn't seen before.

247
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,180
You all are my family.

248
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,380
That's why I dream of a world
where humans and Neans live in peace.

249
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,920
But, to realize this dream,

250
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,800
you ordered that girl to kill our kin?

251
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,580
You and Silvia are exactly alike.

252
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,540
Whether humans or Neans,
obsessing too much

253
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,720
makes one foolish.

254
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,720
Yes.

255
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,860
There may be other ways to do it.

256
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,580
But,

257
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,140
I don't hate such fools.

258
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,520
Cyan.

259
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,000
My daughter born at the carnival.

260
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,180
I heard the voice.

261
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,720
Didn't you make a promise to your sister?

262
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,260
You said that even if you heard it,
you could make your own choice.

263
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,340
Come here, Cyan.

264
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,880
Come to the carnival.

265
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,420
You can't lose to that voice.

266
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,920
I have to go.

267
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,980
-Come on!
-I have to go.

268
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,080
-You are a strong child.
-I have to go.

269
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,000
Cyan.

270
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,680
Cyan.

271
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,760
Ash, you go stop Cyan.

272
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,880
What?

273
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,220
You're the only one who can stop her now.

274
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,580
And I think it's me he wants to talk to.

275
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,240
Go ahead, human.

276
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,900
I'll wait for you at the destination.

277
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,160
You're back, Cyan.

278
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,080
My beloved daughter.

279
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,500
Masked father.

280
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:48,740
That voice wasn't you?

281
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,540
No.

282
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,980
That was indeed me.

283
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,580
He…

284
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,100
Alright.

285
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,040
This is the last show.

286
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,300
Don't touch that girl.

287
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,560
From now on, you will play a new role.

288
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,620
A new stage

289
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,380
and a new life are about to begin.

290
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,880
I'm so confused

291
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,400
that I was tricked by you.

292
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,420
Damn.

293
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,520
Have Cyan and others arrived yet?

294
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,060
No matter what,

295
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,860
we have no time to stop.

296
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,120
This way.

297
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,500
Where are we going now?

298
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,480
We're heading to the black reactor.

299
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,800
This way will be quicker.

300
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,200
Black…

301
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,360
What is that?

302
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,520
A generator that uses micro black holes
to generate power.

303
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,920
Hurry up.

304
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,760
Okay.

305
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,560
I have to stop Silvia and others.

306
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,400
If I fail,

307
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,060
I will again…

308
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,180
Rouge.

309
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,860
You're safe and sound.

310
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,160
Is this what they call
"asking for trouble"?

311
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,120
I really don't understand.

312
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,600
Don't worry.

313
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,320
Your misfortunate son

314
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,040
is still alive.

315
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,760
Give Gene back to me.
