1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,520
All plans go smoothly.

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:12,770
That's good.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,820
Bless our new homeland

4
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,600
and grant our enemies the joy of death.

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,570
This moment is now upon us.

6
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,720
Dedicate the victory to Junoid.

7
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,440
Damn.

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,720
I was too careless.

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,980
Puppetmaster.

10
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,520
That guy is…

11
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,610
Looks like everything's ready.

12
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,110
Do you like it?

13
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:55,720
This mask is new and specially made.

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,120
After all, this is our troupe's
final performance.

15
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:03,860
It's okay. Don't worry.

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,490
It's an improvisational performance now.

17
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:11,080
There are no written lines
and all the actors play in their own way.

18
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,100
No.

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,070
This is not a play.

20
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,780
Instead, it's the true nature
presented by the actors themselves.

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,170
Everyone here is an excellent actor.

22
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:25,280
They will never bore the audience.

23
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,700
Alright, please enjoy

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,770
this real-life improvisational performance

25
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:33,980
made by stray puppets.

26
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,740
(Metallic Rouge)

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Rouge.

28
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,570
Are you okay?

29
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,500
Gene.

30
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,330
Are you okay?

31
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,810
Thanks to you guys
breaking in here, I could escape.

32
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,790
I always believe you would come.

33
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,820
Thank you, Rouge.

34
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,130
I'm truly moved.

35
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,040
I know where id is.

36
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,680
What Alters did is wrong.

37
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,490
-We must rely on ourselves to build a new world
-Hey, this is…

38
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,400
-that does not discriminate against Neans.
-Right.

39
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,690
We want to build…

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,940
What are you doing, Rouge?

41
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,280
I didn't teach you that.

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,140
I've never been taught by you.

43
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,870
You underestimated us.

44
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,200
How can we fall for the same thing
over and over again?

45
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,080
Boring.

46
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,560
Just play with me.

47
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,710
I have a lot of touching lines to say.

48
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,740
Cut the crap. Where is Gene?

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,360
I'll take you.

50
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,310
I'll take both of you to where he is.

51
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,510
What do you want?

52
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,900
I just want to enjoy this a bit more.

53
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,520
You understand the character
of our Queen, don't you?

54
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
Oh!

55
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,520
She is stubborn and seldom smiles.

56
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,160
And you are like the embodiment of humor,
a combination of funny and witty ones.

57
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,350
Is he complimenting us?

58
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,800
Not at all!

59
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,250
You don't get to talk about us.

60
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,860
Life is all about choices.

61
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,570
Believe it or not, it's your freedom.

62
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,280
Seven of Hearts.

63
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,580
It means to open up the future.

64
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,920
If it's the two of you,

65
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:49,440
I'm sure you can make
this boring long play funny.

66
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,080
All right, please follow me.

67
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,360
Someone is in battle.

68
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,560
Eden.

69
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,230
Hey, can we stop fighting?

70
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,580
Let's call this a draw, shall we?

71
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,170
I would never turn a blind eye

72
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,270
to anyone who stand in Silvia's way.

73
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,080
Are you going to fight anyway?

74
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,560
I will never let go of those

75
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,350
who upset Silvia.

76
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,210
Just feel the pain.

77
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,540
My friend,

78
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,960
take this move of mine.

79
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,960
You misjudged.

80
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,360
There's no point in us doing this.

81
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,640
What Silvia did are wrong.

82
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,140
You should know it.

83
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,300
Ridiculous.

84
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,910
It's no use saying anything now.

85
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,540
There's no turning back the clock.

86
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,960
We can't go back.

87
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,710
My body and soul

88
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:35,960
have long been devoted to love.

89
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,820
Isn't that the same with you?

90
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,040
Noir.

91
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,280
Stop, Grauphon.

92
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,890
Born for love, die for love.

93
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,100
W-What's wrong?

94
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,320
Born for love, die for love.?

95
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,680
These people are really troublesome.

96
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,380
Alright, let's go.

97
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,820
Rouge.

98
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,410
Oh my.

99
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,980
You silly man.

100
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,360
So are you.

101
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,170
Right.

102
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,220
Please

103
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,610
stop Silvia.

104
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:36,450
Stop her.

105
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,680
Okay.

106
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,330
I promise you.

107
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,530
There's another person…

108
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,560
Maybe both of them…

109
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,790
Before,

110
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,190
any time one of us nine had a fight,

111
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,240
you'd step in.

112
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,060
Please

113
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,660
help me.

114
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,080
This is to save Silvia.

115
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,680
But I…

116
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,530
You said it's about survival.

117
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,620
Aes!

118
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:16,760
That low-spirited you is already dead.

119
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,480
If you die,

120
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,610
that means I'm dead too.

121
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,870
Don't just drag me down with you.

122
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,920
The so-called survival

123
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,760
is about choosing and
making your own decisions.

124
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,130
Trust yourself.

125
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,700
Trust yourself?

126
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,820
You said there might
be another way, right?

127
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,660
Do you really think so?

128
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,450
I should be able to find

129
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,760
a new path,

130
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,980
a better path.

131
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,500
You seem to care a lot
about the black reactor.

132
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,600
Not really.

133
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,470
Let me ask you.

134
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:08,660
Are you really taking us to see Gene?

135
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,510
Weird. Where is this?

136
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,680
What?

137
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,990
Sorry.

138
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,040
I seem to have lost my way.

139
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,900
You…

140
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,810
Don't need to be that angry.

141
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:26,450
Isn't life like wandering in a maze?

142
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,960
What a cliche!

143
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,240
Do you know why I say so?

144
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,100
Because your ideas lack depth.

145
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,950
Do you know why you ideas lack depth?

146
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,960
Because you have an empty mind.

147
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,080
Your comments are very harsh.

148
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,230
I brought the guests here as you told me.

149
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,660
You morphed into someone's face

150
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,560
and mimicked someone's behaviors.

151
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,590
But you actually crave others'…

152
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,110
What a boring man.

153
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,660
Oh my.

154
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,110
I've always hated you.

155
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,560
Well, that's great.

156
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,330
Noir.

157
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,760
I need your power.

158
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,360
Please help me.

159
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,760
Please.

160
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,880
Dad.

161
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,960
The improvisational performance
is about to end.

162
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,930
Looks like the final is coming.

163
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,390
Right.

164
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,370
You are the star.

165
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,630
Script?

166
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Haven't I told you?

167
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,230
You don't need a script for your role.

168
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,840
All you have to do is get on the stage
and end the show.

169
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,160
That's it.

170
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,080
I'm giving you one last chance.

171
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,440
Become one of us.

172
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,130
Sacrifice your life for your kin.

173
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,000
Life?

174
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,600
Your id is an analysis machine,

175
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,290
a main unit of the decryptor.

176
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,300
Once your id is installed,
it cannot be removed.

177
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,080
You will proudly

178
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,580
sacrifice your life to save Neans.

179
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,200
No way!

180
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,560
And,

181
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,450
if I die, I'll never
have Broma chocolate again.

182
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,720
Eden.

183
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,810
Gene Junghardt, you're here too.

184
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,250
You are…

185
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,870
Aes?

186
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,630
He's one of us.

187
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,530
He saved me.

188
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,480
If you shoot me with that gun,

189
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,840
the person who will die is definitely you.

190
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,350
Alice.

191
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,620
I-I'm sorry.

192
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,960
That's not the point. I saw it.

193
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,880
I saw that guy called Puppetmaster.

194
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,740
I saw the true face under his mask.

195
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,880
Let's set out.

196
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,080
To close the curtain on the old world,

197
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,680
and

198
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,440
open the curtain of the new world.

199
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,940
(Episode 12: Mask Graveyard)

200
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,210
Please, Rouge.

201
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,730
Don't lose.

202
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,150
Do you know how long
can Neans survive on Venus?

203
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:56,880
Three years.

204
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,570
They can only survive for three years.

205
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,840
In an environment
that even Nean with strong body

206
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,400
could not withstand,

207
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,520
countless comrades
have lost their lives here.

208
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,800
This planet, Venus,

209
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,520
is just as much a battleground

210
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,460
as Mars was.

211
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:23,590
Gene said that freeing the Neans would
lead to chaos and conflicts in the world.

212
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,970
However, that is wrong.

213
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,040
The war never stops.

214
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,130
The war between Neans and humans

215
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:36,870
has never stopped
since the birth of Immortal Nine.

216
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,000
Please win.

217
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,950
If you lose,

218
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,640
I'll have to…

219
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,200
She succeeded.

220
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,610
You cannot possibly win me,
who's fighting with free will.

221
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,820
Absolutely.

222
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,420
You're just a puppet
who only does what you're told.

223
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,240
Rouge.

224
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,770
No.

225
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,710
I've made my choice.

226
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,050
This is my free will.

227
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,460
So,

228
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,680
I'm sure you won't regret it.

229
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,510
After all, you chose to die.

230
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,000
Before your functioning stops,

231
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,590
take a good look with your eyes

232
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,230
and see the moment the world changes.

233
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,690
Damn.

234
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,620
Oh no.

235
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,090
Naomi.

236
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,880
Help…

237
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,110
Help me.

238
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:12,770
Naomi.

239
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,770
Naomi?

240
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,090
Naomi.

241
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,690
Idiot Naomi.

242
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,960
Do you still put orders first?

243
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,940
You are pathetic.

244
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,920
Just live as free as I do.

245
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:45,700
Are you looking for
the control room of the reactor?

246
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,770
If so, it's right ahead.

247
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,100
Why do you help me?

248
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,400
Help you?

249
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,960
I've said it.

250
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,120
I just want to enjoy it.

251
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,890
Before I take my last breath
and my heart stops beating,

252
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,680
even function stops,
I'll enjoy to the fullest.

253
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,580
If that girl can't make it,

254
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,470
you just make the reactor
go out of control

255
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:14,420
and destroy this plant
to prevent the release of Code Eve.

256
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,500
I think that's what you're planning.

257
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,630
Interesting.

258
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:22,850
Those Visitors are really resolute.

259
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:26,770
And I am very much looking forward to

260
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,280
what kind of future you will choose,
Naomi Orthmann.

261
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,720
No.

262
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,130
Goodbye, First.

263
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,620
Access authenticated.

264
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,730
Safety device released.

265
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,640
-Sorry.
-Input wave changes are allowed.

266
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,650
-Although you've been trying to warn everyone,
-Warning.

267
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,110
-I've already blocked your voice inside.
-Input wave energy has exceeded specified values.

268
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,530
-Alright, I know it's dangerous.

269
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,450
-Alright, I know it's dangerous.
-20 percent.

270
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,610
30 percent.

271
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,020
Warning!

272
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,120
-There's a risk of explosion.
-Input wave energy has exceeded the danger level.

273
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,850
-What happens if it explodes?
-Input wave energy has exceeded the danger level.

274
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,580
-Everyone will die, right?
-40 percent.

275
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,990
-Everyone will die, right?
-50 percent.

276
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,260
-We'd all be doomed together.
-60 percent.

277
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:16,980
Everyone…

278
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,670
Warning: Input wave energy
has exceeded the danger level.

279
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,580
70 percent.

280
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,920
80 percent.

281
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,700
Warning!

282
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,520
-Rouge.
-Please reduce the input wave energy below the danger level.

283
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,890
Warning!

284
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,320
Input wave energy
has exceeded 100 percent.

285
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,530
Annoying!

286
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,470
-I got it.
-110 percent.

287
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,030
-Rouge.
-120 percent.

288
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,560
Rouge.

289
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,220
Rouge.

290
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,190
Rouge.

291
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,540
I'm here.

292
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,870
Huh?

293
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,540
I'm here.

294
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,710
Idiot Naomi.

295
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,240
You're still alive.

296
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,480
What?

297
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,810
I'm sorry.

298
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,090
Mm.

299
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,160
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,320
I won't ask you where you ran to.

301
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:17,320
But is it okay that you came back?

302
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,100
Don't you have things to do?

303
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:23,590
Is this your reasonable judgment?

304
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,960
I don't know.

305
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,360
This isn't reasonable at all.

306
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,910
It can't be explained by reason.

307
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,160
It's not something I have to risk to do.

308
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,080
Am I broken or something?

309
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,720
I don't quite understand.

310
00:18:41,507 --> 00:18:44,740
But isn't that what friends are for?

311
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,930
Friends?

312
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,730
We might act like humans.

313
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,930
Then, what are you going to do?

314
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,480
I've decided

315
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,420
I'm going with you.

316
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,820
Idiot, what are you doing?

317
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,800
With Eden as a precedent,

318
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,250
it should be okay for a while.

319
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,760
I need you to get this done

320
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,640
and bring it back to me.

321
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,150
Grauphon.

322
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,100
I always want you to
be with me until the end.

323
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,340
Did Gene Junghardt escape?

324
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,550
It seems Double-Headed Aerkos
has betrayed us.

325
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,480
Never mind.

326
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,200
We are going to make our world…

327
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,770
How would you…

328
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,240
Rouge.

329
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,620
Did you

330
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,200
give your own id…

331
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,250
Are you crazy?

332
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,900
I just lent her.

333
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,730
You two.

334
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,840
Ash, Aes.

335
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,520
Don't worry, Rouge.

336
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,870
Gene and Eden are both fine.

337
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,280
What kind of device is this?

338
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,620
This belongs to the Usurpers.

339
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,340
I've been investigating
a lot of Usurper devices on Mars.

340
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,280
However,

341
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,420
they said I was tomb raiding.

342
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,920
This is the data for Code Eve.

343
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,120
But,

344
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,990
how…

345
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,750
What about Cyan?

346
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,600
Well…

347
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,240
She…

348
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,280
My job is to gather these poor puppets

349
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,600
then liberate them,

350
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,480
and save them.

351
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,400
Rouge.

352
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,590
This guy is Junghardt.

353
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:09,520
He is Dr. Roy Junghardt.

354
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,430
Are you free?

355
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,640
Rouge Redstar.
