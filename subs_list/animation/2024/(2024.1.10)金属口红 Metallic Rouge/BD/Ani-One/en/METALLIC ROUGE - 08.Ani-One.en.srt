1
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,860
Gene.

2
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,300
Gene.

3
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,040
Rouge.

4
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,440
Long time no see.

5
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,580
I got attacked by one of Immortal Nine
while in Ochrona's custody.

6
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,120
They saved me and brought me here.

7
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,560
I have been relieved
of my position as Deputy Director.

8
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,300
Hmm.

9
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,620
I've heard of it.

10
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,620
I'm really sorry

11
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,940
that I put you through a lot.

12
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,920
You two are Ash Stahl and Noid 262
from the Ochrona, right?

13
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,860
Rouge has received a lot of your help.

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,480
Thank you.

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,720
Never mind that, Former Deputy Director.

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,700
You must be the one behind the scenes

17
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,960
interfering with our investigation.

18
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,080
Your reputation for competence
is well deserved.

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,120
My strength is my strong curiosity.

20
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,100
Well, what is that?

21
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,600
Well,

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,040
I have no idea.

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,760
But,

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,500
there might be the answer I'm looking for.

25
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,040
Do you also want to check it out?

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,720
(Metallic Rouge)

27
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,500
In movies,

28
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,880
bad things usually happen
after the people went downstairs

29
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,820
like these that lead to secret basements.

30
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:41,980
A strong curiosity can
be just as dangerous.

31
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,920
You've become quite eloquent.

32
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,200
What is this?

33
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,280
Is it a library or something?

34
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,660
It just looks like a library.

35
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,520
This is…

36
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,420
This is the memories of my father,

37
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,240
Dr. Roy Junghardt.

38
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,460
What exactly is this place?

39
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,840
A place to keep my father's memories.

40
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,000
In short,

41
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,540
it's like a library of memories.

42
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,580
I've heard of an external memory system
that can store human memories.

43
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,880
Storing even one day's memories
requires a huge amount of capacity.

44
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,040
If this is where all the memories
of Dr. Junghardt are stored,

45
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,820
then I am not surprised.

46
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,480
If it were to store my memories, a place
the size of a school library would do.

47
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,120
I want to investigate something.

48
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,260
Do you want to join me?

49
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,740
Sure.

50
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,380
I love it.

51
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,000
Rouge.

52
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,660
I have to know everything about you.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,200
For this,

54
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,940
I need to explore my father's memories.

55
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,020
I want to know more

56
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,000
about myself.

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,700
Who wants to be the priest?

58
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,500
The crow said, "I'll do it."

59
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,700
I have the Bible,

60
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,340
then let me do it.

61
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,140
Who wants to be the follower?

62
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,640
The subject's emotions
are gradually developing.

63
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,540
But they are significantly slower than…

64
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,080
Those of the Proto-Neans
I created in the past.

65
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,740
Compared to
the slow development of emotions,

66
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,120
the physical abilities of the subject
far surpass those of humans.

67
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,360
This is superior to other Proto-Neans.

68
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,240
In other words,

69
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,000
emotional and physical abilities
show inverse growth.

70
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,080
Interesting.

71
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,720
Is this Eva's intention?

72
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,480
Or is it just an accident?

73
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,420
We can eat this together.

74
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,960
It's delicious.

75
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,340
She has a sense of taste.

76
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,040
Taking in excess nutrients

77
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,020
serves no purpose other than pleasure.

78
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
Someday this child will understand.

79
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,240
Rouge.

80
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,120
So indifferent.

81
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,020
I don't feel any love.

82
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,660
What does my father think I am?

83
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,260
Am I just a research subject?

84
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,040
I have no idea.

85
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,140
That's why I want to know.

86
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,760
Me too.

87
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,280
Let's continue.

88
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,700
Yes.

89
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,060
Are you Gene?

90
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,040
From today on, you are my son.

91
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,100
Just like that,

92
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,760
I became my father's adopted son.

93
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,320
It's that person.

94
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,000
How do you know her?

95
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,260
I saw her in my dreams when I got caught
at the traveling carnival.

96
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,660
I can't give it to you.

97
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,880
I will never give you
the data on Code Eve.

98
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,840
Let alone give it to the government.

99
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,040
The Artificial Species Health and Welfare Committee
plans to further control Neans, right?

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
What's wrong with Code Eve?

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,250
It is Code Eve.

102
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,520
Code Eve.

103
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,400
I really regret it.

104
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,080
It's me who made Neans to become unfree.

105
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,760
I should never have written Asimov Code
that makes them subservient to humans.

106
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,280
So Code Eve is the hope.

107
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,780
Code Eve can enable Neans

108
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,160
to be freed from the shackles
of Asimov Code.

109
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,720
This person

110
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,740
is Dr. Eva Kristella.

111
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,840
If you know her, tell us more.

112
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,800
She was a brilliant biophysicist
who died in an accident 17 years ago.

113
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,580
She served as Dr. Junghardt's assistant,

114
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,520
and created Neans with him.

115
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,420
Exactly.

116
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,960
She's also my mother.

117
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,540
The so-called Code Eve

118
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,480
is a program that disables Asimov Code

119
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,820
and frees all Neans from their shackles.

120
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,280
It seems you can be free.

121
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,920
I don't feel anything real.

122
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:22,080
After all, I don't feel
particularly unfree right now.

123
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,900
You Neans are really dumb.

124
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,400
My mother,

125
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,380
Eva Kristella,

126
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,260
refused to give the data to the Artificial Species
Health and Welfare Committee

127
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,700
and destroyed it.

128
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,760
But it was merely a facade.

129
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,040
In fact, this is not the case.

130
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:44,360
She secretly hid the data in the id
of Proto-Neans created by Father.

131
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,440
There are a total of nine Proto-Neans,

132
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,200
and they are

133
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,860
Immortal Nine.

134
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,800
After my mother died,

135
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,260
my father noticed this from
the data she had left behind,

136
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,140
so he began to search
for the whereabouts of the Immortal Nine.

137
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,980
Maybe they noticed what he was doing,

138
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,860
so they killed him.

139
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,380
Why do I recognize your mother?

140
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,060
This is because

141
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,880
Eva Kristella

142
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
is also your mother.

143
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,480
Rouge.

144
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,970
(Episode 8: Nowhere House)

145
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,960
It's Mother who created you.

146
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,340
Rouge.

147
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,960
What's going on?

148
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,380
Why did Father hide this from me?

149
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,300
And why did he observe me?

150
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,200
I have no idea what Father was thinking.

151
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,720
He might just observe you.

152
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,280
It's hard for me to determine
if he loves you.

153
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,940
Because he is

154
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,540
a complicated man.

155
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,020
If…

156
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,360
If Code Eve can truly free Neans,

157
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,640
isn't that a good thing?

158
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,260
Then, Jill and Alter are right.

159
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,860
Why do we have to fight the Immortal Nine?

160
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,140
Did you lie to me
about avenging my father?

161
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,660
It's true.

162
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,200
Did I do something wrong?

163
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,700
No.

164
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,580
I don't get it.

165
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,360
What do you mean?

166
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,700
We have to stop the Immortal Nine.

167
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,440
You've seen what would happen
if Neans were set free now,

168
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,280
haven't you?

169
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,780
Neans also have various problems.

170
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,100
Organizations like CFN and Alter

171
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,960
will surely push for the rights
and freedoms they want.

172
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,220
The rapid changes through violence
would plunge the world into chaos

173
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,840
and further chaos
among the existing Neans.

174
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,840
But there are some Neans
who want a better life.

175
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,140
Right.

176
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,660
That's why we can't cause chaos,

177
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,680
in order to give them a better life.

178
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,360
Now is not the time.

179
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,620
Well, may I say something?

180
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,420
You are both correct,
and neither is wrong.

181
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,220
It's troubling that both freedom
and order are essential.

182
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,340
Then we have to decide what to choose.

183
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,760
Your brother pursues order.

184
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,640
With that in mind, miss,

185
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,800
what do you want to do?

186
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,220
Shall we get started, Deity Officer?

187
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,660
Not yet, just stand by.

188
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,820
What?

189
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,600
Who is that?

190
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,700
Why don't you deform?

191
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,440
Because I'm confused
and I wonder what to do.

192
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,200
Who are you?

193
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
What do you want?

194
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,080
I want to fight you and destroy you.

195
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,520
Alright, deform now.

196
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,840
Fight me.

197
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,620
I don't want to fight.

198
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,740
Attacking someone who doesn't
want to fight is of no fun.

199
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,540
Are you close to me?

200
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,100
I am Cyan,

201
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,220
the one who will kill you,
and I'm also your younger sister.

202
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,300
Sister?

203
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,420
She is…

204
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,800
Let's meet when you want to fight.

205
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,920
Sister.

206
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,500
By then,

207
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,340
just let me kill you.

208
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,540
She kind of looks like you.

209
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,340
The same type of Nean as Rouge.

210
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,940
No, that's impossible.

211
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,060
The one who could make such a thing…

212
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,040
No way.

213
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,000
I was too careless. I didn't think
it would happen so fast.

214
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,700
What?

215
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,640
Officer Khan.

216
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,380
Ash.

217
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,980
I got a report of an attack
on the Aletheia.

218
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,540
Gregory.

219
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,340
Report the situation.

220
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,700
The Aletheia is currently under attack.

221
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,900
I've heard of it.

222
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,440
Can you get someone to pick me up?

223
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,560
Please take shelter inside the house.

224
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,240
We are now landing.

225
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,700
Annoying!

226
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,740
Let's get rid of them now, Grauphon.

227
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,260
You don't need to do it.

228
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,100
I think she's the one
who attacked the Aletheia.

229
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,300
She?

230
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,400
Jill, she comes to get id back.

231
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,120
Sarah, I love you.

232
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,480
You do too, right?

233
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,760
Right?

234
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,060
Did they go to id vault?

235
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,560
Don't come any closer, you monsters.

236
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,400
Don't you dare touch Sarah.

237
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,880
She is mine.

238
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,900
Her singing is so beautiful.

239
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,540
She only loves me.

240
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,940
She only belongs to me.

241
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:13,320
Viola never loves you.

242
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,160
Nius.

243
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,240
Achillus.

244
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,320
Viola.

245
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,480
Verde.

246
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,180
I will not fail you.

247
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,740
I will surely defeat Jill.

248
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,400
Miss Rouge.

249
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,700
Be careful.

250
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,380
Yes.

251
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,560
Do you want to come with us?

252
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,860
I see.

253
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,520
Then you are our enemy.

254
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,680
Code Eve will free us Neans
from the shackles of Asimov Code.

255
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,800
Alter hereby declares war on humans.

256
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,040
And the final key to decoding Code Eve

257
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,240
is the id of you,

258
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
Rouge Redstar.

259
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,900
I'll take it, Rouge.

260
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,360
What a mess here.

261
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,580
Both sides are going all out.

262
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,080
What you want is not me,

263
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,560
but my id, right?

264
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,460
No.

265
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,420
I hope you can fight alongside me
with your own will.

266
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,860
Stop kidding.

267
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,180
I mean it.

268
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,620
You just don't want to face reality.

269
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,040
I do.

270
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,220
I was lost, but now I face the reality.

271
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,340
With my own will,

272
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,400
I will protect the order of this world

273
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,440
and safeguard the freedom
of humans and the Neans.

274
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,160
You really are a stubborn and silly girl.

275
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,940
Please hold on.

276
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,500
Our people.

277
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,420
What?

278
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,920
Ash, the backup has arrived.

279
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,080
Noid, hey.

280
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,320
Damn.

281
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,060
Who pulled the trigger?

282
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,440
Is he a human?

283
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,320
What?

284
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,400
Is the one who got shot a human?

285
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,620
No.

286
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,180
He's a Nean.

287
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,600
OK, he's a Nean.

288
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,480
Yes.

289
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,900
Let's go. We'll cover you.

290
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,060
No need.

291
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,360
Get lost.

292
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,300
Ash.

293
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,840
I don't think

294
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,460
I can make it.

295
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,840
Ash,

296
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,140
your weakness

297
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,840
is that you can't be honest with yourself.

298
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,680
But…

299
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,040
Okay, don't talk.

300
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,680
Why?

301
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,520
As long as I'm with you,

302
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,180
I would forget that I am a Nean.

303
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,020
You should take care of yourself,

304
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,220
and smoke less…

305
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,260
Ash.

306
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,460
Kneel down in front of her.

307
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,460
Metal Rouge.

308
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,340
Do you need any help?

309
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,680
You are…

310
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,840
Who are you?

311
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,200
Didn't we go through
life and death together in the ruins?

312
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,020
Noir.

313
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,600
Noir, you are the Jet Black Noir.

314
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,540
I haven't been called that in a long time.

315
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,900
You finally figured it out, right?

316
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,520
Forget it, Silvia.

317
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,880
I am about to extract her id.

318
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,140
Then all nine ids will be mine.

319
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,320
Actually, there's something
I have to tell you.

320
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,540
Really?

321
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,120
About the reply at that time.

322
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,980
I don't think it's okay
to keep you in suspense.

323
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:37,480
I've been waiting a long time for it.

324
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,900
No way.

325
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,440
I don't seem to get along
with you guys, so I refuse.

326
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,480
Sorry.

327
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,860
Noir.

328
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,000
Tell me what I want to hear.

329
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,600
Aes.
